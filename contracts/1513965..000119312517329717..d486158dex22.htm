determining the amounts paid hereunder on the Closing Date; _provided,

Statement shall be so deemed approved by AMID.

Section 2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment of the Consideration.

_Closing Transaction Expenses_ ") and (v) all SXE Transaction Expenses that
are accrued or due and remain unpaid, or remain unreimbursed by SXE, or SXE
Transaction Expenses that have been paid by Holdings GP, Holdings LP or any
Holdings Company (other than an SXE Company) (without reimbursement by an SXE
Company to Holdings GP, Holdings LP or any Holdings Company (other than an SXE
Company)) (" _Closing SXE Transaction Expenses_ ") (with each of Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Transaction
Expenses and Closing SXE Transaction

 



5  Expenses, determined as of 11:59 pm on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date and, except for Closing Transaction Expenses and Closing SXE
Transaction Expenses, without giving effect to the Transactions or the SXE
Merger Transactions). Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net
Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles. For purposes of clarity, there shall be no
duplication of items among the categories of Current Liabilities,
Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and SXE Transaction Expenses. During the
30-day period following the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, upon
reasonable notice, AMID shall provide Holdings LP and its Representatives
with reasonable access during normal business hours to the records and
employees of AMID and its Affiliates (including SXH Holdings) and shall cause
the employees of AMID and its Affiliates (including SXH Holdings)
to cooperate in all reasonable respects with Holdings LP in connection with
its review of such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the calculations set forth on the Post-Closing Statement as Holdings LP shall
reasonably request and that are available to AMID and its Affiliates or their
Representatives. Not later than the 30th day following receipt of the Post-
Closing Statement hereunder, Holdings LP may deliver to AMID a written notice
(an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") containing any changes Holdings LP proposes to
be made in the Post-Closing Statement. Such Adjustment Notice will describe
the nature and amount of any such disagreement in reasonable detail and shall
be accompanied by such supporting documentation as is available to Holdings
LP. If Holdings LP does not deliver to AMID an Adjustment Notice within such
30-day period, then Holdings LP will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted
and agreed to all items in the Post-Closing Statement. If Holdings LP does
timely deliver to AMID an Adjustment Notice, then Holdings LP will be deemed
to have accepted and agreed to all items in the Post-Closing Statement, other
than such matters that are specifically disputed in such Adjustment Notice.
AMID and Holdings LP will undertake to agree on the Final Adjustment Amount no
later than 30 days after delivery of any Adjustment Notice in accordance with
the foregoing.

 

(b) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to AMID in accordance with
_Section 2.4(a)_ and the Final Adjustment Amount is mutually agreed upon in
writing by Holdings LP and AMID during such 30 day period, then the Final
Adjustment Amount as so agreed will be considered conclusive and binding on
the parties.

 

(c) If an Adjustment Notice is timely delivered to AMID in accordance with
_Section 2.4(a)_ and the Final Adjustment Amount is not mutually agreed upon
by Holdings LP and AMID during the 30-day period, then Grant Thornton LLP (the
" _Accounting Firm_ ") will be engaged by AMID and Holdings LP to resolve any
disagreements (the " _Unresolved Objections_ "). If such accounting firm does
not agree to serve as the Accounting Firm within 10 days after written request
from AMID and Holdings LP to serve, then AMID and Holdings LP will mutually
select and engage an alternative internationally recognized independent
accounting firm, or if AMID and Holdings LP are unable to agree within 10 days
upon such firm or such firm declines to serve as the Accounting Firm, then
each will select an internationally recognized independent accounting firm,
who will then select a third internationally recognized independent accounting
firm, who is independent of the parties, which third firm will then serve as
the sole Accounting Firm hereunder. In connection with the engagement of the
Accounting Firm, AMID and Holdings LP will execute such engagement, indemnity
and other agreements as the Accounting Firm may reasonably require as a
condition to such engagement. The Accounting Firm will determine as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within the 30 days after the

 



6  selection of the Accounting Firm and execution and delivery of such
engagement, indemnity or other agreements, based solely on (i) a written
submission provided by each of AMID and Holdings LP to the Accounting Firm
within ten days following the Accounting Firms selection (and without
independent investigation on the part of the Accounting Firm) and (ii) the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, whether the Post-Closing Statement
requires adjustment. The Accounting Firm shall be authorized to resolve only
the Unresolved Objections, within the range of the difference between AMIDs
position with respect thereto and Holdings LPs position with
respect thereto. In resolving the Unresolved Objections, the Accounting Firm
will be functioning as an expert and not an arbitrator. AMID and Holdings LP
will each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to
the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by Holdings LP and
AMID in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute
and shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination
of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The
determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to such dispute will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on which the Final
Adjustment Amount is finally determined in accordance with this  _Section
2.4_ is referred to as the " _Determination Date_."

(d) The Consideration shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows:

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "
means an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing
Cash as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4 _minus the Estimated
Cash, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Indebtedness minus the Closing Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, _plus_ (C) the Closing
Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
minus the Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (D) the Estimated
Transaction Expenses minus the Closing Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_;

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is positive, then the AMID Common Unit
Consideration shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Final
Adjustment Amount. In such event, within five Business Days of the
Determination Date, (A) AMID shall issue to Holdings LP an amount of AMID
Common Units equal to the quotient of the Final Adjustment Amount divided by
the applicable Equity Price (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form and rounded to the nearest whole AMID Common Unit) and (B) AMID and
Holdings LP shall deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to release all AMID Common Units (together with
cash from any distributions paid in respect of such AMID Common Units) in
the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Holdings LP; and

(iii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Final
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the AMID Common Unit
Consideration shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Final
Adjustment Amount. In such event, within five Business Days of the
Determination Date, AMID and Holdings LP shall deliver a Joint Instruction
Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to AMID out
of the Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement the number of

 



7  AMID Common Units equal to the quotient of the Final Adjustment Amount
divided by the applicable Equity Price (rounded to the nearest whole AMID
Common Units), together with cash from any distributions paid in respect of
such released AMID Common Units. If the number of AMID Common Units in the
Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the entire amount payable to
AMID pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)(iii)_, AMID and Holdings LP shall
deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release the deficiency to AMID from the General Indemnity Escrow
Fund, together with cash from any distributions paid in respect of the
AMID Common Units so released from the General Indemnity Escrow Fund. If the
number of AMID Common Units in the Adjustment Escrow Fund exceeds the number
required to cover the Final Adjustment Amount, AMID and Holdings LP, in the
Joint Instruction Letter delivered by AMID and Holdings LP to the Escrow
Agent, shall also direct the Escrow Agent, after releasing the Final
Adjustment Amount, together with cash from any distributions paid in respect
of such released AMID Common Units, to AMID as provided herein, to then
release and transfer the remaining AMID Common Units (together with any cash
from any distributions paid in respect of such remaining Adjustment Escrow
Units) in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Holdings LP.

 

(iv) After Closing, AMID will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, pay any
Transaction Expenses and SXE Transaction Expenses to the extent such
Transaction Expenses and SXE Transaction Expenses remain unpaid after Closing
and were reflected as Transaction Expenses or SXE Transaction Expenses on the
Post-Closing Statement, as finally determined.

 

Section 2.5 Withholding Tax. AMID shall deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Holdings LP
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
under any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law (and to the
extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and withholding
shall be taken in AMID Common Units, AMID Preferred Units or AMID GP Class D
Units, as applicable). To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Holdings LP in respect of
whom such withholding was made. If withholding is taken in AMID Common Units,
AMID Preferred Units or AMID GP Class D Units, AMID or AMID GP, as applicable,
shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash equal
to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed
sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

practices (or change an annual accounting period), except insofar as may be
required by a change in GAAP or applicable Law;

(iii) except as otherwise contemplated in connection with the Transactions,
amend the AMID Charter Documents or Organizational Documents of AMID GP in any
manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) prohibit or materially impede
or delay the consummation of the Transactions or (B) adversely affect in a
material way the rights that Holdings LP will have pursuant to the AMID GP
Agreement Amendment as a holder of Class D Units to be issued at Closing;

 

(iv) adopt a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation,
dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other
reorganization (other than transactions exclusively between wholly owned
Subsidiaries of AMID) that would (A) prevent or materially impede or delay the
ability of the parties to satisfy any of the conditions to, or the
consummation of the Transactions, or (B) adversely affect in a material way
the rights of holders of the securities of any party hereto;

 



39 (v) take any action that would in any material respect impede or delay the
ability of the parties to satisfy any of the conditions to the Transactions,
in each case to a date after the Outside Date;

(vi) (A) change its fiscal year or any material method of Tax accounting, (B)
make, change or revoke any material Tax election, (C) take any action or fail
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause any of AMID GP,
AMID or their material Subsidiaries that is treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes to be treated as a corporation for such purposes,
or (D) engage in any activity or conduct its business in a manner that would
cause less than 90% of the gross income of AMID for any calendar quarter
since its formation to be treated as "qualifying income" within the meaning of
Section 7704(d) of the Code; or

 

(vii) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 

Section 5.2 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Holdings LP shall, and shall cause the Holdings Companies to and the
respective Representatives of Holdings LP and each Holdings Company to,
immediately cease and terminate any solicitation, discussions or negotiations
with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to or that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Holdings LP shall, and shall
cause the Holdings Companies to and the respective Representatives of
Holdings LP and each Holdings Company to, promptly request that any such
Person promptly return or destroy all non-public, confidential or proprietary

on behalf of Holdings LP or the other Southcross Companies that such Person
received in connection with discussions or negotiations regarding a potential
or contemplated Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Holdings LP shall not, and shall cause the Holdings Companies and the
respective Representatives of Holdings LP and each Holdings Company not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making or submission of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit any Holdings Company or its Representatives from
informing any Person of the provisions of this _Section 5.2_), (ii) conduct
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Persons with
respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) furnish to
any Person any non-public information or data relating to any Holdings Company
or afford access to the business, properties, assets, or, except as required
by Law or the Organizational Documents of such, books or records of any
Holdings Company in any such case in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.
Holdings LP shall notify AMID promptly, but in any event within 24 hours,
orally and in writing if any such Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made to Holdings GP,
Holdings LP or their Representatives. Any such notice to AMID shall indicate
in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or other contact.

 



40 (c) For purposes hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any SXE
Alternative Proposal and any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than AMID and its Representatives) concerning (A) a merger,
consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization or other business combination
transaction involving the Holdings LP Interests, any Equity Interests of
Holdings GP, (B) the issuance or acquisition of equity interests, directly or
indirectly, in any Holdings Company, or (C) the sale, lease, exchange or other
disposition of any significant portion of the properties or assets of any
Holdings Company.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as limiting SXEs rights as
set forth in _Section 5.3_ of the SXE Merger Agreement.

Section 5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.3(d)_), each of Holdings LP and the AMID Entities shall cooperate with the
other and use (and shall cause each of the other Southcross Companies and each
of AMIDs Subsidiaries, respectively, to use) its reasonable best efforts to
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to cause the conditions to the Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly
and fully with any Governmental Authority all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), (ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the Outside Date)
and maintain all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations
of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) defend any Legal
Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions
or seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or rescinded any injunction
or restraining order or other order that prohibits, prevents, restricts or
otherwise adversely affects the ability of the parties to consummate the
Transactions and (iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing (if required) of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and in
any event within 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless a
later date is mutually agreed to by the parties hereto) and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.3_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable (and

 



41  in any event no later than the Outside Date); and (ii) each party shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any
of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect
of such Law on the transactions. AMID shall be responsible for and pay 50% of
any and all filing fees due under any Antitrust Law with respect to all
antitrust filings with the remaining 50% treated as a Transaction Expense.

(c) Each of the parties shall use (and shall cause the Southcross Companies
and AMIDs Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission
with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, including
by providing the other party documents, information and a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon in advance, and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by
a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the
other party) any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) consult with
the other party prior to taking any material position with respect to the
filings under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or in discussions with
or filings to be submitted to any Governmental Authority or prior to entering
into any agreement with any Governmental Authority, (iv) permit the other
party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other party in connection with, any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be
submitted to any Governmental Authority with respect to filings under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law, (v) coordinate with the other party in
preparing and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other
party (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with
any Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law and (vi) consult with the other party in advance of
any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other
Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or
other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and teleconferences. AMID shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the
Transactions and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with
any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining such clearances,
provided, however, that AMID shall consult in advance with the Southcross
Companies and in good faith take the Southcross Companies views into account
regarding the overall strategy. Subject to _Section 5.5(b)_, the
parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) The AMID Entities and Holdings LP (including by causing their respective
Subsidiaries) agree to use their reasonable best efforts to (x) resolve any
objections

 



42  that a Governmental Authority or other Person may assert under any Antitrust
Law with respect to the Transactions, and (y) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, in each case, so as
to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no
later than the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this clause (d)
shall not impose any requirement on the AMID Entities or Holdings LP (i) to
dispose, transfer, or separate any assets or operations, (ii) limit AMIDs
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control,
the Southcross Companies or any of their assets or businesses or any of AMIDs
or its Affiliates other assets or businesses or (iii) limit AMIDs ability to
acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to, the
Southcross Companies.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
with respect to any reference in this Agreement to Holdings LP causing any
Joint Venture Entities to take any action, such reference shall only require
Holdings LP to cause such Joint Venture Entity to take such action to the
maximum extent permitted by the Organizational Documents and governance
arrangements of the Joint Venture Entities and, to the extent applicable, its
fiduciary duties in relation to the Joint Venture Entities.

 

Section 5.4 Public Announcements. The parties shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with
respect to the Transaction Documents or the Transactions and none of Holdings
LP or its Affiliates, on the one hand, nor any of the AMID Entities and their
respective Affiliates, on the other hand, shall issue any such
public announcement, statement or other disclosure without having first
obtained the other partys written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdings LP or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the AMID Entities or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may make any public disclosure without first so
consulting with or notifying the other party or parties if such disclosing
party believes that it is required to do so by applicable Law or by any stock
exchange listing requirement or trading agreement.

 

Section 5.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

 

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Holdings
LP shall, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each of the Southcross
Companies to afford to the AMID Entities and their Representatives (including
its Financing Sources and their legal and tax advisors and accountants)
reasonable access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and
records, the right to copy) to all of the Southcross Companies properties,
books, contracts, records and correspondence (in each case, whether
in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accounting firms,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives. None of the AMID
Entities access hereunder shall include the collection or analysis of
samples, or any invasive or subsurface investigation of property without
Holdings LPs prior written consent, which consent may be withheld or
conditioned in Holdings LPs sole discretion. Except for disclosures permitted
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, each party and its
Representatives shall hold information received from the other party pursuant
to this _Section 5.5_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



43 (b) This _Section 5.5_ shall not require Holdings LP to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of Holdings
LP would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract
or applicable Law to which Holdings LP or any of its Affiliates, including
the Southcross Companies, is a party or is subject or cause any privilege
(including attorney-client privilege) that, Holdings LP or its Affiliates
would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information
and such undermining of such privilege could in such partys good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)
adversely affect in any material respect such partys position in any pending
or, what such party believes in good faith (after consultation with counsel,
which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if Holdings
LP or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and AMID or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, such information being
reasonably pertinent thereto.

(c) Any inspection or investigation conducted by any of the AMID Entities or
its Representatives prior to the Closing will be conducted in accordance with
applicable Laws, including any applicable Environmental Laws, and in such
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Southcross Companies. Holdings LP (and its Affiliates) makes no
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information (if any)
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.5_, and AMID may not rely on the
accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as expressly set
forth in Holdings LPs representations and warranties contained in _Article
III_.

 

(d) If Holdings LP on the one hand or the AMID Entities on the other hand
exercise rights of access under this _Section 5.5_ or otherwise (each an "
_Inspecting Party_ ," and collectively the " _Inspecting Parties_ "), or
conduct examinations or inspections under this _Section 5.5_ or otherwise,
then (i) such access, examination and inspection will be at the Inspecting
Partys sole risk, cost and expense and such Inspecting Party waives and
releases, on behalf of itself and each Person undertaking any such examination
or inspection on its behalf, all damages, losses, liabilities, fines,
penalties and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) and other claims
against the other Parties and their partners and members and their Affiliates
and the respective employees, directors, officers, attorneys, contractors,
Representatives and agents of such Persons (collectively the " _Inspection
Indemnitees_ ") to the extent arising in any way therefrom, except to the
extent of an Inspection Indemnitees gross negligence or willful misconduct,
and (ii) except to the extent of an Inspection Indemnitees gross negligence
or willful misconduct, the Inspecting Party will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Inspection Indemnitees from and against any and all
damages, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) and other claims of any kind or character arising
out of the granting of any such access or the undertaking of any such
examination or inspection. THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION WILL
APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, FINES, PENALTIES AND
EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES) OR OTHER CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF
(A) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF THE INSPECTION INDEMNITEES OR (B) STRICT LIABILITY.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ will survive the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ and the Closing.

 



44 Section 5.6 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.6_, (i) " _Southcross Company Indemnified
Person_ " shall mean any person who is as of the Execution Date, or has been
or becomes at any time prior to the Closing, an officer, manager or director
of any Southcross Company or Holdings GP and also with respect to any such
Person, in their capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee
or fiduciary of T2 LaSalle Gathering Company LLC or T2 LaSalle Gas Utility
LLC, or any person who is an "Indemnitee" as such term is defined in the SXE
Partnership Agreement, SXE GP LLC Agreement, the Holdings LP Agreement, or
the Holdings GP Agreement, each as in effect on the date hereof, and together
with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, (ii) " _Holdings
Company Indemnified Person_ " shall mean any person who is as of the
Execution Date, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Closing, an
officer, manager or director of any Holdings Company and also with respect to
any such Person, in their capacity as a director, officer, employee, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether
or not such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with Holdings LP) serving
at the request of or on behalf of any Holdings Company, or any person who is
an "Indemnitee" as such term is defined in the SXE Partnership Agreement or
SXE GP LLC Agreement, each as in effect on the date hereof, and together with
such Persons heirs, executors or administrators and (iii) "Proceeding" shall
mean any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

(b) From and after the Closing, to the fullest extent that any Holdings
Company thereof would be required to indemnify a Holdings Company Indemnified
Person, AMID shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, jointly and severally,
agree to honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Holdings Company Organizational
Documents as of the Execution Date and ensure that the Holdings Companies
Organizational Documents, for a period of six years following the Closing,
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Holdings Company Indemnified
Persons than are presently set forth in the Holdings Company Organizational
Documents. Any right of indemnification of a Holdings Company Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.6(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Holdings Company Indemnified Person as provided herein.

(c) Holdings LP shall, prior to the Closing, purchase a "tail policy" with
respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to
the Closing that were committed or alleged to have been committed by the
Southcross Company Indemnified Persons in his, her or its capacity as such,
50% of the cost of which shall be treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder
and the other 50% of which shall be treated as an SXE Transaction Expense
hereunder. In no event shall the cost of such policy exceed the Maximum
Amount. The

 



45  " _Maximum Amount_ " shall be an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums for the current directors and officers liability insurance
policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
with respect to the Southcross Company Indemnified Persons.

(d) The rights of any Southcross Company Indemnified Person under this
_Section 5.6_ shall be in addition to any other rights such Southcross
Company Indemnified Person may have under the Organizational Documents of any
Southcross Company, the DRULPA, the DLLCA or the TBOC. The provisions of this
_Section 5.6_ shall survive the consummation of the Transactions for a period
of six years and are expressly intended to benefit each of the Southcross
Company Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if any claim or claims for indemnification or
advancement set forth in this _Section 5.6_ are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims.

 

Section 5.7 Fees and Expenses. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions, including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting
and all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by a party in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Transactions, shall be the obligation of the
respective party incurring such fees and expenses.

 

Section 5.8 Tax Matters.

 

(a) _Tax Treatment of the Transaction_. The parties intend, for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, that: (i) the contribution of the SXH Holdings Interest
shall be treated consistent with (A) a contribution by Holdings LP to AMID GP
of a portion of the assets of SXH Holdings in exchange for the AMID GP Class D
Unit Consideration in a transaction subject to Section 721(b) of the Code,
followed by a contribution of such assets by AMID GP to AMID in a transaction
consistent with the requirements of Section 721(a), (B) a contribution by
Holdings LP to AMID of a portion of the assets of SXH Holdings in exchange
for the AMID Common Unit Consideration and the AMID Preferred Unit
Consideration, and the assumption by AMID of any qualified liabilities within
the meaning of Section 1.707-5(a)(6) of the Treasury Regulations (any
such liability, a " _Qualified Liability_ ") in a transaction consistent with
the requirements of Section 721(a) of the Code and (C) a sale by Holdings LP
to AMID of a portion of the assets of SXH Holdings in exchange for
cash consideration, if any, plus the excess of the liabilities (other than
Qualified Liabilities to the extent provided in the Treasury Regulations)
assumed by AMID over Holdings LPs share of such liabilities immediately after
such assumption, as determined for the purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulations
Section 1.707-5(a)(1), in each case subject to the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-5(a)(5); and (ii) the portion of the indebtedness
actually or deemed assumed by AMID for federal income tax purposes and
identified by Holdings LP as "Qualified Liabilities", which shall be provided
by Holdings LP to AMID at Closing, shall be treated as Qualified Liabilities.
The tax treatment described in the preceding sentence is referred to as the
"Intended Tax Treatment." The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and
otherwise act at all times in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment, except to the extent required by applicable Law or if AMID
determines

 



46  that there is not a more likely than not basis under applicable Law for the
Intended Tax Treatment described in clause (ii) above and Holdings LP is
unable to provide a legal opinion from Locke Lord LLP (or a law firm of
similar reputation) that there is a more likely than not basis for such
aspects of the Intended Tax Treatment. The costs of any legal opinion shall be
borne by Holdings LP.

 

(b) _Tax Returns; Refunds_.

 

(i) AMID shall cause to be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practices (unless otherwise required by applicable Law) all Tax Returns of
SXH Holdings and its Subsidiaries for all Tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be
paid all Taxes reflected on and due with respect to such Tax Returns.

 

(ii) Except as otherwise required by Law, without the prior written consent of
Holdings LP (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), none of AMID, any Southcross Company, or any Affiliate thereof
shall, with respect to SXH Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period: (A) make any Tax election under the Code or any other
Tax law; or (B) file any amended Tax Return or agree to any adjustment of any
item with a Taxing Authority that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax
Return of SXH Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, if in any such case, such
action would have the effect of increasing Holdings LPs (or its direct or
indirect owners) liability for any Taxes or increasing the indemnification
obligations set forth in _Article VIII_. In addition, except as otherwise
required by Law, none of AMID, any Southcross Company, or any Affiliate
thereof shall, with respect to SXH Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, change
the Tax treatment of any item on a Tax Return filed after the Closing Date as
compared to the treatment of such item on a Tax Return filed by any
Southcross Company prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such change
has a material retroactive effect on any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 

(iii) Except to the extent of Pre-Closing Taxes which have been paid by or
otherwise reserved for payment on the books and records of SXH Holdings and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, Holdings LP shall pay (or cause to be
paid), and shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless AMID and
its Affiliates from, all Pre-Closing Taxes owed by or with respect to
SXH Holdings, its Subsidiaries, or the assets and operations of SXH Holdings
and its Subsidiaries; provided that with respect to SXE and its Subsidiaries,
Holdings LP shall only be liable for its proportionate share of the Pre-
Closing Taxes related to SXE and its Subsidiaries (other than taxes payable
by SXE and its Subsidiaries, with respect to such taxes this proviso shall not
apply) based on Holdings LPs beneficial ownership of outstanding equity
interests in SXE immediately prior to the Closing as compared to the
aggregate outstanding equity interests in SXE immediately prior to the
Closing.

(iv) If AMID or any of its Subsidiaries receives a Tax refund arising from or
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of SXH Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, such refund shall be paid to the Holdings LP.

 

(c) _Controversies_. If AMID or any Southcross Company should receive notice
that the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority intends
to audit a

 



47  Tax Return of SXH Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, such party shall, within ten Business Days of receiving such
notice, provide written notice to the other party. Holdings LP shall have the
right to engage an accounting firm or tax attorney, at Holdings LPs sole
cost, who will fully participate at all times with AMIDs designated
accountants or tax attorney, if any, in connection with all matters related
to the audit (e.g. responses to all document requests by the taxing authority,
meeting with representatives of the taxing authority, any settlement
discussions or offers, etc.). If the audit involves only periods and issues
preceding the Closing Date, Holdings LP will take the lead and make all
decisions regarding SXH Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries both before and
after the Closing Date, Holdings LP and AMID will jointly make all decisions
regarding the audit, with the consent of all parties not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Holdings LP and AMID should disagree on
any decision related to the audit, the Accounting Firm shall resolve the
disagreement, with the parties hereby agreeing to follow the action
recommended by such Accounting Firm. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice
is given to Holdings LP of the commencement of any audit and Holdings LP does
not, within 10 Business Days after such notice is given, give notice to AMID
of its election to assume the defense thereof, AMID shall control such audit
and Holdings LP shall be bound by any determination made in such audit or any
compromise of settlement thereof effected by AMID.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed on SXH Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the parties shall cooperate fully with each other,
including, without limitation, the furnishing or making available during
normal business hours of records, information, personnel (as reasonably
required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials reasonably
relevant or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of
audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes. AMID agrees to: (i) retain all books and records with
respect to Tax Matters pertinent to the Southcross Companies relating to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and any extension thereof for the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority; and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Holdings LP, if Holdings LP
requests, to take possession of such books and records. AMID and Holdings LP
shall, upon written request of Holdings LP, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the Transactions).

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration,
documentary, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar Taxes
incurred as a result of the Transactions shall be borne 50% by AMID, with the
remaining 50% considered a Transaction Expense; _provided, however,_ that
any such Taxes incurred solely as a result of the Initial Contribution which
would not have been otherwise incurred with respect to the Transactions if the
Initial Contribution were not part of the Transactions shall be borne
exclusively by Holdings LP. 

 



48 (f) _Treatment of Indemnity and Other Payments_. All indemnity and other
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Consideration, except as otherwise required by Law.

(g)  _FIRPTA Certificate_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Holdings LP shall
deliver to AMID, in a form and manner reasonably satisfactory to AMID, a
certificate of non-foreign status as set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulations
section 1.1445-2(b), dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an authorized
signatory of Holdings LP.

(h) _Tax Election_. Prior to the Closing Date, Southcross Holdings
Intermediary LLC shall have elected to be classified as a disregarded entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes with an effective date prior to the
Closing Date.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the provisions of this _Section 5.8_ will survive the Closing.

TERMINATION

 

Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing: 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Holdings LP and AMID;

 

(b) by either Holdings LP or the AMID Entities:

 

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before June 1, 2018
(the " _Outside Date_ "), including as a result of a Funding Failure;
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available (A) to any party whose breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement will have
been the cause of, or will have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before the Outside Date or (B) to a party if the other party has
filed (and is then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance
as permitted by _Section 9.7_; or

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if such Restraint was due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



60 (c) (i) by the AMID Entities, if the SXE Merger Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to  _Section 7.1(b)_ of the SXE Merger Agreement or

SXE Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_
of the SXE Merger Agreement.

(d) by the AMID Entities, if Holdings LP shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of
Holdings LP set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach
or failure (i) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing
Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_,
_(b)_ or _(e)_ and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured by
Holdings LP within 30 days following receipt of written notice from AMID of
such breach or failure; _provided_ that AMID shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if any AMID Entity
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(e) by Holdings LP, if the AMID Entities shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or
if any of the representations or warranties of AMID set forth in this
Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (i) would (if
it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _(b)_ and (ii) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by AMID within 30 days
following receipt of written notice from Holdings LP of such breach or
failure; _provided_ that Holdings LP shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ if Holdings LP is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement; and

(f) by the AMID Entities, (i) if Holdings LP has received any written notice
that would result in a breach of the representation and warranty set forth in
_Section 3.17(b)_, which breach is not cured by Holdings LP within 60 days
(the " _First Cure Period_ ") or (ii) following the receipt of any such first
notice, if Holdings LP has received any subsequent written notice that,
without giving effect to such first notice, would result in a breach of the
representation and warranty set forth in  _Section 3.17(b)_, which breach is
not cured by Holdings LP within 30 days; _provided, however_ , that if the
breach referred to in clause (i) is cured within such 30 day period, the cure
period referred to in this clause (ii) shall be 60 days (the " _Second Cure
Period_ "). _provided, further_ , that if the AMID Entities terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(f)_, the AMID Entities must give
Holdings LP written notice of such termination within three Business Days
following the end of the First Cure Period or Second Cure Period, as
applicable.

 

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Holdings LP pursuant to either _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ (or is terminated by the AMID Entities pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_, but Holdings LP also gives notice of termination when Holdings LP
has the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ on
the Outside Date), or _Section 7.1(e)_ in either case solely as the result
of a Funding Failure, then AMID shall promptly, and in any event within three
Business Days after such termination, pay the Reverse Termination Fee as
liquidated damages in lieu of all other damages and as Holdings LPs sole and
exclusive remedy against AMID for such termination.

 



61 (b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
7.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party, specifying
the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than the
provisions in  _Section 5.7_, in the last sentence of _Section 5.5(a)_,
_Section 5.5(d)_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article IX_ , all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on
the part of the AMID Entities, Holdings GP or Holdings LP or their respective
directors, officers and Affiliates, except (i) AMID may have liability as
provided in _Section 7.2(a)_, and (ii) except as provided in  _Section
7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_, nothing shall relieve any party from any
liability or damages for Fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Holdings LP pursuant to
either _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ (or is terminated by the AMID Entities, pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_, but Holdings LP also gives notice of termination when
Holdings LP has the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ on the Outside Date) or  _Section 7.1(e)_ in either case solely
as the result of a Funding Failure, and Holdings LP receives the Reverse
Termination Fee, the actual receipt by Holdings LP of the Reverse Termination
Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, and the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Southcross Companies and any other Person against AMID or any of
its former, current and future equityholders, controlling Persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, management companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or
assignees, as applicable, and any and all former, current and future heirs,
executors, administrators, trustees, successors or assigns of any of the
foregoing, as applicable (each of the foregoing, a " _AMID Related Party_ "),
and no AMID Related Party shall have any other liability or obligation for any
or all Damages suffered or incurred by the Southcross Companies or any other
Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
Financing, or the Transactions or the transactions contemplated by the
Financing, or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
the Southcross Companies or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other Legal Proceeding against any AMID Related Party arising out
of this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the
termination hereof), the Financing, or the transactions contemplated thereby,
or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual Damages with respect to the
foregoing, solely in the circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is
payable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, the amount of the Reverse Termination
Fee payable by AMID to Holdings LP, constitutes a reasonable estimate of the
Damages that will be suffered by Holdings LP by reason of any such termination
of this Agreement in the circumstances contemplated by this _Section 7.2_ and
constitutes liquidated damages (and not a penalty).

Section 8.4 Limitations.

circumstances) for indemnification by the AMID Indemnified Persons or
Southcross Indemnified Persons that is subject to indemnification under
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_, respectively, results in Damages that
do not exceed $25,000 (each, a " _De Minimis Threshold_ ") then such Damages
will not be deemed to be Damages under this Agreement and will not be eligible
for indemnification under this  _Article VIII_. The AMID Indemnified Persons
will be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ for Damages,
but only if and to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Damages
exceeds $1,000,000. The Southcross Indemnified Persons will be entitled to be

the AMID Indemnified Persons under  _Section 8.2(a)_ will be limited in the
aggregate to the General Indemnity Escrow Fund, and (ii) AMIDs liability to
the Southcross Indemnified Persons under _Section 8.3(a)_ will be limited in
the aggregate to $21,000,000.

(c) The AMID Indemnified Persons will be entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to _Section 8.2(d)_, in the manner and subject to the limitations set forth
in this Agreement, including those set forth on _Schedule 9.14(f)_.

(d) No Indemnifying Person will be liable for any Damages that are subject to
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a), 8.2(b)_, _8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ unless a
written demand for indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the
Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Person in accordance with the claims
procedure referred to in _Section 8.5(a)_ prior to 5:00 P.M. Central Time on
the date pursuant to _Section 8.1_ on which the survival period of the
applicable representations and warranties or covenants expires.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any party or any of its Affiliates be entitled to
recover more than one time for any Damages under this Agreement, and to the
extent a party or any of its Affiliates is compensated in full for a matter
through the adjustments provided for in _Section 2.4_, such party and its
Affiliates will not have a separate right to indemnification for such matter.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for
purposes of determining (i) the accuracy of any representation or warranty
subject to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_ (other
than the representation and warranty in _Section 3.7(a)_) and (ii) the amount

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ and  _Section 8.4(b)_ shall not
apply to any Damages arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of
any Fundamental Representation, the inaccuracy or breach of any

breach of any covenant of a party, claims for Damages arising out of or
relating to the Special Indemnity Matters (other than as set forth in _Section
8.4(c)_) or to the inaccuracy or breach of any 

 



64  representation or warranty in the event of Fraud; _provided, however_ ,
except for claims for Fraud, in no circumstance shall the maximum
indemnification liability of Holdings LP under  _Section 8.2(a)_ exceed in
the aggregate the value of the Consideration (plus any distributions paid
thereon).

(h) Subject to the other limitations contained in _Section 8.4_, recovery
against the General Indemnity Escrow Units (together with cash from any
distributions paid in respect thereof) pursuant to _Section 8.6_ with respect
to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than
claims for Damages arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of
any Fundamental Representation, any representation or warranty with respect to
Taxes, or any representation or warranty in the event of Fraud) constitutes
AMID Indemnified Persons sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Damages
relating to or arising from any claim that is subject to indemnification under
_Section 8.2(a)_. 

(i) In the event that Holdings LP becomes obligated to AMID under the terms of
_Article VIII_ in respect of any Damages (as determined by a final order,
judgment or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or by mutual written
agreement between AMID and Holdings LP) with respect to any claims for
indemnification under _Section 8.2_ for which the General Indemnity Escrow
Units are not the sole recourse under _Section 8.4(h)_, AMID shall be
entitled to elect to receive, at its sole discretion, and Holdings LP shall be
required to return to AMID, such amount of cash, AMID Common Units,
AMID Preferred Units, AMID GP Class D Units, or any other assets of Holdings
LP, or any combination of the foregoing, with an aggregate value equal to the
amount of Damages for which the AMID Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification. The value of any AMID Common Units to be returned to AMID
under this _Section 8.4(i)_ shall be calculated based on the 20-day volume
weighted average price of the AMID Common Units ending three trading days
prior to the date of payment. The value of any AMID Preferred Units, AMID GP
Class D Units or any other assets to be returned to AMID under this _Section
8.4(i)_ shall be calculated based on the fair market value thereof at the time
Holdings LP becomes obligated pursuant to this  _Section 8.4(i)_. For
purposes of this _Section 8.4(i)_ "fair market value" shall be determined by
(A) the mutual agreement of AMID and Holdings LP or (B) if AMID and Holdings
LP cannot mutually agree on fair market value, AMID and Holdings LP will
mutually select and engage an independent third party appraiser (the "
_Appraiser_ ") (or if AMID and Holdings LP are unable to agree within 10 days
upon such independent third party appraiser, then each will promptly select
an independent third party appraiser, who will then select an independent
third party appraiser, which third selected independent third party appraiser
will then serve as the sole Appraiser hereunder). In connection with the
engagement of the Appraiser, AMID and Holdings LP will execute such
engagement, indemnity and other agreements as the Appraiser may reasonably
require as a condition to such engagement. The Appraiser will determine as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within the 30 days after the
selection of the Appraiser and execution and delivery of such engagement,
indemnity or other agreements, the fair market value of the AMID Preferred
Units, AMID GP Class D Units or any other assets, as applicable. The
determination of the Appraiser with respect to such fair market value
determination will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The fees
and expenses of the Appraiser will be borne 50% by AMID and 50% by
Holdings LP.

Section 8.5 Claims Procedures.

 



65 (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person seeking indemnification (the "
_Indemnified Person_ ") of notice (i) of the commencement or assertion of any
claim or Legal Proceeding by a third party or (ii) of facts causing any
Indemnified Person to believe it has a claim for indemnification hereunder
(an " _Indemnity Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person will give prompt written
notice thereof (the " _Claim Notice_ ") to Holdings LP or to AMID, as
applicable (Holdings LP or AMID, as applicable, the " _Indemnifying Person_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as the Claim Notice is given within
the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 8.1_, the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of
its obligations or liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Person. The Claim Notice will describe
the Indemnity Claim in reasonable detail, and will indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary) of the Damages that has been or may be suffered and
the provisions under this Agreement on which such claim is based. The
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person agree to keep each other
reasonably appraised of any additional information concerning any Indemnity
Claim.

(b) As to the defense of an Indemnity Claim arising from a third party action,
the Indemnifying Person will be, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 8.5_ and subject to the Indemnifying Persons prior confirmation in
writing to the Indemnified Person(s) that the Indemnity Claim is covered as
an indemnified claim under this Agreement within 30 days of receipt of a
Claim Notice from the Indemnified Person, entitled to assume control of and
appoint lead counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person for
such defense, at the cost of the Indemnifying Person. The Indemnifying Person
will keep the Indemnified Person(s) advised of the status of such third party
action and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis and will consider
in good faith the recommendations made by the Indemnified Person(s) with
respect thereto. The Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Person(s) for any period
during which the Indemnifying Person has failed to assume the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the control of the
defense of any third party action in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 8.5_, the Indemnified Person(s) will be entitled to participate in
the defense of any such third party action and to engage, at its expense,
separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, it being understood, however,
that the Indemnifying Person will continue to control such defense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Person will not be able to
control the defense of any claim arising from a third party action if the
third party action is (A) for equitable or injunctive relief or any claim that
would impose criminal liability or criminal damages, (B) in the reasonable
opinion of the Indemnified Person(s), the third party action could have a
material adverse effect on its business, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Indemnified Persons,
or (C) the claim alleges Damages in excess of the Indemnifying Persons
maximum indemnification obligations under this Agreement.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 8.5(d)_, if the Indemnifying Person does not
expressly elect to assume the defense of such third party action within the
time period and otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this
_Section 8.5(b)_, is not otherwise entitled to assume the defense of such
third party action under the last sentence of _Section 8.5(b)_ or after
assuming the defense of a third party action, fails to take commercially
reasonable steps necessary to diligently defend such third party action, the
Indemnified Person(s) shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and
to settle such third party action, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Person.

 



66 (d) If the Indemnified Person has assumed the defense of a third party action
pursuant to this  _Section 8.5_, (i) it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to diligently defend such third party action, (ii) it will keep the
Indemnifying Person advised of the status of such third party action and the
defense thereof on a reasonably current basis, (iii) it will reasonably
consult with the Indemnifying Person with respect to the defense and
settlement thereof, (iv) it will consider in good faith the recommendations
made by the Indemnifying Person with respect thereto and (v) it will not
agree to any settlement thereof without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnifying Person will obtain the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person(s) before entering into any
settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgement of the validity of such
Indemnity Claim if the settlement requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing
on the part of the Indemnified Person(s), subjects the Indemnified Person(s)
to criminal liability or does not unconditionally release the Indemnified
Person(s) from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Indemnity
Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against,
or any continuing obligation or payment requirement on, the Indemnified
Person(s) and (ii) the Indemnified Person(s) will be entitled to participate
in the defense of such Indemnity Claim and to engage separate counsel of its
choice for such purpose at its own cost and expense unless (A) the engagement
of such counsel or incurrence of such expenses shall have been specifically
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Person or (iii) the named parties to
the third party action include both an Indemnified Person(s) and an
Indemnifying Person, and the Indemnified Person(s) reasonably determines after
consultation with outside legal counsel that representation by counsel to the
Indemnifying Person of both the Indemnifying Person, and the Indemnified
Person(s) would present such counsel with a conflict of interest.

(f) Each party will cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Indemnity
Claim arising from a third party action and will furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony (subject to any applicable
confidentiality agreement), and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. The Indemnifying Person will reimburse the
Indemnified Person(s) for all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Person(s) in connection with the investigation and defense of the third party
action prior to the date the Indemnifying Person validly exercised its right
to assume the investigation and defense of the third party action.

 

(g) In the case of an Indemnity Claim not based upon a third party action ("
_Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Person shall have 20 days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to either (i) admit its obligation to provide
indemnification, (ii) agree that the Indemnified Person(s) is entitled to
receive part, but not all of the indemnification obligation or (ii) dispute
the Claim for indemnification, and provide a written explanation for its
position and supporting documentation. If the Indemnifying Person does not
notify the Indemnified Person(s) within 30 days following its receipt of a
Claim Notice in respect of a Direct Claim that the Indemnifying Person
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Person(s) hereunder, such Direct
Claim specified by the Indemnified Person(s) in such Claim Notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Person hereunder and the
Indemnifying Person shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified
Person(s) on demand. In the event that the Indemnifying Person

 



67  disputes a Claim Notice for a Direct Claim, the parties, including
appropriate management representatives, shall promptly seek to negotiate a
resolution in good faith. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute
within 120 days after the Indemnifying Person first receives the Claim Notice
for a Direct Claim, then the Indemnified Person(s) may seek any remedy
available to it under this Agreement.

 

Section 8.6 Claims Against Indemnity Escrow Units.

 

(a) Pursuant to _Section 2.2_, at the Closing, AMID shall transfer the
Indemnity Escrow Units to the Escrow Agent, as escrow agent to AMID and
Holdings LP, for deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Fund. The Indemnity Escrow
Units shall be held and distributed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) The Indemnity Escrow Units (together with cash from any distributions paid
in respect of such Indemnity Escrow Units) shall be disbursed by the Escrow
Agent as follows:

(i) pursuant to _Section 8.6(c)_ in accordance with written instructions that
are jointly signed by Holdings LP and AMID, which instructions shall be in a
form that complies with the requirements of the Escrow Agreement (a " _Joint
Instruction Letter_ ");

 

(ii) pursuant to a final, non-appealable award, judgment, decision or order
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction specifying the amount of
Indemnity Escrow Units (which shall be rounded to the nearest whole unit upon
each disbursement) to be released and the Person or Persons to whom such
Indemnity Escrow Units shall be released, together with cash from any
distributions paid in respect of such released Indemnity Escrow Units; or

(iii) as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that Holdings LP becomes obligated to AMID under the terms of
_Article VIII_ in respect of any Damages (as determined by a final order,
judgment or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or by mutual written
agreement between AMID and Holdings LP) and at such time there are remaining
Indemnity Escrow Units (together with cash from any distributions
paid thereon) in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, then, except as provided in
_Section 8.4(i)_, Holdings LP and AMID shall execute and deliver a Joint
Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release
to AMID that portion of the Indemnity Escrow Units required to satisfy such
obligation (to the extent the Indemnity Escrow Units (together with cash from
any distributions paid thereon) then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund
are sufficient to satisfy such obligation). The number of Indemnity Escrow
Units to be disbursed hereunder shall be determined by dividing the amount of
Damages in respect of which Holdings LP is obligated by the applicable Equity
Price, rounded to the nearest whole unit, and neither such number of
Indemnity Escrow Units nor such Damages shall be reduced by the disbursement
of any cash from any distributions paid in respect thereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) the General
Indemnity Escrow Units and the Special Indemnity Escrow Units shall be held
in separate accounts by the Escrow Agent, (ii) if the number of Special
Indemnity Escrow Units in the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to
cover the entire amount of claims for Special 

 



68  Indemnity Damages, the General Indemnity Escrow Units (together with cash
from any distributions paid in respect thereof) may be used to satisfy claims
for Special Indemnity Damages at the AMID Indemnified Persons sole
discretion, and (iii) the Special Indemnity Escrow Units shall not be used to
satisfy claims other than those for Special Indemnity Damages, and may not be
retained in escrow to satisfy any claims other than those for Special
Indemnity Damages.

(e) If either Holdings LP or AMID shall fail to timely execute and deliver a
Joint Instruction Letter when required under this Agreement, Holdings LP or
AMID, as applicable, shall be entitled to seek an order, judgment or decision
from a court of competent jurisdiction that will enable the Escrow Agent to
release to the applicable Person or Persons the portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Units (together with cash from any distributions paid in respect
thereof) to which they are entitled under this Agreement and to seek to
recover losses and reasonable expenses from Holdings LP or AMID, as
applicable, as a result of such failure to comply with this Agreement.

(f) Any notices required to be delivered to the Escrow Agent by
AMID instructing the Escrow Agent to retain any Indemnity Escrow Units in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be based on AMIDs reasonable estimate, to the
extent known or estimable, of the amount of applicable Damages for which the
AMID Indemnified Parties are claiming to be indemnified under this _Article
VIII_ , which estimate shall not in any way limit the amount of indemnifiable
Damages which the AMID Indemnified Parties may recover hereunder.

 

(g) In the event of a conflict between the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement, this Agreement shall govern as between AMID and Holdings LP. 

Section 8.7 Exclusive Remedy; Waiver of Remedies. Except (a) with respect to
(i) matters covered by  _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_, (ii) any matters
relating to Taxes or (iii) Fraud or (b) as otherwise provided in the
Transaction Documents, each party acknowledges and agrees that, from and after
the Closing (1) the remedies available under _Section 5.5(d)_, _Section
5.6_, _Article VII_ , this _Article VIII_ and _Section 9.7_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the parties for any and all claims relating
(directly or indirectly) to the Transactions, regardless of the legal theory
under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity or otherwise;
and (2) EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IT SHALL NOT SEEK AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, RELEASES, DISCHARGES AND SHALL NOT SUE THE OTHER PARTIES
FOR, AND SHALL CAUSE ALL OTHER OF ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS (EITHER THE
SOUTHCROSS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS OR AMID INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, AS APPLICABLE)
NOT TO SEEK, AND TO WAIVE, RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND NOT SUE THE OTHER PARTIES
INDEMNIFIED PERSONS (EITHER THE SOUTHCROSS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS OR AMID
INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, AS APPLICABLE) FOR, ANY RIGHTS, CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION
TO OR FOR INDEMNIFICATION, CONTRIBUTION, COST RECOVERY OR OTHER REMEDY OR
RECOURSE (WHETHER ON THE BASIS OF A CLAIM SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT, STATUTE,
COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH RESPECT TO OR IN
CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING FROM THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LIABILITIES ARISING

 



69  PURSUANT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS) OUTSIDE OF THE PROVISIONS OF _ARTICLE VII_ ,
_ARTICLE VIII_ , _SECTION 5.5(D)_, _SECTION 5.6_ AND _SECTION 9.7_ OR AS
OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS.

Section 8.8 Waiver of Certain Damages. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS MADE WITH RESPECT TO
FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY (NOR ANY PARTYS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR
THEIR PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, INCORPORATOR,
MEMBER, PARTNER, STOCKHOLDER, AGENT, ATTORNEY OR REPRESENTATIVES) BE LIABLE
FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES BASED ON DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER
BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT,
WITH RESPECT TO SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR
DAMAGES BASED ON DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR LOST PROFITS, SUCH DAMAGES ARE THE
REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF THE RELATED BREACH; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.8 SHALL PREVENT A PARTY FROM RECOVERING ANY
SUCH DAMAGES (INCLUDING FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, PUNITIVE AND EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES) THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY (WHO IS NOT AN AFFILIATE OF A
PARTY) IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED
TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE VIII.

Section 8.9 Right to Bring Claims. The indemnity of each party provided in
this _Article VIII_ shall be for the benefit of and extend to each Person
that is a Southcross Indemnified Person or an AMID Indemnified Person, as
applicable; _provided, however_ , that any claim for indemnity under this
_Article VIII_  by any such Person must be brought and administered by a
party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person other than Holdings LP and the
AMID Entities shall have any rights against either Holdings LP or the AMID
Entities under the terms of this  _Article VIII_ except as may be exercised
on its behalf by the AMID Entities or Holdings LP, as applicable, pursuant to
this _Section 8.9_. Each of Holdings LP and the AMID Entities may elect to
exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this _Section 8.9_ on
behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person
for any action or inaction under this  _Section 8.9_.

Section 8.10 Determination of Amount of Damages. The amount of any Damages for
which indemnification is provided under this _Article VIII_ will be limited
to the Damages actually suffered by the Indemnified Person and will be
computed net of (a) any insurance or other proceeds actually received by the
Indemnified Person in connection with such Damages, net in each case of any
reasonable costs incurred to recover such proceeds (including any related
retrospective premium adjustments resulting from assertion of such claims)
(the net amount of such proceeds, the " _net proceeds_ ") or (b) any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment the Indemnified Person
actually received from any Person with respect to such Damages (less
reasonable costs incurred in obtaining such recovery). Any Indemnified Person
that becomes aware of Damages for which it intends to seek indemnification
hereunder will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, use
commercially reasonable efforts to make and pursue such claims for any
amounts to which it may be entitled under insurance policies or under
indemnification agreements with third parties as are reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying

 



70  Person; provided however that under no circumstances will the Indemnified
Person be required to commence or prosecute any Legal Proceeding with respect
thereto. Under no circumstances shall the possibility of a future insurance
recovery be a basis for reducing the Damages subject to indemnification
hereunder prior to the actual receipt of such recovery, or for limiting,
postponing or delaying satisfaction of any indemnification obligation
hereunder or any Indemnified Persons right to be indemnified, _provided_
that, if any third party recovery or insurance recovery is actually received
by the Indemnified Person after having previously received indemnity claim
proceeds hereunder, such Party will promptly tender to the respective Party an
amount equal to such third party recovery or insurance recovery the amount of
the applicable net proceeds up to the amount of any indemnification
payments theretofore made in respect of such damages. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall any cash disbursed from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
with respect to distributions paid in respect of the Indemnity Escrow Units
reduce the amount of Damages suffered by any Indemnified Person.

(a) EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN _ARTICLE III_
OR IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, HOLDINGS LP MAKES NO OTHER

OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS;

BUSINESS PLAN INFORMATION, AND THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN ATTEMPTING
TO MAKE SUCH PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND OTHER FORECASTS AND PLANS; AND

CONTRARY, NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT ANY PARTYS CLAIMS MADE IN
RESPECT OF FRAUD.

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.1 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Closing, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, only by
written agreement signed on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 9.2 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the Closing,
any party (with respect to itself only) may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in

 



72  the representations and warranties of any other party, (b) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party or
(c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys
conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 9.3 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties except that (a) AMID may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of AMID, (b) no such assignment shall
relieve AMID of any of its obligations hereunder and (c) AMID shall have the
right to assign its rights hereunder to a Financing Source as collateral
security, _provided_ that such assignment is effected only for security
purposes and shall not permit any foreclosure or other execution on such
assignment prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except as set forth in the immediately following sentence, nothing in this
Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement except as set forth in
_Section 5.6_ and  _Article VIII_. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this _Section 9.3_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 9.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each
of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or
email transmission which includes a copy of the sending partys signature(s)
is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

 

Section 9.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights (including third-party
beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the
case of clause (b), the provisions of _Section 5.5(d)_ (Access
Indemnification),  _Section 5.6_ (Indemnification and Insurance), _Section
7.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Article VIII_ (Indemnification), and this
_Section 9.5_ (Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiary).

 



73 Section 9.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in
and to be performed entirely within that State without giving effect to the
choice of law principles of such state that would require or permit the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or
assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.6_, (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties agrees that a judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other many provided by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION OR LEGAL PROCEEDING) ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS, THE FINANCING OR
THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

Section 9.7 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 9.7_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if jurisdiction is
not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of

 



74  Delaware, any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section 9.7_,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that Holdings LP shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause AMID to consummate the Closing if and only if:

(i) all conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to such satisfaction or waiver) have been satisfied or waived;

 

(ii) the Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing in amounts
sufficient for AMID to make the cash payments required to be made pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and _Section 6.3(d);_

(iii) the AMID Entities have failed to consummate the Closing by the date
required pursuant to _Section 1.2_; and

(iv) Holdings LP has confirmed that if specific performance is granted, then
it will take all such actions as are within its control to cause the Closing
to occur.

Section 9.8 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, by facsimile (which is confirmed) or electronic transmission, or

Section 9.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or by future legislative
action to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 



77 Section 9.10 Rules of Construction; Joint Drafting.

 

(a) In construing this Agreement, the following principles will be followed,
in each case unless expressly provided otherwise in a particular instance:
(i) the singular includes the plural and vice versa; (ii) reference to a
Person includes such Persons successors and assigns but, in the case of a
party, only if such successors and assigns are permitted by this
Agreement, and reference to a Person in a particular capacity excludes such
Person in any other capacity; (iii) reference to any gender includes each
other gender; (iv) references to any Exhibit, Schedule, Section, Article,
Annex, subsection and other subdivision refer to the corresponding Exhibits,
Schedules, Sections, Articles, Annexes, subsections and other subdivisions of
this Agreement, unless expressly provided otherwise; (v) references in any
Section, Article or definition to any clause means such clause of such
Section, Article or definition; (vi) "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto," "hereby"
and words of similar import are references to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (vii) the word "or" is not
exclusive, and the word "including" (in its various forms) means "including
without limitation"; (viii) each accounting term not otherwise defined in
this Agreement has the meaning commonly applied to it in accordance with GAAP;
(ix) references to "days" are to calendar days, unless the term "Business
Days" is used; (x) all references to money refer to the lawful currency of
the United States; (xi) references to the "other party" from the perspective
of the AMID Entities, refer to Holdings LP, and from the perspective of
Holdings LP, refer to the AMID Entities; and (xii) any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement with the assistance of counsel and, in the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement or interim drafts of this
Agreement.

Section 9.11 Disclosure Schedules. The Southcross Disclosure Schedules and
the AMID Disclosure Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those
contained in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an
item in one section or subsection of such Southcross Disclosure Schedules or
AMID Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, as an exception to any particular
covenant, representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other covenants, representations or
warranties, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section
or subsection of such Southcross Disclosure Schedules or AMID Disclosure
Schedules with respect to such other covenants, representations or warranties
or an appropriate cross reference thereto, in each case to the extent
relevancy of such disclosure to such other covenants, representations or
warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosed information is applicable thereto. Additionally, for each of the
Southcross Disclosure Schedules or the AMID Disclosure Schedules, the mere
inclusion of an item in such Southcross Disclosure Schedule or AMID Disclosure
Schedules, as applicable, as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and
solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in such Southcross
Disclosure Schedule or AMID Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, that such
information is required to be listed in such Southcross Disclosure Schedule
or AMID Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or that such item (or any non-
disclosed item or

 



78  information of comparable or greater significance) represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance, that such item has had, or is
expected to result in, a Southcross Material Adverse Effect or AMID Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, that such item actually constitutes
noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Law, Permit or contract or other
topic to which such disclosure is applicable or that such item is outside the
Ordinary Course of Business; furthermore, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the mere inclusion of a contract on _Southcross Disclosure
Schedule 3.14(a)_ does not mean that such contract meets, or will meet, the
monetary thresholds set forth in the definition of Holdings Company Material
Contract; provided for avoidance of doubt all contracts included on
_Southcross Disclosure Schedule 3.14(a_ ) shall be deemed Holdings Company
Material Contracts. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in the Southcross Disclosure Schedules or the AMID
Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Southcross Disclosure Schedules or the AMID Disclosure Schedules,
as applicable, in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item, or matter not described herein or included in a
Southcross Disclosure Schedule or AMID Disclosure Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in the
Southcross Disclosure Schedules or the AMID Disclosure Schedules, unless
otherwise defined therein, shall have the meanings assigned to them in this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.12 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any Legal Proceeding based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may
only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney, representative or affiliate of any party or any of their respective
Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement)
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations
or liabilities of such party arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.12_
shall limit any liability of the parties to this Agreement for breaches of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

that it has been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted
with counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.
The covenants, consent and waiver contained in this _Section 9.13_ shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Southcross Law Firm is
entitled whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) Holdings LP (and not the AMID

of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of
the AMID Entities or the Southcross Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii)

whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or

that a dispute arises between any of the AMID Entities or their Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, SXH Holdings and the Contributed
Companies), on the one hand, and a third party other than Holdings LP, on the
other hand, such AMID Entity and its Affiliates (including, following the

its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, SXH Holdings and
the Contributed Companies) may waive such privilege without the prior written

Contributed Companies) is legally required by an order of a Governmental
Authority or otherwise legally required to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by Law,

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINITIONS

Section 1.1  _Definitions_.

The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly
indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.

 



2 "Acquisition" means any transaction in which any Group Member acquires
(through an asset acquisition, merger, stock acquisition or other form of
investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or
business of another Person for the purpose of increasing the long-term
operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership Group from the
operating capacity or operating income of the Partnership Group existing
immediately prior to such transaction.

 

"Additional Book Basis" means the portion of any remaining Carrying Value of
an Adjusted Property that is attributable to positive adjustments made to
such Carrying Value as a result of Book-Up Events. For purposes of determining
the extent that Carrying Value constitutes Additional Book Basis:

 

(a) Any negative adjustment made to the Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property
as a result of either a Book-Down Event or a Book-Up Event shall first be
deemed to offset or decrease that portion of the Carrying Value of such
Adjusted Property that is attributable to any prior positive adjustments made
thereto pursuant to a Book-Up Event or Book-Down Event.

 

(b) If Carrying Value that constitutes Additional Book Basis is reduced as a
result of a Book-Down Event (an "Additional Book Basis Reduction") and the
Carrying Value of other property is increased as a result of such Book-Down
Event (a "Carrying Value Increase"), then any such Carrying Value Increase
shall be treated as Additional Book Basis in an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) the amount of such Carrying Value Increase and (ii) the amount determined
by proportionately allocating to the Carrying Value Increases resulting from
such Book-Down Event by the lesser of (A) the aggregate Additional Book Basis
Reductions resulting from such Book-Down Event and (B) the amount by which the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments after such Book-Down Event
exceeds the remaining Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the
Partnerships Adjusted Property after such Book-Down Event (determined without
regard to the application of this clause (b) to such Book-Down Event).

 

"Additional Book Basis Derivative Items" means any Book Basis Derivative Items
that are computed with reference to Additional Book Basis. To the extent that
the Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the Partnerships Adjusted
Property as of the beginning of any taxable period exceeds the Aggregate
Remaining Net Positive Adjustments as of the beginning of such period (the
"Excess Additional Book Basis"), the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
for such period shall be reduced by the amount that bears the same ratio to
the amount of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items determined without
regard to this sentence as the Excess Additional Book Basis bears to the
Additional Book Basis as of the beginning of such period. With respect to a
Disposed of Adjusted Property, the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
shall be the amount of Additional Book Basis taken into account in computing
gain or loss from the disposition of such Disposed of Adjusted Property;
_provided_ that the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall
apply to the determination of the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items
attributable to Disposed of Adjusted Property.

"Additional Limited Partner" means a Person admitted to the Partnership as a
Limited Partner pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ and who is shown as such on the
books and records of the Partnership.

 



3 "Adjusted Capital Account" means the Capital Account maintained for each
Partner as of the end of each taxable period of the Partnership, (a)
increased by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the
standards set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is
deemed obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2 (i)(5)) and (b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and
deductions that, as of the end of such taxable period, are reasonably expected
to be allocated to such Partner in subsequent taxable periods under Sections
704(e)(2) and 706(d) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)
(ii), and (ii) the amount of all distributions that, as of the end of such
taxable period, are reasonably expected to be made to such Partner in
subsequent taxable periods in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
otherwise to the extent they exceed offsetting increases to such Partners
Capital Account that are reasonably expected to occur during (or prior to)
the taxable period in which such distributions are reasonably expected to be
made (other than increases as a result of a minimum gain chargeback pursuant
to _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_). The foregoing definition
of Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply with the provisions of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith. The "Adjusted Capital Account" of a Partner
in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be the amount that such Adjusted
Capital Account would be if such Partnership Interest were the only interest
in the Partnership held by such Partner from and after the date on which such
Partnership Interest was first issued.

"Adjusted Operating Surplus" means, with respect to any period, (a) Operating
Surplus generated with respect to such period, less (b) (i) any net increase
in Working Capital Borrowings with respect to that period and (ii) any net
decrease in cash reserves for Operating Expenditures with respect to such
period not relating to an Operating Expenditure made with respect to such
period, and plus (c) (i) any net decrease in Working Capital Borrowings with
respect to that period, (ii) any net decrease made in subsequent periods in
cash reserves for Operating Expenditures initially established with respect
to such period to the extent such decrease results in a reduction in Adjusted
Operating Surplus in subsequent periods pursuant to clause (b)(ii) above and
(iii) any net increase in cash reserves for Operating Expenditures with
respect to such period required by any debt instrument for the repayment of
principal, interest or premium. Adjusted Operating Surplus does not include
that portion of Operating Surplus included in clause (a) (i) of the
definition of Operating Surplus.

"Adjusted Property" means any property the Carrying Value of which has been
adjusted pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)_.

"Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly
or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with, the Person in question. As used herein, the term
"control" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Holdings be considered an "Affiliate"
of the General Partner for purposes of this Agreement.

"Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units" has the meaning assigned to
such term in _Section 5.11(a)_.

 



4 "Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments" means, as of the end of
any taxable period, the sum of the Remaining Net Positive Adjustments of all
the Partners.

"Agreed Allocation" means any allocation, other than a Required Allocation,
of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 6.1_, including a Curative Allocation (if appropriate to the context
in which the term "Agreed Allocation" is used).

"Agreed Value" of any Contributed Property means the fair market value of such
property or other consideration at the time of contribution and in the case
of an Adjusted Property, the fair market value of such Adjusted Property on
the date of the Revaluation Event, in both cases as determined by the General
Partner.

 

"Agreement" means this Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of American Midstream Partners, LP, as it may be amended,
supplemented or restated from time to time.

"AIM Midstream" means AIM Midstream Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited

Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an individual) or (B)
another Person (other than an individual) in connection with the merger or
consolidation of the General Partner with or into such other Person or the
transfer by the General Partner of all or substantially all of its assets to
such other Person.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.6(c)_ below, on or after June 30, 2020, the General
Partner may transfer all or any of its General Partner Interest without
Unitholder approval.

 



48 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion
of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees
to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of
the partnership or limited liability company membership interest held by the
General Partner as the general partner or managing member, if any, of each
other Group Member. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance
with this  _Section 4.6_, the transferee or successor (as the case may be)
shall, subject to compliance with the terms of _Section 10.2_, be admitted to
the Partnership as the General Partner effective immediately prior to the
transfer of the General Partner Interest, and the business of the Partnership
shall continue without dissolution.

Section 4.7 _Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights_.

The General Partner or any other holder of Incentive Distribution Rights may
transfer any or all of its Incentive Distribution Rights without Unitholder
approval. Any holder of the HPIP Equity Interest may transfer any or all of
its Incentive Distribution Rights without Unitholder approval. Notwithstanding
anything to herein to the contrary, (i) the transfer of Common Units issued
pursuant to _Section 5.11_ shall not be treated as a transfer of all or any
part of the Incentive Distribution Rights and (ii) no transfer of Incentive
Distribution Rights or HPIP Equity Interests to another Person shall be
permitted unless the transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

Section 4.8 _Restrictions on Transfers_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Article IV_ , no transfer of
any Partnership Interests shall be made if such transfer would (i) terminate
the existence or qualification of the Partnership under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, or (ii) cause the Partnership to be treated as
an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity
for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or
taxed).

(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of
Partnership Interests if it determines, with the advice of counsel, that such
restrictions are necessary or advisable to (i) avoid a significant risk of the
Partnership becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable
as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) preserve the
uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof).
The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment that would result in the delisting
or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests on the
principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner
Interests is then listed or admitted to trading must be approved, prior to
such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.

 



49 (c) The transfer of Common Units that have been issued upon conversion of
Incentive Distribution Rights shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by
_Section 6.8(b)_.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, other than  _Section 4.8(a)_, shall
preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership Interests
entered into through the facilities of any National Securities Exchange on
which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading.

(e) Any transfer of a Series A Conversion Unit, a Series B Conversion Unit, a
Series C Conversion Unit, a Series D Conversion Unit or a Series E Conversion
Unit shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by _Section 6.10_.

Section 4.9  _Eligibility Certifications; Ineligible Holders_.

(a) If at any time the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel,
that 

(i) the U.S. federal income tax status (or lack of proof of the U.S. federal
income tax status) of one or more Limited Partners has or is reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the rates that can be charged to
customers by any Group Member on assets that are subject to regulation by the
FERC or analogous regulatory body (a "Rate Eligibility Trigger"); or

(ii) any Group Member is subject to any federal, state or local law or
regulation that would create a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture
of any property in which the Group Member has an interest based on the
nationality, citizenship or other related status of a Partner (a "Citizenship
Eligibility Trigger");

 

then, the General Partner may adopt such amendments to this Agreement as it
determines to be necessary or advisable to (x) in the case of a
Rate Eligibility Trigger, obtain such proof of the U.S. federal income tax
status of the Limited Partners and, to the extent relevant, their beneficial
owners, as the General Partner determines to be necessary to establish those
Limited Partners whose U.S. federal income tax status does not or would not
have a material adverse effect on the rates that can be charged to customers
by any Group Member or (y) in the case of a Citizenship Eligibility Trigger,
obtain such proof of the nationality, citizenship or other related status of
the Partner (or, if the Partner is a nominee holding for the account of
another Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of such
Person) as the General Partner determines to be necessary to establish those
Partners whose status as Partners does not or would not subject any Group
Member to a significant risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any of its
properties or interests therein.

 

(b) Such amendments may include provisions requiring all Partners to certify
as to their (and their beneficial owners) status as Eligible Holders upon
demand and on a regular basis, as determined by the General Partner, and may
require transferees of Units to so certify prior to being admitted to the
Partnership as a Partner (any such required certificate, an
"Eligibility Certificate").

 



50 (c) Such amendments may provide that any Partner who fails to furnish to the
General Partner within a reasonable period requested proof of its (and its
beneficial owners) status as an Eligible Holder or if upon receipt of such
Eligibility Certificate or other requested information the General Partner
determines that a Partner is not an Eligible Holder (such a Partner an
"Ineligible Holder") the Partnership Interests owned by such Limited Partner
shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of _Section
4.10_. In addition, the General Partner shall be substituted for all Limited
Partners that are Ineligible Holders as the Limited Partner in respect of the
Ineligible Holders Partnership Interests.

 

(d) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of
Partnership Interests held by it on behalf of Ineligible Holders, distribute
the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Partners (including the General
Partner and its Affiliates) in respect of Partnership Interests other than
those of Ineligible Holders are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to
the matter.

(e) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Holder shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to  _Section 12.4_ but
shall be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall
provide cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible Holders share of
any distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Ineligible
Holder of his Partnership Interest (representing his right to receive his
share of such distribution in kind).

 

(f) At any time after an Ineligible Holder can and does certify that he has
become an Eligible Holder, an Ineligible Holder may, upon application to the
General Partner, request that with respect to any Partnership Interests of
such Ineligible Holder not redeemed pursuant to _Section 4.10_, such
Ineligible Holder be admitted as a Limited Partner, and upon approval of
the General Partner, such Ineligible Holder shall be admitted as a Limited
Partner and shall no longer constitute an Ineligible Holder and the General
Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of such
Ineligible Holders Partnership Interests.

Section 4.10 _Redemption of Partnership Interests of Ineligible Holders_.

 

(a) If at any time a Partner fails to furnish an Eligibility Certificate or
other information requested within the period of time specified in amendments
adopted pursuant to _Section 4.9_, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility
Certificate or other information the General Partner determines, with the
advice of counsel, that a Partner is not an Eligible Holder, the
Partnership may, unless the Partner establishes to the satisfaction of the
General Partner that such Partner is an Eligible Holder or has transferred his
Partnership Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Holder and who furnishes
an Eligibility Certificate to the General Partner prior to the date fixed for
redemption as provided below, redeem the Partnership Interest of such Partner
as follows:

 

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Partner, at his last
address designated on the records of the Partnership or the Transfer Agent, by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to
have been given when so mailed. The notice shall specify the Redeemable
Interests, the date fixed for redemption,

 



51  the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon
redemption of the Redeemable Interests (or, if later in the case of Redeemable
Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificates
evidencing the Redeemable Interests) and that on and after the date fixed for
redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the Partner would
otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or
be made.

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Partnership Interests of the class
to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Partnership Interests of each
such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption price
shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of
a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption
price, bearing interest at the rate of 5% annually and payable in three equal
annual installments of principal together with accrued interest, commencing
one year after the redemption date.

 

(iii) The Partner or his duly authorized representative shall be entitled to
receive the payment for the Redeemable Interests at the place of payment
specified in the notice of redemption on the redemption date (or, if later in
the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender by
or on behalf of the Partner at the place specified in the notice
of redemption, of the Certificates evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank).

 

(iv) the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute
issued and Outstanding Partnership Interests.

 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 4.10_ shall also be applicable to
Partnership Interests held by a Partner as nominee of a Person determined to
be an Ineligible Holder.

(c) Nothing in this _Section 4.10_ shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Partnership Interest before the redemption
date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Upon
receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the
notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Partnership Interest
certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that he is an Eligible
Holder. If the transferee fails to make such certification, such redemption
shall be effected from the transferee on the original redemption date.

 



52 ARTICLE V

 

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND

 

ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

 

Section 5.1 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

Section 5.2 _Contributions by the General Partner and the Initial Limited
Partners_.

 

Upon the issuance of any additional Limited Partner Interests by the
Partnership (other than Common Units issued pursuant to  _Section 5.11_),
the General Partner may, in order to maintain its Percentage Interest, make
additional Capital Contributions in an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the General Partners
Percentage Interest immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional
Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership by (B) 100 less the General
Partners Percentage Interest immediately prior to the issuance of such
Additional Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership times (ii) the amount
contributed to the Partnership by the Limited Partners in exchange for such
Additional Limited Partner Interests. Except as set forth in _Article XII_ ,
the General Partner shall not be obligated to make any additional Capital
Contributions to the Partnership.

Section 5.3  _Contributions by Limited Partners_.

No Limited Partner will be required to make any Capital Contribution to the
Partnership pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Interest and Withdrawal of Capital Contributions_.

 

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No
Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its
Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made
pursuant to this Agreement or upon liquidation of the Partnership may be
considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this
Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no
Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either as to the return of
Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any such
return shall be a compromise to which all Partners agree within the meaning
of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

Section 5.5 _Capital Accounts_.

 

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of
Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has
furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with
Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General
Partner) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect
to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Such Capital Account shall be increased
by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with
respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income
and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance
with _Section 5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest
pursuant to  _Section 6.1_ (or otherwise in accordance with _Article V_ ),
and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and
deemed distributions of cash or property (other than Series A PIK Preferred
Units, Series B PIK Units, Series C PIK Preferred Units or Series E PIK
Preferred Units) made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all
items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with _Section
5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ (or otherwise in accordance with _Article V_ ). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Series A Preferred Units, the Series B Units, the
Series C Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred
Units will be treated as a partnership interest in the Partnership that is
"convertible equity"

 



53  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.721-2(g)(3), and,
therefore, each holder of a Series A Preferred Unit, Series B Unit, Series C
Preferred Unit, Series D Preferred Units or Series E Preferred Unit will be
treated as a partner in the Partnership, other than with respect to the
conversion feature of the Series A Preferred Unit, Series B Unit, Series C
Preferred Unit, Series D Preferred Unit or Series E Preferred Unit. The
initial Capital Account balance in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit
issued on the Series A Issuance Date shall be the Series A Issue Price, and
the initial Capital Account balance in respect of each Series A PIK Preferred
Unit shall be zero. After an issuance of Series A PIK Preferred Units
pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(ii)_, the Capital Accounts of all Series A
Preferred Units that are Outstanding prior to such issuance shall be divided
equally among all Series A Preferred Units that are Outstanding after such
issuance. The Capital Account balance of each holder of Series A Preferred
Units in respect of its Series A Preferred Units shall not be increased or
decreased as a result of the accrual and accumulation of an unpaid
distribution pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A)_ or _Section
5.12(b)(ii)(B)_ in respect of such Series A Preferred Units except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. The initial Capital Account balance in
respect of each Series B Unit (including each Series B PIK Unit) shall be the
Series B Issue Price. The initial Capital Account balance in respect of each
Series C Preferred Unit issued on the Series C Issuance Date shall be the
Series C Issue Price, and the initial Capital Account balance in respect of
each Series C PIK Preferred Unit shall be zero. After an issuance of Series C
PIK Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(ii)_, the Capital Accounts
of all Series C Preferred Units that are Outstanding prior to such issuance
shall be divided equally among all Series C Preferred Units that are
Outstanding after such issuance. The Capital Account balance of each holder of
Series C Preferred Units in respect of its Series C Preferred Units shall not
be increased or decreased as a result of the accrual and accumulation of an
unpaid distribution pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(ii)(A)_ or _Section
5.14(b)(ii)(B)_ in respect of such Series C Preferred Units except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. The initial Capital Account balance in
respect of each Series D Preferred Unit issued on the Series D Issuance Date
shall be the Series D Issue Price. The Capital Account balance of each holder
of Series D Preferred Units in respect of its Series D Preferred Units shall
not be increased or decreased as a result of the accrual and accumulation of
an unpaid distribution pursuant to _Section 5.15(b)(ii)(A)_ or  _Section
5.15(b)(ii)(B)_ in respect of such Series D Preferred Units except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. The initial Capital Account balance in
respect of each Series E Preferred Unit issued on the Series E Issuance Date
shall be the Series E Issue Price, and the initial Capital Account balance in
respect of each Series E PIK Preferred Unit shall be zero. After an issuance
of Series E PIK Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(ii)_, the
Capital Accounts of all Series E Preferred Units that are Outstanding prior
to such issuance shall be divided equally among all Series E Preferred Units
that are Outstanding after such issuance. The Capital Account balance of each
holder of Series E Preferred Units in respect of its Series E Preferred Units
shall not be increased or decreased as a result of the accrual and
accumulation of an unpaid distribution pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(ii)(A)_
or _Section 5.16(b)(ii)(B)_ in respect of such Series E Preferred Units
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction that is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be
reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its
determination, recognition and classification for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for that purpose), _provided_ , that:

 



54 (i) Solely for purposes of this _Section 5.5_, the Partnership shall
be treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the
General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member
Agreement) of all property owned by (x) any other Group Member that is
classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (y) any
other partnership, limited liability company, unincorporated business or other
entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes of
which a Group Member is, directly or indirectly, a partner, member or other
equity holder.

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code that may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described
in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the
fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To
the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset
pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1 (b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account
in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.

 

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 

(v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to
any Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to  _Section
5.5(d)_ to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property
shall be determined, under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-3(d)(2), as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to
the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment.

 



55 (vi) The Gross Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7 (b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such
times as provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The
amount of any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item
of loss (if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such Liability of
the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the Carrying
Value of such Liability of the Partnership).

 

(c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a Pro Rata portion
of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest
so transferred.

(i) Reserved.

 

(ii) Upon the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units pursuant to _Section
5.11(a)_, the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Incentive
Distribution Rights shall (A) first, be allocated to IDR Reset Common Units in
an amount equal to the product of (x) the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset
Common Units and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an IPO Common Unit, and
(B) second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by
the holder of the Incentive Distributions Rights. In the event that there is
not a sufficient Capital Account associated with the Incentive Distribution
Rights to allocate the full Per Unit Capital Amount for an IPO Common Unit to
the IDR Reset Common Units in accordance with clause (A) of this _Section
5.5(c)(ii)_, the IDR Reset Common Units shall be subject to  _Section
6.1(d)(x)(B)_ and _Section 6.1(d)(x)(C)_.

(iii) Subject to _Section 6.11_, immediately prior to the transfer of an
Option Unit by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate of the
assignor unless the General Partner elects to have this _Section 5.5(c)(iii)_
apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its
transferred Option Units will (A) first, be allocated to the Option Units in
an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Option Units to be
transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B)
second, any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the
transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any Option Units. Following
any such allocation, the transferors Capital Account, if any, maintained
with respect to the retained Option Units, if any, will have a balance equal
to the amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the transferees
Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Option Units will
have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (A) hereinabove.

(iv) Immediately prior to the transfer of a Post-Initial Issuance Series B
Unit by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to an Affiliate unless the
General Partner elects to have this _Section 5.5(c)(iv)_ apply), the
aggregate Capital Account maintained for such Person with respect to its
Post-Initial Issuance Series B Units will (A) first, be allocated to the Post-
Initial Issuance Series B Units to be transferred in an amount equal to the
product of (x) the number of such Post-Initial Issuance Series B Units to be
transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit that is not
a Post-Initial Issuance Series B Unit, and (B) second, any remaining positive
balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor,
regardless of whether it has retained

 



56  any Post-Initial Issuance Series B Units and if the remaining balance would
be negative, items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated
to such transferor Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate
the deficit in its Capital Account as quickly as possible. Following any such
allocation, the transferors Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect
to the retained Post-Initial Issuance Series B Units, if any, will have a
balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) above, and the
transferees Capital Account established with respect to the transferred Post-
Initial Issuance Series B Units will have a balance equal to the
amount allocated under clause (A) above.

(d)

 

(i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), and
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(b)(2) on (A) an issuance of additional Partnership
Interests for cash or other property (other than an issuance of Series A PIK
Preferred Units, Series B PIK Units, Series C PIK Preferred Units or Series E
PIK Preferred Units), (B) the issuance of additional Partnership Interests as
consideration for the provision of services, (C) the issuance by the
Partnership of a "noncompensatory option" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.721-2(f) and 1.761-3(b)(2) which is not treated as a
partnership interest pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.761-3(a)
(other than an issuance of Series A PIK Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.12(b)(ii)_, the issuance of Series B PIK Units pursuant to  _Section
5.13(d)_, the issuance of Series C PIK Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.14(b)(ii) _or the issuance of Series E PIK Preferred Units pursuant to
_Section 5.16(b)(ii)_), or (D) the conversion of a General Partners
Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to _Section 11.3(b)_, the Capital
Account of each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property
shall be adjusted immediately prior to such event to reflect any Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of
each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value
immediately prior to such event and had been allocated pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)_ and _Section 6.1(d)_ (and to the extent applicable, _Article V_ ) in
the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an
event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been
allocated; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of the issuance of a
Partnership Interest pursuant to the exercise of a Noncompensatory Option
where the right to share in Partnership capital represented by such
Partnership Interest differs from the consideration paid to acquire and
exercise such option, the Carrying Value of each Partnership property
immediately after the issuance of such Partnership Interest shall be adjusted
upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property and the Capital Accounts of the
Partners shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); provided further, that in the event
of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of cash or
Contributed Property, in the event of an issuance of a Noncompensatory Option
to acquire a de minimis Partnership Interest or in the event of an issuance
of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for the
provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such adjustments
are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership. The General
Partner shall adjust such Carrying Values in respect of the contributions that
are

 



57  made on the Closing Date. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership
assets immediately prior to such event (or, in the case of a Revaluation
Event resulting from the exercise of a Noncompensatory Option, immediately
after the issuance of the Partnership Interest acquired pursuant to the
exercise of such Noncompensatory Option) shall be determined by the
General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt
(taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into
account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at
such time and must make such adjustments to such valuation as required by
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1 (b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). The General Partner
shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership in
such manner as it determines in its discretion to be reasonable. Absent a
contrary determination by the General Partner, the aggregate fair market value
of all Partnership property (including, without limitation, cash or cash
equivalents) immediately prior to a Revaluation Event shall be the value that
would result in the Capital Account for each Common Unit that is Outstanding
prior to such Revaluation Event being equal to the Event Issue Value. 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately
prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and
had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 6.1(c)
and Section 6.1(d) (and to the extent applicable, _Article V_ ) in the same
manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event
giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated.
In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual
distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a
deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that
provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution
pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using
such method of valuation as it may adopt.

 

(iii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s),
immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit, Series B Unit,
Series C Preferred Unit, Series D Preferred Unit or Series E Preferred Unit
into Common Units in accordance with _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_, _Section
5.13(c)_, _Section 5.14(b)(viii)_,  _Section 5.15(b)(viii)_ or _Section
5.16(b)(viii)_, as applicable, or upon the exercise of any other
Noncompensatory Option into a Common Unit pursuant to this Agreement, the
Capital Account of each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership
property shall be adjusted to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss

 



58  had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount
equal to its fair market value immediately after such conversion and (A)
first, all Unrealized Gain (if the Capital Account of each such Converted or
Exercised Unit is less than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding
IPO Common Unit) or Unrealized Loss (if the Capital Account of each such
Converted or Exercised Unit is greater than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
then Outstanding IPO Common Unit) had been allocated Pro Rata to each Partner
holding any Converted or Exercised Unit received upon such conversion until
the Capital Account of each such Converted or Exercised Unit is equal to the
Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding IPO Common Unit; and (B)
second, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been allocated to
the Partners at such time pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_ and  _Section
6.1(d)_ (and to the extent applicable, _Article V_ ). In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market
value of all Partnership assets immediately after the conversion of
a Converted or Exercised Unit shall be determined by the General Partner
using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt (taking into account
Section 7701(g) of the Code); _provided_ , _however_ , that the General
Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair
market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and
must make such adjustments to such valuation as required by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). The General Partner shall
allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership in such
manner as it determines in its discretion to be reasonable. If, after making
the allocations of Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss as set forth above in
this _Section 5.5(d)(iii)_, the Capital Account of each Partner with respect
to each Converted or Exercised Unit received upon such conversion of the
Series A Preferred Unit, Series B Unit, Series C Preferred Unit, Series D
Preferred Unit, Series E Preferred Unit or other Noncompensatory Option, as
applicable, is less than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding
IPO Common Unit, then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between
the Partners holding Common Units (other than Converted or Exercised Units)
and Partners holding any Converted or Exercised Unit so as to cause the
Capital Account of each Partner holding a Converted or Exercised Unit to
equal, on a per Unit basis with respect to each such Converted or Exercised
Unit, the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding IPO Common Unit.

 

Section 5.6 _Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests_.

 

(a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Interests and options,
rights, warrants, appreciation rights, tracking and phantom interests, and
other economic interests relating to the Partnership Interests (including
pursuant to _Section 7.4(c)_) for any partnership purpose at any time and
from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such
terms and conditions as the General Partner shall determine, all without the
approval of any Limited Partners.

(b) Each additional Partnership Interest or other security authorized to be
issued by the Partnership pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ or _Section 7.4(c)_
may be issued in one or more classes, or one or more series of any such
classes, with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties
(which may be senior to existing classes and series of Partnership Interests
or other securities), as shall be fixed by the General Partner, including (i)
the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or items thereof; (ii)
the right to share in Partnership

 



59  distributions; (iii) the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the
Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the
Partnership may or shall be required to redeem the Partnership Interest
(including sinking fund provisions) or other security; (v) whether such
Partnership Interest or other security is issued with the privilege of
conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of
such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each
Partnership Interest or other security will be issued, evidenced by
certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining the
Percentage Interest as to such Partnership Interest; and (viii) the right, if
any, of each such Partnership Interest to vote on Partnership matters,
including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges
of such Partnership Interest.

 

(c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership
Interests and options, rights, warrants, appreciation rights, tracking and
phantom interests, and other economic interests in the Partnership or relating
to Partnership Interests pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ or  _Section
7.4(c)_, (ii) the conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, (iii) the issuance of Common Units pursuant to
_Section 5.11_, (iv) the admission of Additional Limited Partners and (v)
all additional issuances of Partnership Interests. The General Partner shall
determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units
or other Partnership Interests or other securities being so issued. The
General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act
and is authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of
Partnership Interests or other securities or in connection with the
conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or
guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National
Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Interests are
listed or admitted to trading.

 

(d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership.

 

Section 5.7 _Reserved_.

 

Section 5.8 _Limited Preemptive Rights_.

 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 5.8_ and in _Section 5.2_ or as
otherwise provided in a separate agreement by the Partnership, no Person
shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to
the issuance of any Partnership Interest or other security, whether unissued,
held in the treasury or hereafter created. The General Partner shall have the
right, that it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its
Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Interests from the Partnership whenever,
and on the same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to
Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, to the extent
necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its
Affiliates equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of
such Partnership Interests. Any determination by the General Partner whether
to exercise its right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be
a determination made in its individual capacity and not as the general partner
of the Partnership, and such determination may be made in accordance with
_Section 7.9(c)_.

 



60 (b) If a Class D Member or any of its Affiliates holds any Limited Partner
Interests while the Partnership issues Limited Partner Interests of the same
class as such Limited Partner Interests (other than (i) Series A PIK Preferred
Units, Series B PIK Units, Series C PIK Preferred Units or Series E PIK
Preferred Units or (ii) Limited Partner Interests purchased by the General
Partner pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.8(a)_) to the Class A Member
or any of its Affiliates, such Class D Member shall have the right to purchase
Limited Partner Interests of such class from the Partnership up to the amount
necessary to maintain the aggregate Percentage Interest of such Class D Member
and its Affiliates equal to that which existed immediately prior to the
issuance of such Limited Partner Interests on the same terms provided to the
Class A Member or its Affiliates. The Partnership shall give prompt written
notice of the Partnerships proposal to issue Limited Partner Interests (other
than (i) Series A PIK Preferred Units, Series B PIK Units, Series C PIK
Preferred Units or Series E PIK Preferred Units or (ii) Limited Partner
Interests purchased by the General Partner pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or
_5.8(a)_ ) to the Class A Member or any of its Affiliates to each Class D
Member. Such written notice shall set forth (A) the Limited Partner Interests
being offered, (B) the price and terms, if any, upon which the Partnership
proposes to issue such Limited Partner Interests and (C) the proposed date of
the closing of the issuance of such Limited Partner Interests. Each Class D
Member shall have ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice to
submit a written notice (a "Class D Exercise Notice") to the Partnership. The
Class D Exercise Notice shall set forth the portion of the Limited Partner
Interests that such Class D Member elects to purchase.

 

(c) If the Partnership issues Limited Partner Interests (other than (i) Series
A PIK Preferred Units, Series B PIK Units, Series C PIK Preferred Units
Series C Conversion Units or Series D Conversion Units, (ii) Limited Partner
Interests purchased by the General Partner pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or
_Section 5.8(a)_, (iii) Limited Partner Interests issued to finance all or a
portion of the construction, acquisition, development or improvement of a
Capital Improvement or replacement of a capital asset (such as equipment or
facilities), or (iv) Limited Partner Interests issued on a pro rata basis to
all holders of Common Units) to the Series C Preferred Unit Partner, Series D
Preferred Unit Partner or any of their Affiliates, the Series E Preferred Unit
Partner shall have the right to purchase such Limited Partner Interests from
the Partnership up to the amount necessary to maintain the Percentage
Interest of the Series E Preferred Unit Partner equal to that which existed
immediately prior to the issuance of such Limited Partner Interests on the
same terms provided to the Series C Preferred Unit Partner, Series D
Preferred Unit Partner or any of their Affiliates. The Partnership shall give
prompt written notice of the Partnerships proposal to issue Limited Partner
Interests (other than (i) Series A PIK Preferred Units, Series B PIK Units,
Series C PIK Preferred Units, Series C Conversion Units or Series D Conversion
Units, (ii) Limited Partner Interests purchased by the General Partner
pursuant to _Section 5.2_ or  _Section 5.8(a)_, or (iii) Limited Partner
Interests issued to finance all or a portion of the construction, acquisition,
development or improvement of a Capital Improvement or replacement of a
capital asset (such as equipment or facilities) or (iv) Limited Partner
Interests issued on a pro rata basis to all holders of Common Units) to the
Series C Preferred Unit Partner, Series D Preferred Unit Partner or any of
their Affiliates, to the Series E Preferred Unit Partner. Such written notice
shall set forth (A) the Limited Partner Interests being offered, (B) the price
and terms, if any, upon which the Partnership proposes to issue such Limited
Partner Interests and (C) the proposed date of the closing of the issuance of
such Limited Partner Interests. The Series E Preferred Unit Partner shall have
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice to submit a written notice
(a "Series E Exercise Notice") to the Partnership. The Series E Exercise
Notice shall set forth the portion of the Limited Partner Interests that such
Series E Preferred Unit Partner elects to purchase.

 



61 Section 5.9 _Splits and Combinations_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.9(d)_, _Section 6.6_ and _Section 6.9_ (dealing
with adjustments of distribution levels), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata
distribution of Partnership Interests to all Record Holders or may effect a
subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests so long as, after any such
event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the
Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per-Unit
basis (including any Common Unit Arrearage or Cumulative Common Unit
Arrearage) or stated as a number of Units (including the number of
Common Units into which Series A Preferred Units, Series B Units, Series C
Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units or Series E Preferred Units may be
converted into) are proportionately adjusted.

 

(b) Whenever such a Pro Rata distribution, subdivision or combination of
Partnership Interests is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record
Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be
effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record
Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the
date of such notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent
public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership
Interests to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such
distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be
entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive
evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.

 

(c) If a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests, or a subdivision or
combination of Partnership Interests, is made as contemplated in this
_Section 5.9_, the number of Notional General Partner Units constituting the
Percentage Interest of the General Partner (as determined immediately prior to
the Record Date for such distribution, subdivision or combination) shall
be appropriately adjusted as of the effective date for payment of such
distribution, subdivision or combination to maintain such Percentage Interest
of the General Partner.

 

(d) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Partnership Interests to
the Record Holders of Partnership Interests as of the applicable Record Date
representing the new number of Partnership Interests held by such Record
Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it
determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes. If any
such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Interests
Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to
a Record Holder of such new Certificate or uncertificated Partnership
Interests, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder
immediately prior to such Record Date.

 

(e) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units or Notional General
Partner Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units. If
a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the
issuance of fractional Units or fractional Notional General Partner Units but
for the provisions of this _Section 5.9(e)_, each fractional Unit or
fractional Notional General Partner Unit shall be rounded to the nearest
whole Unit or Notional General Partner Unit (and a 0.5 Unit or Notional
General Partner Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit or Notional
General Partner Unit).

 



62 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, upon any Pro Rata distribution of Partnership
Interests to all Record Holders of Common Units or any subdivision or
combination (or reclassification into a greater or smaller number) of Common
Units, the Partnership will proportionately adjust the number of Series B
Units as follows: (i) if the Partnership issues Partnership Interests as a
distribution on its Common Units or subdivides the Common Units (or
reclassifies them into a greater number of Common Units), then the Series B
Units shall be subdivided into a number of Series B Units equal to the result
of multiplying the number of Series B Units by a fraction, (A) the numerator
of which shall be the sum of the number of Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to such distribution or subdivision plus the total number of
Partnership Interests constituting such distribution or newly created by such
subdivision, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of Common
Units outstanding immediately prior to such distribution or subdivision, and
(ii) if the Partnership combines the Common Units (or reclassifies them into
a smaller number of Common Units), then the Series B Units shall be combined
into a number of Series B Units equal to the result of multiplying the number
of Series B Units by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum
of the number of Common Units outstanding immediately following such
combination, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of Common
Units outstanding immediately prior to such combination.

Section 5.10 _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests_.

 

All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the
requirements of, this _Article V_ shall be fully paid and non-assessable
Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability
may be affected by either or both of Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of the
Delaware Act.

 

Section 5.11 _Issuance of Common Units in Connection with Reset of Incentive
Distribution Rights_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.11_, the holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the
Incentive Distribution Rights) shall have the right, exercisable at its option
at any time when the Partnership has made a distribution on its Common
Units exceeding the Target Distribution for each of the four most recently
completed Quarters and the amount of each such distribution did not exceed
Adjusted Operating Surplus for such Quarter, to make an election (the "IDR
Reset Election") to cause the Minimum Quarterly Distribution to be reset in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.11(e)_ and, in connection
therewith, the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will
become entitled to receive their respective proportionate share of a number
of Common Units (the "IDR Reset Common Units") derived by dividing (i) the
average aggregate amount of cash distributions made by the Partnership for the
two full Quarters immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice (as
defined in _Section 5.11 (b)_) in respect of the Incentive Distribution
Rights by (ii) the average of the cash distributions made by the Partnership
in respect of each Common Unit for

 



63  the two full Quarters immediately preceding the giving of the Reset Notice
(the number of Common Units determined by such quotient is referred to herein
as the "Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units"). If at the time of any
IDR Reset Election the General Partner and its Affiliates are not the holders
of a majority interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights, then the IDR
Reset Election shall be subject to the prior written concurrence of the
General Partner that the conditions described in the immediately preceding
sentence have been satisfied. The Percentage Interest of the General Partner,
with respect to the General Partner Interest, after the issuance of the
Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units shall equal the Percentage
Interest of the General Partner, with respect to the General Partner Interest,
prior to the issuance of the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and
the General Partner shall not be obligated to make any additional Capital
Contribution to the Partnership in order to maintain its Percentage Interest
in connection therewith and shall be issued an additional number of Notional
General Partner Units as is required to maintain such Percentage Interest.
The making of the IDR Reset Election in the manner specified in _Section
5.11(b)_ shall cause the Minimum Quarterly Distribution to be reset in
accordance with the provisions of  _Section 5.11(e)_ and, in connection
therewith, the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will
become entitled to receive IDR Reset Common Units on the basis specified
above, without any further approval required by the General Partner or the
Unitholders, at the time specified in _Section 5.11(c)_ unless the IDR Reset
Election is rescinded pursuant to _Section 5.11(d)_.

 

(b) To exercise the right specified in _Section 5.11(a)_, the holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the
Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the
Incentive Distribution Rights) shall deliver a written notice (the "Reset
Notice") to the Partnership. Within 10 Business Days after the receipt by the
Partnership of such Reset Notice, the Partnership shall deliver a written
notice to the holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights of the
Partnerships determination of the aggregate number of IDR Reset Common
Units that each holder of Incentive Distribution Rights will be entitled to
receive.

(c) The holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights will be
entitled to receive the Aggregate Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units on the
fifteenth Business Day after receipt by the Partnership of the Reset Notice;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the issuance of IDR Reset Common Units to the
holder or holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights shall not occur prior
to the approval of the listing or admission for trading of such IDR Reset
Common Units by the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the
Common Units are then listed or admitted for trading if any such approval is
required pursuant to the rules and regulations of such National Securities
Exchange.

 

(d) If the principal National Securities Exchange upon which the Common Units
are then traded has not approved the listing or admission for trading of the
Common Units to be issued pursuant to this _Section 5.11_ on or before the
30th calendar day following the Partnerships receipt of the Reset Notice and
such approval is required by the rules and regulations of such National
Securities Exchange, then the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights (or,
if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the
holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution Rights) shall
have the right to either rescind the IDR Reset Election or elect to receive
other Partnership Interests having such terms as the General Partner may
approve, with the approval of a Conflicts Committee, that will provide (i)

 



64  the same economic value, in the aggregate, as the Aggregate Quantity of IDR
Reset Common Units would have had at the time of the Partnerships receipt of
the Reset Notice, as determined by the General Partner, and (ii) for the
subsequent conversion (on terms acceptable to the National Securities Exchange
upon which the Common Units are then traded) of such Partnership Interests
into Common Units within not more than 12 months following the Partnerships
receipt of the Reset Notice upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions
that are reasonably acceptable to the holder of the Incentive Distribution
Rights (or, if there is more than one holder of the Incentive Distribution
Rights, the holders of a majority in interest of the Incentive Distribution
Rights).

(e) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be increased at the time of the
issuance of Common Units or other Partnership Interests pursuant to this
_Section 5.11_ such that the Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be reset to
equal the average cash distribution amount per Common Unit for the two
Quarters immediately prior to the Partnerships receipt of the Reset Notice.

Section 5.12  _Establishment of Series A Preferred Units_.

(a) _General_. The Partnership hereby designates and creates a series of Units
to be designated as "Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Units" and consisting
of a total of 5,142,857 Series A-1 Preferred Units, and a series of Units to
be designated as "Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units" and consisting of a
total of 2,571,429 Series A-2 Preferred Units, plus any additional Series A-1
Preferred Units and Series A-2 Preferred Units issued in kind as a
distribution pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(ii)_ ("Series A PIK Preferred
Units"), having the same rights, preferences and privileges, and subject to
the same duties and obligations, as the Common Units, except as set forth in
this _Section 5.12_ and in _Section 5.5(d)(i)_,  _Section 6.10_, and
_Section 12.9_. Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Units shall be issued as
Series A PIK Preferred Units with respect to Series A-1 Convertible Preferred
Units. Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units shall be issued as Series A PIK
Preferred Units with respect to Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units. As of
March 30, 2015, all units previously issued as "Series A Convertible Preferred
Units" shall be "Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Units." The Series A-1
Convertible Preferred Units and Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units,
whether issued on a Series A Issuance Date or as Series A PIK Preferred Units,
are referred to herein as "Series A Preferred Units" and as such the Series
A-1 Convertible Preferred Units and the Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units
shall be considered pari passu as to allocations and distributions with each
other and with the Series C Convertible Preferred Units, Series D Preferred
Units and the Series E Preferred Units. As of April 21, 2016, 9,499,370 Series
A Preferred Units had been issued. Other than with respect to Series A PIK
Preferred Units, immediately following the Series A Issuance Date and
thereafter, no additional Series A Preferred Units shall be designated,
created or issued without the prior written approval of the General Partner
and the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units.

(A) Commencing with the Quarter ending on June 30, 2013, the holders of the
Series A Preferred Units Outstanding as of an applicable Record Date shall be
entitled to receive cumulative distributions (each, a "Series A Quarterly
Distribution"), prior to any other distributions made in respect of any Junior
Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, in the amount set
forth in this _Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A)_ in respect of each Outstanding Series
A Preferred Unit. All such distributions shall be paid Quarterly within forty-
five (45) days after the end of each Quarter (each such payment date, a
"Series A Distribution Payment Date"). For the Quarter ending June 30, 2013,
and for each Quarter thereafter through and including the Quarter ending March
31, 2014, the Series A Quarterly Distribution on each Outstanding Series A
Preferred Unit shall be paid as follows: (i) a number of Series A PIK
Preferred Units equal to the Series A PIK Payment Amount and (ii) $0.25 in
cash (provided that for the Quarter in which the Series A Issuance Date
occurs, the amount payable pursuant to this clause (ii) shall be an amount in
cash equal to the product of (I) $0.25 times (II) a fraction, of which the
numerator is the number of days from and including the Series A Issuance Date
to but excluding the date of such Quarters end, and the denominator is 91).
For the Quarter ending June 30, 2014, and for each Quarter thereafter through

the Merger is consummated, the Series A Quarterly Distribution on each
Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit shall be paid in a number of Series A PIK
Preferred Units equal to the Series A Second PIK Payment Amount; provided
that, in the discretion of the General Partner, which determination shall be
made prior to the Record Date for the relevant quarter, the Series A Quarterly
Distribution may be paid as (x) an amount in cash up to the greater of (a)
$0.50 and (b) the Series A Distribution Amount, and (y) a number of Series A
PIK Preferred Units equal to (a) the remainder of (i) the greater of (I) $0.50
and (II) the Series A Distribution Amount less (ii) the amount of cash paid
pursuant to clause (x), divided by (b) the Series A Adjusted Issue Price. For
the Quarter in which the Merger is consummated and each Quarter thereafter,
the Series A Quarterly Distribution on each Outstanding Series A Preferred
Unit shall be paid in a number of Series A PIK Preferred Units equal to the
Series A Third PIK Payment Amount; provided that, in the discretion of the
General Partner, which determination shall be made prior to the Record Date

(x) an amount in cash up to the greater of (a) $0.4125 and (b) the Series A
Distribution Amount, and (y) a number of Series A PIK Preferred Units equal to
the quotient of (a) the remainder of (i) the greater of (I) $0.4125 and (II)
the Series A Distribution Amount less (ii) the amount of cash

 



67  paid pursuant to clause (x), divided by (b) the Series A Adjusted Issue
Price. If the Partnership establishes a Record Date for any distribution to be
made by the Partnership on other Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section
6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, then the Record Date established pursuant to this
_Section 5.12(b)(ii)_ for a Series A Quarterly Distribution in respect of any
Quarter shall be the same Record Date established for any distribution to be
made by the Partnership in respect of distributions on other Partnership
Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_ for such Quarter.
Unless otherwise expressly  _provided_ , references in this Agreement to
Series A Preferred Units shall include all Series A PIK Preferred Units
Outstanding as of the date of such determination.

 

(B) When any Series A PIK Preferred Units are payable to a Record Holder of
Series A Preferred Units pursuant to this  _Section 5.12_, the Partnership
shall issue the Series A PIK Preferred Units to such Record Holder no later
than the Series A Distribution Payment Date (the date of issuance of such
Series A PIK Preferred Units, the "Series A PIK Preferred Payment Date"). On
the Series A PIK Preferred Payment Date, the Partnership shall issue to such
Series A Unitholder a Certificate or Certificates for the number of Series A
PIK Preferred Units to which such Series A Unitholder shall be entitled. The
issuance of the Series A PIK Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)(ii)_ shall be deemed to have been made on the first day of the Quarter
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment of Series A PIK
Preferred Units was due. If, in violation of this Agreement, the Partnership
fails to pay in full or part any Series A Quarterly Distribution in kind when
due, then the holders entitled to the unpaid Series A PIK Preferred Units
shall be entitled (I) to receive Series A Quarterly Distributions in
subsequent Quarters in respect of such unpaid Series A PIK Preferred Units,
(II) to receive the Series A Liquidation Value in accordance with _Section
5.12(b)(iv)_ in respect of such unpaid Series A PIK Preferred Units, and
(III) to all other rights under this Agreement as if such unpaid Series A PIK
Preferred Units had in fact been distributed on the date due. Nothing in this
_Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B)_ shall alter the obligation of the Partnership to
pay any unpaid Series A PIK Preferred Units or the right of the holders of
Series A Preferred Units to enforce this Agreement to compel the Partnership
to distribute any unpaid Series A PIK Preferred Units. Fractional Series A
PIK Preferred Units shall not be issued to any person (each fractional Series
A PIK Preferred Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Series A PIK
Preferred Unit (and a 0.5 Series A PIK Preferred Unit shall be rounded up
to the next higher Series A PIK Preferred Unit)).

(C) If, in violation of this Agreement, the Partnership fails to pay in full
or part any Series A Quarterly Distribution in cash when due, then, without
limiting any rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units to compel
the Partnership to make such distribution, from and after the first date of
such failure and continuing until such failure is cured by payment in full in
cash of all arrearages with respect to any Series A Quarterly Distribution
payable in cash, including accrued but unpaid interest thereon, (w) the amount
of such unpaid distributions ("Series A Unpaid Cash Distributions") will
accrue and

 



68  accumulate from and including the first day of the Quarter immediately
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment is due until paid in
full, (x) any Series A Unpaid Cash Distribution shall accrue interest from
the applicable Series A Distribution Payment Date at rate equal to 6.0% per
annum, and (y) the Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall not,
declare or make (i) any distributions in respect of any Junior Interests and
(ii) any distributions in respect of any Series A Parity Securities.

(D) If all or any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution is to be paid
in cash, then the aggregate amount of such cash to be so distributed in
respect of the Series A Preferred Units Outstanding as of the Record Date for
such Series A Quarterly Distribution shall be paid out of Available Cash
prior to making any distribution pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_.
To the extent that any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution to be paid
in cash with respect to any Quarter, together with any portion of a Series C
Quarterly Distribution, Series D Quarterly Distribution and Series E Quarterly
Distribution to be paid in cash with respect to such Quarter, exceeds the
amount of Available Cash for such Quarter, an amount of cash equal to the
Available Cash for such Quarter will be paid to the Series A Unitholders, the
Series C Unitholders, the Series D Unitholders and the Series E Unitholders
Pro Rata and the balance of such Series A Quarterly Distribution (and Series
C Quarterly Distribution, Series D Quarterly Distribution and Series E
Quarterly Distribution) shall be unpaid and shall constitute an arrearage and
accrue interest as set forth in _Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C)_. The
Partnership shall provide written notice to the Series A Unitholders, not
later than the last Business Day of the month immediately following the end of
such Quarter, describing in reasonable detail the Partnerships calculation of
Available Cash for such Quarter and the portion, if any, of the Series A
Quarterly Distribution the Partnership will be unable to pay on the applicable
Series A Distribution Payment Date.

 

(E) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.12(b)(ii)_ to the contrary,
with respect to Series A Preferred Units that are converted into Common
Units, the holder thereof shall not be entitled to a Series A Preferred Unit
distribution and a Common Unit distribution with respect to the same period,
but shall be entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the
class of Units held as of the close of business on the applicable Record Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, if a Series A Conversion Notice Date occurs prior
to the close of business on a Record Date for payment of a distribution on
the Common Units, the applicable holder of Series A Preferred Units shall
receive only the Common Unit distribution with respect to such period.

 

(F) Notwithstanding anything in Article VI to the contrary, neither the
General Partner nor the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights shall be
entitled to receive distributions or allocations of income or gain that
correspond or relate to amounts distributed or allocated to Unitholders in
respect of Series A Preferred Units, regardless of whether the amounts
so distributed or allocated in respect of the Series A Preferred Units were
determined under clause (ii) of the definition of "Series A Distribution Rate"
or were otherwise determined on an "as converted" basis.

 



69 (iii) _Issuance of Series A Preferred Units_. The Series A-1
Convertible Preferred Units (excluding Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Units
issued as Series A PIK Preferred Units) shall be issued by the Partnership
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement. The Series
A-2 Convertible Preferred Units (excluding Series A-2 Convertible Preferred
Units issued as Series A PIK Preferred Units) shall be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Series A-2 Convertible
Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement between the Partnership and Magnolia
Infrastructure Partners, LLC, dated as of March 30, 2015.

(iv) _Liquidation Value_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Partnership under _Section 12.4_ or a sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, either voluntary or involuntary, the Record Holders of the
Series A Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of
the Partnership available for distribution to the Partners or any assignees,
prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the Partnership
to the Record Holders of any other class or series of Partnership Interests
(other than Series C Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E
Preferred Units as to which the Series A Preferred Units are pari passu),
the positive value in each such holders Capital Account in respect of such
Series A Preferred Units. If in the year of such liquidation and winding up,
or sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Partnership, any such Record Holders Capital Account in
respect of such Series A Preferred Units is less than the aggregate Series A
Liquidation Value of such Series A Preferred Units, then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and prior to any other
allocation pursuant to this Agreement for such year and prior to any
distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, items of gross income and
gain shall be allocated to all Unitholders then holding Series A Preferred
Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of each Outstanding
Series A Preferred Unit is equal to the Series A Liquidation Value (and no
other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such
allocation), with such allocation being made Pro Rata with any allocation
made pursuant to the second sentences of _Section 5.14(b)(iv)_, _Section
5.15(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_. If in the year of such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up any such Record Holders Capital
Account in respect of such Series A Preferred Units is less than the aggregate
Series A Liquidation Value of such Series A Preferred Units after the
application of the preceding sentence, then to the extent permitted by
applicable law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, items of gross income and gain for any preceding taxable period(s)
with respect to which IRS Form 1065 Schedules K-1 have not been filed by the
Partnership shall be reallocated to all Unitholders then holding Series A
Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of each such
Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit after making allocations pursuant to this
and the immediately preceding sentence is equal to the Series A Liquidation
Value (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the
effect of such allocation), with such allocation being made Pro Rata with any
allocation made pursuant to the third sentences of _Section 5.14(b)(iv)_,
_Section 5.15(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_. At such time as such
allocations have been made to

 



70  the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, any remaining Net Termination Gain
or Net Termination Loss shall be allocated to the Partners pursuant to
_Section 6.1(c)_ or  _Section 6.1(d)_, as the case may be. At the time of
the dissolution of the Partnership, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware
Act, the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall become entitled
to receive any distributions in respect of the Series A Preferred Units that
are accrued and unpaid as of the date of such distribution in priority over
any entitlement of any other Partners or Assignees with respect to any
distributions by the Partnership to such other Partners or Assignees (other
than Series C Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred
Units as to which the Series A Preferred Units are pari passu); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the General Partner, as such, will have no liability for any
obligations with respect to such distributions to any Record Holder(s) of
Series A Preferred Units.

 

(v) Voting Rights.

 

(A) Except as provided in _Section 5.12(b)(v)(B)_ below, the Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the
voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a
single class, so that each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit will be
entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series A Preferred
Unit is then convertible on each matter with respect to which each Common Unit
is entitled to vote. Each reference in this Agreement to a vote of Record
Holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of
Common Units, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Units, Series C Preferred
Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units on an "as if"
converted basis, and the definition of "Unit Majority" shall correspondingly
be construed to mean at least a majority of the Common Units, the Series A
Preferred Units, the Series B Units, the Series C Preferred Units, the Series
D Preferred Units and the Series E Preferred Units, on an "as if" converted
basis, voting together as a single class during any period in which any
Series A Preferred Units are Outstanding.

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting separately as a
class based upon one vote per Series A Preferred Unit, shall be necessary on
any matter (including a merger, consolidation or business combination) that
adversely affects any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series
A Preferred Units or amends or modifies any of the terms of the Series A
Preferred Units; provided that the Partnership shall be able to amend this
_Section 5.12_ without the approval by the Record Holders of Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units so long as the amendment does not adversely affect
the holders of the Series A Preferred Units in any material respect and does
not affect the holders of the Series A Preferred Units disproportionately
in relation to the holders of Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership may, without the consent or approval of the Record Holders of
Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, create (by reclassification or
otherwise) and issue Junior Interests (including by amending

 



71  the provisions of any existing class of Partnership Interests to make such
class of Partnership Interests a class of Junior Interests) in an unlimited
amount. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any action
shall be deemed to adversely affect the holders of the Series A Preferred
Units in a material respect if such action would:

 

(1) reduce the Series A Distribution Rate, change the form of payment of
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, defer the date from which
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units will accrue, cancel accrued and
unpaid distributions on the Series A Preferred Units or any interest accrued
thereon, or change the seniority rights of the Series A Unitholders as to the
payment of distributions in relation to the Unitholders of any other class or
series of Units or, except as determined to be appropriate in connection with
the issuance of Junior Interests, amend this _Section 5.12_;

 

(2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the holders of
the Series A Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets,
of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation preferences of
the holders of the Series A Preferred Units in relation to the rights upon
liquidation of the holders of any other class or series of Units;

(3) make the Series A Preferred Units redeemable or convertible at the option
of the Partnership; or

(4) result in a Preferred Unit Change of Control.

 

(vi) _No Series A Parity Securities or Series A Senior Securities_. Other than
Series A PIK Preferred Units issued in connection with the Series A Quarterly
Distribution, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, issue any
Series A Parity Securities or Series A Senior Securities.

(vii) Certificates.

 

(A) The Series A Preferred Units shall be evidenced by Certificates in such
form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of
any applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned
or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign the
responsibility to another Person, the Partnership will act as the registrar
and transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Units. The Certificates
evidencing Series A Preferred Units shall be separately identified and shall
not bear the same CUSIP number as the Certificates evidencing Common Units.

 



72 (B) The certificate(s) representing the Series A Preferred Units may be
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form (but, if
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, may refer to the Fourth A/R
Partnership Agreement or Fifth A/R Partnership Agreement):

 

"NEITHER THE OFFER NOR SALE OF THESE SECURITIES HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER AND, IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION
EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION, UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT OR
THE PARTNERSHIP HAS RECEIVED DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT
SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT. THIS SECURITY
IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE SIXTH AMENDED
AND RESTATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP, DATED AS OF
[], 2017, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PARTNERSHIP AT ITS
PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

 

(viii) _Conversion_.

 

(A) _At the Option of the Series A Unitholder_. At any time and from time to
time after January 1, 2014, subject to any applicable limitations in the New
Credit Agreement, the Series A Preferred Units owned by any Series A
Unitholder shall be convertible, in whole or in part, upon the request of the
Series A Unitholder into a number of Common Units determined by multiplying
the number of Series A Preferred Units to be converted by the Series A
Conversion Rate. Immediately upon any conversion of Series A Preferred Units,
all rights of the Series A Converting Unitholder in respect thereof shall
cease, including, without limitation, any accrual of distributions, and such
Series A Converting Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as the owner
of Common Units. Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any person
pursuant to this  _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(A)_ (each fractional Common Unit
shall be rounded to the nearest whole Common Unit (and a 0.5 Common Unit shall
be rounded up to the next higher Common Unit)).

 

(B) _Conversion Notice_. To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units
pursuant to  _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(A)_, the Series A Converting Unitholder
shall give written notice (a "Series A Conversion Notice") to the Partnership
in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto stating that such Series A
Unitholder elects to so convert Series A Preferred Units and shall state
therein with respect to Series A Preferred Units to be converted pursuant to
_Section 5.12(b)(viii)(A)_ the following: (a) the number of Series A-1
Convertible Preferred Units and the number of Series A-2 Convertible
Preferred Units to be

 



73  converted, (b) the Certificate(s) evidencing the Series A Preferred Units to
be converted and duly endorsed, (c) the name or names in which such Series A
Unitholder wishes the Certificate or Certificates for Series A Conversion
Units to be issued, and (d) such Series A Unitholders computation of the
number of Series A Conversion Units to be received by such Series A Unitholder
(or designated recipient(s)) upon the Series A Conversion Date. The date any
Series A Conversion Notice is received by the Partnership shall be hereinafter
be referred to as a "Series A Conversion Notice Date."

 

(C) _Timing; Certificates_. If a Series A Conversion Notice is delivered by a
Series A Unitholder to the Partnership in accordance with _Section
5.12(b)(viii)(B)_, the Partnership shall issue the Series A Conversion Units
no later than seven (7) days after a Series A Conversion Notice Date (any date
of issuance of such Common Units, a "Series A Conversion Date"). On the
Series A Conversion Date, the Partnership shall issue to such Series A
Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) a Certificate or Certificates for the
number of Series A Conversion Units to which such holder shall be entitled.
In lieu of delivering physical Certificates representing the Series A
Conversion Units issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Units,
provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depositorys Fast
Automated Securities Transfer program, upon request of the Series A
Unitholder, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series A Conversion
Units issuable upon conversion or distribution payment to such Series A
Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the
Series A Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) prime broker with the
Depository through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The
parties agree to coordinate with the Depository to accomplish this objective.
Upon issuance of Series A Conversion Units to the Series A Converting
Unitholder, all rights under the converted Series A Preferred Units shall
cease, and such Series A Converting Unitholder shall be treated for all
purposes as the Record Holder of such Series A Conversion Units.

(D) _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership_. If the Partnership (i) makes a distribution on its Common Units
in Common Units, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units into a
greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its Common
Units into a smaller number of Common Units or (iv) issues by reclassification
of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any reclassification
in connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which
the Partnership is the surviving Person), then the Series A Conversion Rate in
effect at the time of the Record Date for such distribution or the effective
date of such subdivision, split, combination, or reclassification shall be
proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of the Series A Preferred
Units after such time shall entitle each Series A Unitholder to receive the
aggregate number of Common Units (or any Partnership Interests into which
such Common Units would have been combined, consolidated, merged or
reclassified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) above) that such Series A
Unitholder

 



74  would have been entitled to receive if the Series A Preferred Units had been
converted into Common Units immediately prior to such Record Date or effective
date, as the case may be, and in the case of a merger, consolidation or
business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person, the
Partnership shall provide effective provisions to ensure that the provisions
in this _Section 5.12_ relating to the Series A Preferred Units shall not be
abridged or amended and that the Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter
retain the same powers, preferences and relative participating, optional and
other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereon, that the Series A Preferred Units had immediately prior to such
transaction or event. An adjustment made pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)(viii)(D)_ shall become effective immediately after the Record Date in
the case of a distribution and shall become effective immediately after the
effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination, reclassification
(including any reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or
business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person) or
split. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event described
above shall occur.

 

If, in the future, the Partnership issues any options, warrants, or other
rights to purchase Common Units, or Partnership Interests exercisable or
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units (or options, warrants, or
other rights to purchase any such Partnership Interests that are exercisable
or convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units) other than any such
options, warrants or other rights issued pursuant to any Long Term Incentive
Plan (herein collectively, "Convertible Securities"), the General Partner
shall, at the direction and at the option of the holders of a majority of the
Outstanding Series A Preferred Units in their sole discretion, either (i)
amend the provisions of this Agreement relating to antidilution protection to
(A) revise any such provision that is less favorable than the corresponding
provision offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities (or any related
purchase agreement) so that such provision is the same as such provision
offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities (or any related purchase
agreement) and (B) incorporate any provision(s) offered in the terms of such
Convertible Securities (or any related purchase agreement) that is not
currently provided for in this Agreement and which would make the antidilution
protection provisions of this Agreement more favorable to the holders of
Series A Preferred Units, which amendment shall be effective concurrently with
the issuance and/or execution of documentation relating to such Convertible
Securities, or (ii) retain the antidilution language applicable to the Series
A Preferred Units at such time. The Partnership agrees to provide as much
prior notice of the proposed issuance of any such Convertible Securities
and/or execution of documentation relating to such issuance of Convertible
Securities as is reasonably practicable (and in any event, such notice shall
be provided at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such issuance and/or
execution).

 



75 (E) Follow-On Adjustments. Except in connection with the issuance of the
Series C Warrant or the Series D Warrant or the exercise of any Warrant, if
the Partnership shall issue or sell, or grant any Common Units or Convertible
Securities at an indicative per Common Unit price (the "Follow-On Price," and
such Common Units or Convertible Securities so issued, sold or granted, on an
as-converted basis, the "Follow-On Units") that is less than one hundred
percent (100%) of the Series A Adjusted Issue Price, then the Series A
Conversion Rate will be reset so that it will equal the number determined by
dividing the Series A Adjusted Issue Price immediately before the issuance of
the Follow-On Units by the result achieved through application of the
following formula:

 

((CP x OB) + (FP x Q)) / OA

 

Where:

CP = the Series A Adjusted Issue Price in effect immediately before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

FP = the Follow-On Price

 

OB = the total number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

 

Q = the total number of fully diluted Follow-On Units issued

 

OA = the total number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding after giving
effect to the issuance of the Follow-On Units.

 

For purposes of this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(E)_, the indicative price per
Common Unit resulting from the issuance of Convertible Securities will be
determined using the principles set forth in _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(H)(3)_.

(F) Other Extraordinary Transactions Affecting the Partnership.

(1) Prior to the consummation of any recapitalization, reorganization,
consolidation, merger, spin-off or other business combination (not otherwise
addressed in _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(D)_ above) in which the holders of Common
Units are to receive securities, cash or other assets (a "Partnership
Event"), the Partnership shall, as promptly as practicable, but in any event
no later than twelve (12) Business Days prior to the consummation of the
Partnership Event, make an irrevocable written offer (a "Series A Partnership
Event Change of Control Offer"), subject to consummation of the Partnership
Event, to each holder of Series A Preferred Units to redeem all (but not less
than all) of such holders Series A Preferred Units for a price per Series A
Preferred Unit payable in cash equal to the greater of (x) the Series A
Liquidation Value for each Series A Preferred Unit and (y) an amount equal to
the product of (1) the number of Common Units into which each Series A
Preferred Unit is convertible pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_ on the day
immediately

 



76  prior to the date of the Series A Partnership Event Change of Control Offer
and (2) the sum of (A) the cash consideration per Common Unit to be paid to
the holders of Common Units pursuant to the Partnership Event plus (B) the
fair market value per Common Unit of the securities or other assets to be
distributed to the holders of the Common Units pursuant to the Partnership
Event (as applicable, the "Series A Partnership Event Payment").

(2) Upon receipt by a Series A Unitholder of a Series A Partnership Event
Change of Control Offer, such Series A Unitholder may elect, by written
notice received by the Partnership no later than five (5) Business Days after
the receipt by such holder of a Series A Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer, to receive Series A Survivor Preferred Securities (as defined below)
pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(F)(2)_ in lieu of a Series A
Partnership Event Payment. Upon receipt of such Series A Unitholders election
to receive Series A Survivor Preferred Securities, the Partnership shall as
promptly as practicable, but in any event prior to the consummation of any
Partnership Event, make appropriate provision to ensure that such electing
holders of Series A Preferred Units receive in such Partnership Event a
preferred security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from such
Partnership Event and containing provisions substantially equivalent to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Series A
Preferred Units, including _Section 5.12_ and _Section 7.3_ hereof, without
material abridgement, including, without limitation, the same powers,
preferences, rights to distributions, rights to accumulation and compounding
upon failure to pay distributions, and relative participating, optional or
other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereon, that the Series A Preferred Unit had immediately prior to such
Partnership Event (the "Series A Survivor Preferred Security"). The Series A
Conversion Rate in effect at the time of the effective date of such
Partnership Event shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of
a unit of Series A Survivor Preferred Security after such time shall entitle
the holder to the number of securities or amount of cash or other assets
which, if a Series A Preferred Unit had been converted into Common Units
immediately prior to such Partnership Event, such holder would have
been entitled to receive immediately following such Partnership Event.
Subsequent adjustments to the Conversion Price of the Series A Survivor
Preferred Security shall be made successively thereafter whenever any event
described in  _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(D)_, _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(E)_ or
this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(F)_ shall occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Partnership may consummate a Partnership Event without making
appropriate provision to ensure that the holders of Series A Preferred Units
receive a Series A Partnership Event Payment or Series A Survivor Preferred
Security, as applicable, with respect to such Partnership Event if prior to
such consummation the Partnership has received the prior written approval of
the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units.

 



77 (3) A Series A Partnership Event Change of Control Offer shall be mailed to
each Series A Unitholder and shall describe the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Partnership Event and state:

 

i) that the Series A Partnership Event Change of Control Offer is being made
pursuant to this  _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(F)_ and that the Partnership is
making an offer to redeem all Series A Preferred Units of such Unitholder
(subject to the consummation of the Partnership Event);

 

ii) the amount of the Series A Partnership Event Payment and the redemption
date, which shall be the date on which the Partnership Event is consummated
or as soon thereafter as practicable (the "Series A Partnership Event Payment
Date"); and

 

iii) the amount per Common Unit that each Common Unitholder is receiving in
connection with the Partnership Event.

 

On the Series A Partnership Event Payment Date, the Partnership (or its
successor) shall pay to each Unitholder of Series A Preferred Units that
accepts the Series A Partnership Event Change of Control Offer an amount in
cash equal to such holders applicable Series A Partnership Event Payment, and
all of such holders rights and privileges under the Series A Preferred Units
or as a Series A Unitholder shall be extinguished.

(G) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this  _Section
5.12(b)(viii)_, no adjustment shall be made to the Series A Conversion Rate
pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(D)-(F)_ as a result of any of the
following:

 

(1) the grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase
Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise of any such
options, warrants or rights to employees, officers or directors of the General
Partner or the Partnership and its Subsidiaries in respect of services
provided to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries,
under compensation plans and agreements approved in good faith by the General
Partner (including any Long Term Incentive Plan); provided that, in the case
of options, warrants or rights to purchase Common Units, the exercise price
per Common Unit shall not be less than the Closing Price on the date such
option, warrant or other right is issued;

(2) the issuance of any Common Units as all or part of the consideration to
effect (i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets of an
unrelated third party in an arms-length transaction or (ii) the consummation
of a merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Partnership
with or into another entity to the extent such transaction(s) is or are
validly approved by the vote or consent of the General Partner; and

 



78 (3) the issuance of Partnership Interests for which an adjustment is made
under another provision of this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_.

(H) The following rules shall apply for purposes of this  _Section
5.12(b)(viii)_:

(1) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of Common
Units for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash
paid therefor before deducting any reasonable underwriting discounts or
placement agent fees, commissions or the expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
the Partnership for any underwriting or placement agent or otherwise in
connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(2) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of
Common Units for consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be valued at the Agreed Value thereof;

 

(3) In the case of the issuance or sale of Convertible Securities, the
following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this _Section
5.12(b)(viii)(H)_:

i) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon
exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) of options or warrants to purchase
or rights to subscribe for Common Units shall be deemed to have been issued
at the time such options, warrants or rights were issued and for consideration
equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in this _Section
5.12(b)(viii)(H)_), if any, received by the Partnership upon the issuance of
such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in
such options, warrants or rights (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for the Common Units covered thereby.

ii) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon conversion
of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without

 



79  limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities
or upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase or rights to
subscribe for such convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time
such securities were issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued
and for a consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by the
Partnership for any such securities or options, warrants or rights, plus the
minimum additional consideration, if any, to be received by the Partnership
(without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of such
options, warrants or rights and subsequent conversion or exchange of the
underlying convertible or exchangeable securities, as appropriate (the
consideration in each case to be determined in the manner provided in this
_Section 5.12(b)(viii)_).

 

iii) In the event of any change in (x) the number of Common Units deliverable
or (y) the consideration payable to the Partnership upon exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to either Common Units or such
convertible or exchangeable securities or upon conversion of or in exchange
for such convertible or exchangeable securities and not otherwise entitled to
any appropriate antidilution adjustment pursuant to this _Section 5.12_,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Series A Conversion Rate, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be
made for the actual issuance of Common Units or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or
the conversion or exchange of such securities.

iv) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights with respect
to either Common Units or such convertible or exchangeable securities or the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, the Series A Conversion
Rate, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options,
warrants, rights or securities shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of Common Units actually issued upon the exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to 

 



80  Common Units, upon the conversion or exchange of such securities, or the
number of Common Units issuable upon conversion or exchange of the convertible
or exchangeable securities that were actually issued upon exercise of
options, warrants or rights related to such securities.

v) the number of Common Units deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid
therefor pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(H)(3)i)_ and ii) shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either  _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(H)(3)iii)_ or _iv)_.

(4) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this  _Section
5.12(b)(viii)(H)_, no adjustment shall be made to the number of Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Units or the Series A
Conversion Rate as a result of an event for which an adjustment is made
under another provision of this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(H)_.

(5) For purposes of this  _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_, no adjustment to the
Series A Conversion Rate shall be made in an amount less than 1/100th of one
cent per Unit; _provided_ that any adjustments that are not required to be
made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment made.

(I) In the event of any taking by the Partnership of a Record Date of the
holders of any class of Partnership Interests for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any distribution thereon, any
security or right convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive
additional Common Units, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any Partnership Interests or any other securities or property of the
Partnership, or to receive any other right, the Partnership shall notify each
holder of Series A Preferred Units at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Record Date, of which any such Record Date is to be taken for the purpose of
such distribution, security or right and the amount and character of
such distribution, security or right; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing requirement shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any holder of
Series A Preferred Units if at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Record
Date, the Partnership shall have issued a press release which shall be posted
on the Partnerships website and carried by one or more wire services,
containing the required information.

 

(J) The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise, property or similar taxes, that may
be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of Series A Conversion Units on
conversion of, or payment of distributions on, Series A Preferred Units

 



81  pursuant hereto. _However_ , the holder of any Series A Preferred Units
shall pay any tax that is due because the Series A Conversion Units issuable
upon conversion thereof or distribution payment thereon are issued in a name
other than such Series A Unitholders name.

(K) The Partnership agrees that it will act in good faith to make any
adjustment(s) required by this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_ equitably and in such
a manner as to afford the Series A Unitholders the benefits of the provisions
hereof, and will not take any action that could reasonably be expected to
deprive such Series A Unitholders of the benefit hereof.

(ix) _Remarketing_. If any Series A Unitholder approaches the Partnership
with a desire to sell more than 250,000 Series A Preferred Units, or Series A
Conversion Units underlying such Series A Preferred Units having equivalent
economic value (based on the sum of the Series A Issue Price of the Series A
Preferred Units and all accrued and accumulated but unpaid distributions on
such Series A Preferred Units), the Partnership shall, upon the request of
such Series A Unitholder, cooperate reasonably with such Series A
Unitholder to provide information requested by potential purchasers to
potential purchasers, to make the Partnerships management reasonably
available by telephone and to confirm that the Partnership has made all
requisite filings required under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that, prior to
providing any information requested or conducting any telephonic discussions,
such potential purchasers enter into a customary non-disclosure agreement in
respect of such information provided by the Partnership in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Partnership.

(x) _Tax Estimates_. Upon receipt of a written request from any Series A
Unitholder stating the number of Series A Preferred Units owned by such holder
(which requests shall be made no more than two (2) times per calendar year and
the first such request per calendar year shall be at the Partnerships
expense, and the second at the expense of such requesting holder), the
Partnership shall, within ten (10) days, provide such Series A Unitholder with
a good faith estimate (and reasonable supporting calculations) of
whether there is sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to the Partnership
property such that, if such Series A Unitholder converted its Series A
Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(A)_ and such Unrealized
Gain was allocated to such holder pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)(iii)_, such
holders Capital Account in respect of its converted Series A Preferred Units
would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common
Unit (other than a Series A Conversion Unit received in connection with such
conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit).

(xi) _Fully Paid and Nonassessable_. Any Series A Conversion Unit(s)
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act), free
and clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than those
arising under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the holders
thereof.

 



82 (xii) _Listing of Common Units_. The Partnership will procure, at its
sole expense, the listing of the Series A Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Units, subject to issuance or notice of
issuance on any National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are
listed or admitted to trading.

(c) _Call Right on Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units_. At any time after
January 1, 2016, in connection with the consummation of a Drop Down Event (as
defined below) the Partnership may exercise the right (the "Series A-2 Call
Right"), but shall have no obligation, to require the holder or holders of the
Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units (the "Series A-2 Holders") to sell,
assign and transfer all or a portion of the then outstanding Series A-2
Convertible Preferred Units to the Partnership in accordance with this
_Section 5.12(c)_. The Partnership may exercise the Series A-2 Call Right
with respect to any Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Unit unless: (A) the
exercise of the Series A-2 Call Right would result in a default under any
applicable financing agreements, or other financing obligations of the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or would otherwise be prohibited by any
securities or other applicable law or (B) a Series A-2 Holder has delivered,
on or prior to the date of the Series A-2 Call Exercise Notice (as defined
below), a Series A Conversion Notice with respect to such Series A Convertible
Preferred Unit (and then no Series A-2 Call Right may be made as to such
Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Unit).

 

(i) A "Drop Down Event" shall mean an acquisition by the Partnership or one of
its Affiliates from Arclight Energy Partners Fund V, L.P. or one of its
Affiliates of assets or equity in a Person or Persons for a purchase price in
excess of $100 million.

 

(ii) The purchase price to be paid by the Partnership in connection with the
exercise of the Series A-2 Call Right shall be $17.50 per Series A-2
Convertible Preferred Unit acquired pursuant to the Series A-2 Call Right
(subject to appropriate adjustment for any equity distribution, subdivision or
combination of Partnership Interests).

 

(iii) If the Partnership elects to exercise the Series A-2 Call Right, the
Partnership shall deliver a written notice (the "Series A-2 Call Exercise
Notice") to the Series A-2 Holders informing the Series A-2 Holders of the
Partnerships intention to exercise its Series A-2 Call Right. The Series A-2
Call Exercise Notice shall include a certificate in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Annex A_ , setting forth (A) the number of Series A-2
Convertible Preferred Units held by each Series A-2 Holder, (B) the number of
Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units with respect to which the Series A-2
Call Right is being exercised, (C) the bank account information for wire
transfer of the purchase price or address for delivery of the purchase price
by check, and (D) the closing date for the purchase (the "Series A-2 Call
Closing Date"), which shall be no earlier than 10 days or later than 30 days
after the date of the Series A-2 Call Exercise Notice. If any Series A-2
Holder does not notify the Partnership of a change to the bank account
information or address for delivery of the purchase prices set forth in _Annex
A_ prior to the date that is two days before the Series A-2 Call Closing Date,
the Partnership shall wire or deliver to each Series A-2 Holder its portion
of the purchase price in immediately available funds to such bank account or
address set forth on _Annex A_.

 



83 (iv) The Series A-2 Call Right may be exercised as to any portion of
the outstanding Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units outstanding at the
time a Series A-2 Call Exercise Notice is delivered, but must be exercised
pro-rata as to all Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units subject to the
Series A-2 Call Right.

 

(v) At the closing of the Series A-2 Call Right, (A) the Partnership shall
deliver to each Series A-2 Holder subject thereto a certificate executed on
behalf of the Partnership in the form attached hereto as _Annex B_ , and (B)
each such Series A-2 Holder shall deliver to the Partnership a certificate
executed by such Series A-2 Holder in the form attached hereto as _Annex C_ ,
the certificates representing the Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Units with
transfer powers, executed in blank, or, if uncertificated, transfer powers
executed in blank, and such other documentation as may reasonably be
requested by the Partnership.

Section 5.13 _Establishment of Series B Units_.

 

(a) _General_. The Partnership hereby designates and creates a series of Units
to be designated as "Series B Units" and consisting of a total of 1,168,225
Series B Units, plus any additional Series B Units issued in kind as a
distribution pursuant to _Section 5.13(d)_, having the same rights,
preferences and privileges, and subject to the same duties and obligations,
as the Common Units, except as set forth in this _Section 5.13_.

(b) _Rights on Liquidation of the Partnership_. The holders of the Series B
Units shall have rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership,
including the right to share in any liquidating distributions pursuant to
_Section 12.4_, in accordance with  _Article XII_ of this Agreement.

(c) _Conversion of Series B Units_.

 

(i) Immediately before the close of business on the Series B Conversion Date,
the Series B Units shall automatically convert into Common Units on a one-
for-one basis.

(ii) Upon conversion, the rights of a holder of converted Series B Units
as holder of Series B Units shall cease with respect to such converted Series
B Units, including any rights under this Agreement with respect to holders of
Series B Units, and such Person shall continue to be a Limited Partner and
have the rights of a holder of Common Units under this Agreement. Upon the
Series B Conversion Date, all Series B Units shall be deemed to be transferred
to, and cancelled by, the Partnership in exchange for the Common Units into
which the Series B Units converted.

 

(iii) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common Units
upon conversion of the Series B Units. _However_ , the holder shall pay any
tax or duty which may be payable relating to any transfer involving the
issuance or delivery of Common Units in a name other than the holders name.
The Transfer Agent may refuse to deliver the Certificate representing Common
Units being issued in a name other than the holders name until the Transfer
Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due
because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holders name.
Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or
regulation.

 



84 (A) The Partnership shall keep free from preemptive rights a sufficient number
of Common Units to permit the conversion of all outstanding Series B Units
into Common Units to the extent provided in, and in accordance with, this
_Section 5.13(c)_.

 

(B) All Common Units delivered upon conversion of the Series B Units shall be
newly issued, shall be duly authorized and validly issued, and shall be free
from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim

(C) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Common Units upon conversion of
Series B Units and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on the New
York Stock Exchange, or any other National Securities Exchange or other
market, shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed and quoted the
Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Series B Units to the extent
permitted or required by the rules of such exchange or market.

 

(D) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall give
to any holder of Series B Units any rights as a creditor in respect of its
right to conversion.

(d) _Distributions and Allocations_.

 

(i) Each Series B Unit shall have the right to share in distributions and
allocations pursuant to _Section 6.1_,  _Section 6.4_ and _Section 6.5_ on
a Pro Rata basis with the other Common Units. For the avoidance of doubt, each
reference in this Agreement to an allocation or distribution to Unitholders
holding Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the Unitholders
holding Common Units or Series B Units. All or any portion of each
distribution payable in respect of the Series B Units (the "Series B Unit
Distribution") may, at the election of the Partnership, be paid in Series B
PIK Units (any amount of such Series B Unit Distributions so paid in Series B
PIK Units, the "Series B PIK Distribution Amount"). The number of Series B PIK
Units to be issued in connection with a Series B PIK Distribution Amount
shall be the quotient of (A) the Series B PIK Distribution Amount divided by
(B) the Series B Issue Price of the Series B Units originally issued pursuant
to the Series B Unit Purchase Agreement; _provided_ that instead of issuing
any fractional Series B PIK Units, the Partnership shall round the number of
Series B PIK Units issued down to the next lower whole Series B PIK Unit and
pay cash in lieu of such fractional units, or at the Partnerships option,
the Partnership may round the number of Series B PIK Units issued up to the
next higher whole Series B PIK Unit.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.13(d)_ to the contrary, with
respect to Series B Units that are converted into Common Units, the holder
thereof shall not be entitled to a Series B Unit Distribution and a Common
Unit distribution with respect to the same period, but shall be entitled only
to the distribution to be paid based upon the class of Units held as of the
close of business on the applicable Record Date.

 



85 (iii) When any Series B PIK Units are payable to a holder of Series B
Units pursuant to this _Section 5.13_, the Partnership shall issue the
Series B PIK Units to such holder no later than the date the corresponding
distributions are made pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ or _Section 6.5_,
as applicable (the date of issuance of such Series B PIK Units, the "Series B
PIK Payment Date"). On the Series B PIK Payment Date, the Partnership shall
issue to such holder of Series B Units a Certificate or Certificates for
the number of Series B PIK Units to which such holder of Series B Units shall
be entitled.

(iv) For purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, if the Partnership
distributes one or more Series B PIK Units to a holder of Series B Units, (A)
the Partnership shall be treated as distributing cash to such holder of Series
B Units equal to the Series B PIK Distribution Amount, and (B) the holder of
Series B Units shall be deemed to have recontributed to the Partnership in
exchange for such newly issued Series B PIK Units an amount of cash equal to
the Series B PIK Distribution Amount less the amount of any cash distributed
by the Partnership in lieu of fractional Series B PIK Units, as applicable.

(v) If the Partnership distributes one or more Series B PIK Units to a holder
of Series B Units in accordance with the foregoing and _Section
6.4(b)(iii)(C)_, the distribution to the holders of the Incentive Distribution
Rights pursuant to  _Section 6.4(b)(iii)(B)_ that would have been made
pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_(iii)(B) in the absence of this _Section
5.13(d)(v)_ shall be reduced by the product of (A) the distribution to the
holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights that would have been made
pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)(iii)(B)_ in the absence of this _Section
5.13(d)(v)_ multiplied by (B) the quotient of (x) the Percentage Interests of
the Series B Units divided by (y) the Percentage Interests of the Common
Units and Series B Units.

(e) _Voting_. The Series B Units will have such voting rights pursuant to the
Agreement as such Series B Units would have if they were Common Units that
were then outstanding and shall vote together with the Common Units as a
single class, except that the Series B Units shall be entitled to vote as a
separate class on any matter on which Unitholders are entitled to vote that
adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Series B Units in relation
to other classes of Partnership Interests in any material respect or as
required by law. The approval of a majority of the Series B Units shall be
required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Series B Units are
entitled to vote as a separate class. For the avoidance of doubt, each
reference in this Agreement to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be
given to, Unitholders holding Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference
to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given to, Unitholders of Common
Units and Series B Units and each reference to the vote of, approval by, or
notice to be given to, a majority of the Outstanding Common Units shall be
deemed to be a reference to the vote of, approval by, or notice to be given
to, a majority of the Common Units and Series B Units, both as Outstanding
at such time.

 



86 (f) _Certificates_.

 

(i) The Series B Units shall be evidenced by Certificates in such form as the
General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of any
applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned or
transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign
the responsibility to another Person, the Partnership will act as the
registrar and transfer agent for the Series B Units. The Certificates
evidencing Series B Units shall be separately identified and shall not bear
the same CUSIP number as the Certificates evidencing Common Units or Series A
Preferred Units.

(ii) The certificate(s) representing the Series B Units shall be imprinted
with a legend in substantially the following form (but, if outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement, may refer to the Fourth A/R Partnership Agreement
or Fifth A/R Partnership Agreement):

 

"NEITHER THE OFFER NOR SALE OF THESE SECURITIES HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER AND, IN THE CASE OF A
TRANSACTION EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION, UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER
SUCH ACT OR THE PARTNERSHIP HAS RECEIVED DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY
TO IT THAT SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT. THIS
SECURITY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE
SIXTH AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP,
DATED AS OF [], 2017, AS AMENDED, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE
PARTNERSHIP AT ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

Section 5.14 _Establishment of Series C Preferred Units_.

 

(a) _General_. The Partnership hereby designates and creates a series of Units
to be designated as "Series C Convertible Preferred Units" and consisting of
a total of 8,571,429 Series C Preferred Units, plus any additional Series C
Preferred Units issued in kind as a distribution pursuant to _Section
5.14(b)(ii)_ ("Series C PIK Preferred Units"), having the same rights,
preferences and privileges, and subject to the same duties and obligations, as
the Common Units, except as set forth in this _Section 5.14_ and in _Section
5.5(d)(i)_,  _Section 6.10_, and _Section 12.9_. The Series C Convertible
Preferred Units, whether issued on the Series C Issuance Date or as Series C
PIK Preferred Units, are referred to herein as "Series C Preferred
Units." The Series C Preferred Units shall be considered pari passu as to
allocations and distributions with the Series A Preferred Units, Series D
Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units. Other than with respect to
Series C PIK Preferred Units, immediately following the Series C Issuance
Date and thereafter, no additional Series C Preferred Units shall be
designated, created or issued without the prior written approval of the
General Partner and the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series C
Preferred Units.

 



87 (b) _Rights of Series C Preferred Units_. The Series C Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and shall be subject to
the following duties and obligations:

(i)  _Allocations_.

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(a)_, (x)
following any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ and prior to
any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_, any Net Income shall be
allocated to all Unitholders holding Series C Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until
the aggregate of the Net Income allocated to such Unitholders pursuant to
this _Section 5.14(b)(i)(A)_ for the current and all previous taxable periods
since issuance of the Series C Preferred Units is equal to the aggregate
amount of cash distributed with respect to such Series C Preferred Units for
the current and previous taxable periods and (y) in no event shall any Net
Income be allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_ in respect of Series C
Preferred Units. Allocations to Series C Preferred Units pursuant to this
_Section 5.14(b)(i)(A)_, to Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.12 (b)(i)(A)_, to Series D Preferred Units pursuant to _Section

Units, but (y) following any allocation made pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(i)(A)_ and prior to any allocation made pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(i)(B)_, any remaining Net Termination Gain shall be allocated to all
Unitholders holding Series C Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital
Account in respect of each Outstanding Series C Preferred Unit is equal to

pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)(i)(C)_, to Series A Preferred Units
pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(i)(C)_, to Series D Preferred Units pursuant

(ii) _Distributions_.

 

(A) Commencing with the Quarter ending on June 30, 2016, the holders of the
Series C Preferred Units Outstanding as of an applicable Record Date shall be
entitled to receive cumulative distributions (each, a "Series C Quarterly
Distribution"), prior to any other distributions made in respect of any Junior
Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, in the amount set
forth in this _Section 5.14(b)(ii)(A)_ in respect of each Outstanding Series
C Preferred Unit. All such distributions shall be paid Quarterly within forty-
five (45) days after the end of each Quarter (each such payment date, a
"Series C Distribution Payment Date"). For the Quarter ending [December 31,
2017], and for each Quarter thereafter through and including the Quarter
ending immediately prior to the Series C Coupon Conversion Quarter, the
Series C Quarterly Distribution on each Outstanding Series C Preferred Unit
shall be paid a number of Series C PIK Preferred Units equal to the Series C
PIK Payment Amount; _provided_ that, in the discretion of the General Partner
which determination shall be made prior to the Record Date for the relevant
quarter, the Series C Quarterly Distribution may be paid with respect to each
Outstanding Series C Preferred Unit as (x) an amount in cash up to
the applicable Series C Distribution Rate, and (y) a number of Series C PIK
Preferred Units equal to (a) the remainder of (i) the applicable Series C
Distribution Rate less (ii) the amount of cash paid pursuant to clause (x),
divided by (b) the Series C Adjusted Issue Price (which, if paid in cash for
the Quarter in which the Series C Issuance Date occurs, the amount payable
shall be equal to the product of (I) the amount payable without regard to this
parenthetical times (II) a fraction, of which the numerator is the number of
days from and including the Series C Issuance Date up to but excluding the
date of such Quarters end, and of which the denominator is 91). With respect
to the Series C Coupon Conversion Quarter and all Quarters thereafter, the
Series C Quarterly Distributions shall be paid with respect to each
Outstanding Series C Preferred Unit entirely in cash at the applicable Series
C Subsequent Distribution Rate per Series C Preferred Unit. If the
Partnership establishes a Record Date for any distribution to be made by the

 



89  Partnership on other Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or
_Section 6.5_, then the Record Date established pursuant to this _Section
5.14(b)(ii)(A)_ for a Series C Quarterly Distribution in respect of any
Quarter shall be the same Record Date established for any distribution to be
made by the Partnership in respect of distributions on other Partnership
Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_ for such Quarter.
Unless otherwise expressly _provided_ , references in this Agreement to Series
C Preferred Units shall include all Series C PIK Preferred Units Outstanding
as of the date of such determination.

 

(B) When any Series C PIK Preferred Units are payable to a Record Holder of
Series C Preferred Units pursuant to this  _Section 5.14_, the Partnership
shall issue the Series C PIK Preferred Units to such Record Holder no later
than the Series C Distribution Payment Date (the date of issuance of such
Series C PIK Preferred Units, the "Series C PIK Preferred Payment Date"). On
the Series C PIK Preferred Payment Date, the Partnership shall issue to such
Series C Unitholder a Certificate or Certificates for the number of Series C
PIK Preferred Units to which such Series C Unitholder shall be entitled. The
issuance of the Series C PIK Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.14(b)(ii)_ shall be deemed to have been made on the first day of the Quarter
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment of Series C PIK
Preferred Units was due. Prior to the Series C Coupon Conversion Quarter, if,
in violation of this Agreement, the Partnership fails to pay in full or part
any Series C Quarterly Distribution in kind when due, then the holders
entitled to the unpaid Series C PIK Preferred Units shall be entitled (I) to
receive Series C Quarterly Distributions in subsequent Quarters in respect of
such unpaid Series C PIK Preferred Units, (II) to receive the Series C
Liquidation Value in accordance with _Section 5.14(b)(iv)_ in respect of
such unpaid Series C PIK Preferred Units, and (III) to all other rights under
this Agreement as if such unpaid Series C PIK Preferred Units had in fact been
distributed on the date due. Nothing in this _Section 5.14(b)(ii)(B)_ shall
alter the obligation of the Partnership to pay any unpaid Series C PIK
Preferred Units or the right of the holders of Series C Preferred Units to
enforce this Agreement to compel the Partnership to distribute any unpaid
Series C PIK Preferred Units. Fractional Series C PIK Preferred Units shall
not be issued to any person (each fractional Series C PIK Preferred Unit shall
be rounded to the nearest whole Series C PIK Preferred Unit (and a 0.5 Series
C PIK Preferred Unit shall be rounded up to the next higher Series C PIK
Preferred Unit)).

(C) If, in violation of this Agreement, the Partnership fails to pay in full
or part any Series C Quarterly Distribution in cash when due, then, without
limiting any rights of the holders of the Series C Preferred Units to compel
the Partnership to make such distribution, from and after the first date of
such failure and continuing until such failure is cured by payment in full in
cash of all arrearages with respect to any Series C Quarterly Distribution,
including accrued but unpaid interest thereon, (w) the amount of such unpaid
distributions ("Series C Unpaid Cash Distributions") will accrue and
accumulate from and including the first day of the Quarter immediately
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment is due until paid in
full, (x) any Series C Unpaid Cash Distribution shall accrue interest from the
applicable Series C Distribution Payment Date at rate equal to 11.79% per
annum, and (y) the Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall
not, declare or make (i) any distributions in respect of any Junior Interests
and (ii) any distributions in respect of any Series C Parity Securities.

 



90 (D) If all or any portion of a Series C Quarterly Distribution is to be paid
in cash, then the aggregate amount of such cash to be so distributed in
respect of the Series C Preferred Units Outstanding as of the Record Date for
such Series C Quarterly Distribution shall be paid out of Available Cash prior
to making any distribution pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_. To
the extent that any portion of a Series C Quarterly Distribution to be paid in
cash with respect to any Quarter, together with any portion of a Series A
Quarterly Distribution, Series D Quarterly Distribution and Series E
Quarterly Distribution to be paid in cash with respect to such Quarter,
exceeds the amount of Available Cash for such Quarter, an amount of cash equal
to the Available Cash for such Quarter will be paid to the Series A
Unitholders, the Series C Unitholders, the Series D Unitholders and the Series
E Unitholders Pro Rata and the balance of such Series C Quarterly Distribution
(and Series A Quarterly Distribution, Series D Quarterly Distribution and
Series E Quarterly Distribution) shall be unpaid and shall constitute an
arrearage and accrue interest as set forth in _Section 5.14(b)(ii)(C)_. The
Partnership shall provide written notice to the Series C Unitholders,
not later than the last Business Day of the month immediately following the
end of such Quarter, describing in reasonable detail the Partnerships
calculation of Available Cash for such Quarter and the portion, if any, of the
Series C Quarterly Distribution the Partnership will be unable to pay on the
applicable Series C Distribution Payment Date.

(E) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.14(b)(ii)_ to the contrary,
with respect to Series C Preferred Units that are converted into Common Units,
the holder thereof shall not be entitled to a Series C Preferred Unit
distribution and a Common Unit distribution with respect to the same period,
but shall be entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the class
of Units held as of the close of business on the applicable Record Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, if a Series C Conversion Notice Date occurs prior to
the close of business on a Record Date for payment of a distribution on the
Common Units, the applicable holder of Series C Preferred Units shall receive
only the Common Unit distribution with respect to such period.

(F) Notwithstanding anything in Article VI to the contrary, neither the
General Partner nor the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights shall be
entitled to receive distributions or allocations of income or gain that
correspond or relate to amounts distributed or allocated to Unitholders in
respect of Series C Preferred Units, regardless of whether the amounts so
distributed or allocated in respect of the Series C Preferred Units were
determined under the definition of "Series C Initial Distribution Rate" or
clause (ii) of the definition of "Series C Subsequent Distribution Rate" or
were otherwise determined on an "as converted" basis.

 



91 (iii) _Issuance of Series C Preferred Units_. The Series C
Convertible Preferred Units shall be issued by the Partnership pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Series C Unit Purchase Agreement.

 

(iv) _Liquidation Value_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Partnership under  _Section 12.4_ or a sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, either voluntary or involuntary, the Record Holders of the Series
C Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the
Partnership available for distribution to the Partners or any assignees, prior
and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the Partnership to the
Record Holders of any other class or series of Partnership Interests (other
than Series A Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred
Units as to which the Series C Preferred Units are pari passu), the positive
value in each such holders Capital Account in respect of such Series C
Preferred Units. If in the year of such liquidation and winding up, or sale,
exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, any such Record Holders Capital Account in respect of such
Series C Preferred Units is less than the aggregate Series C Liquidation
Value of such Series C Preferred Units, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, and prior to any other allocation
pursuant to this Agreement for such year and prior to any distribution
pursuant to the preceding sentence, items of gross income and gain shall be
allocated to all Unitholders then holding Series C Preferred Units, Pro Rata,
until the Capital Account in respect of each Outstanding Series C
Preferred Unit is equal to the Series C Liquidation Value (and no other
allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such
allocation), with such allocation being made Pro Rata with any allocation made
pursuant to the second sentences of  _Section 5.12 (b)(iv)_, _Section
5.15(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_. If in the year of such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up any such Record Holders Capital Account in respect
of such Series C Preferred Units is less than the aggregate Series C
Liquidation Value of such Series C Preferred Units after the application of
the preceding sentence, then to the extent permitted by applicable law and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, items
of gross income and gain for any preceding taxable period(s) with respect to
which IRS Form 1065 Schedules K-1 have not been filed by the Partnership shall
be reallocated to all Unitholders then holding Series C Preferred Units, Pro
Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of each such Outstanding Series C
Preferred Unit after making allocations pursuant to this and the immediately
preceding sentence is equal to the Series C Liquidation Value (and no
other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such
allocation), with such allocation being made Pro Rata with any allocation made
pursuant to the third sentences of _Section 5.12(b)(iv)_, _Section
5.15(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_. At such time as such allocations
have been made to the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units, any remaining Net
Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss shall be allocated to the Partners
pursuant to  _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_, as the case may be. At
the time of the dissolution of the Partnership, subject to Section 17-804 of
the Delaware Act, the Record Holders of the Series C Preferred Units shall
become entitled to receive any distributions in respect of the Series C
Preferred

 



92  Units that are accrued and unpaid as of the date of such distribution in
priority over any entitlement of any other Partners or Assignees with respect
to any distributions by the Partnership to such other Partners or Assignees
(other than Series A Preferred Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E
Preferred Units as to which the Series C Preferred Units are pari passu);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner, as such, will have no
liability for any obligations with respect to such distributions to any Record
Holder(s) of Series C Preferred Units.

 

(v) _Voting Rights_.

 

(A) Except as provided in _Section 5.14(b)(v)(B)_ below, the Outstanding
Series C Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the
voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a
single class, so that each Outstanding Series C Preferred Unit will be
entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series C Preferred
Unit is then convertible on each matter with respect to which each Common Unit
is entitled to vote. Each reference in this Agreement to a vote of Record
Holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of
Common Units, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Units, Series C Preferred
Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units on an "as if"
converted basis, and the definition of "Unit Majority" shall correspondingly
be construed to mean at least a majority of the Common Units, the Series A
Preferred Units, the Series B Units, the Series C Preferred Units, Series D
Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units, on an "as if" converted basis,
voting together as a single class during any period in which any Series C
Preferred Units are Outstanding.

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units, voting separately as a
class based upon one vote per Series C Preferred Unit, shall be necessary on
any matter (including a merger, consolidation or business combination) that
adversely affects any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series
C Preferred Units or amends or modifies any of the terms of the Series C
Preferred Units; _provided_ that the Partnership shall be able to amend this
_Section 5.14_ without the approval by the Record Holders of Outstanding
Series C Preferred Units so long as the amendment does not adversely affect
the holders of the Series C Preferred Units in any material respect and does
not affect the holders of the Series C Preferred Units disproportionately
in relation to the holders of Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership may, without the consent or approval of the Record Holders of
Outstanding Series C Preferred Units, create (by reclassification or
otherwise) and issue Junior Interests (including by amending the provisions
of any existing class of Partnership Interests to make such class of
Partnership Interests a class of Junior Interests) in an unlimited amount.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any action shall
be deemed to adversely affect the holders of the Series C Preferred Units in a
material respect if such action would:

 



93 (1) reduce the Series C Distribution Rate, change the form of payment
of distributions on the Series C Preferred Units, defer the date from which
distributions on the Series C Preferred Units will accrue, cancel accrued and
unpaid distributions on the Series C Preferred Units or any interest accrued
thereon, or change the seniority rights of the Series C Unitholders as to the
payment of distributions in relation to the Unitholders of any other class or
series of Units or, except as determined to be appropriate in connection with
the issuance of Junior Interests, amend this _Section 5.14_;

(2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the holders of
the Series C Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets,
of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation preferences of
the holders of the Series C Preferred Units in relation to the rights upon
liquidation of the holders of any other class or series of Units;

 

(3) make the Series C Preferred Units convertible at the option of the
Partnership; or

 

(4) result in a Preferred Unit Change of Control.

 

(vi) _No Series C Parity Securities or Series C Senior Securities_. Other than
Series C PIK Preferred Units issued in connection with the Series C Quarterly
Distribution, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units, issue any
Series C Parity Securities or Series C Senior Securities.

(vii) _Certificates_.

 

(A) The Series C Preferred Units shall be evidenced by Certificates in such
form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of
any applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned
or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign the
responsibility to another Person, the Partnership will act as the registrar
and transfer agent for the Series C Preferred Units. The Certificates
evidencing Series C Preferred Units shall be separately identified and shall
not bear the same CUSIP number as the Certificates evidencing Common Units.

(B) The certificate(s) representing the Series C Preferred Units may be
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form (but, if
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, may refer to the Fifth A/R
Partnership Agreement):

 



94 "NEITHER THE OFFER NOR SALE OF THESE SECURITIES HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER AND, IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION
EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION, UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT OR
THE PARTNERSHIP HAS RECEIVED DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT
SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT. THIS SECURITY
IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE SIXTH AMENDED
AND RESTATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP, DATED AS OF
[], 2017, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PARTNERSHIP AT ITS
PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

(viii) _Conversion_.

 

(A) _At the Option of the Series C Unitholder_. At any time and from time to
time, subject to any applicable limitations in the New Credit Agreement, the
Series C Preferred Units owned by any Series C Unitholder shall be
convertible, in whole or in part, upon the request of the Series C Unitholder
into a number of Common Units determined by multiplying the number of Series
C Preferred Units to be converted by the Series C Conversion Rate. Immediately
upon any conversion of Series C Preferred Units, all rights of the Series C
Converting Unitholder in respect thereof shall cease, including, without
limitation, any accrual of distributions, and such Series C Converting
Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as the owner of Common Units.
Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any person pursuant to this
_Section 5.14(b)(viii)(A)_ (each fractional Common Unit shall be rounded to
the nearest whole Common Unit (and a 0.5 Common Unit shall be rounded up to
the next higher Common Unit)).

 

(B) _At the Option of the Partnership_. At any time after the Series E
Optional Conversion Start Date, subject to any applicable limitations in the
New Credit Agreement, the Partnership, in the General Partners sole
discretion, shall have the option at any time, to convert all or any portion
of the Series C Preferred Units owned by any Series C Unitholder into a
number of Common Units determined by multiplying the number of Series C
Preferred Units to be converted by the Series C Conversion Rate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the aggregate amount of Series C Preferred Units subject
to conversion by the Partnership pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B)_
shall not involve an underlying value of Common Units exceeding the Series C
Threshold. The aggregate amount of Series C Preferred Units subject to
conversion pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B)_ shall be allocated
among the Series C Preferred Unitholders on a Pro Rata basis or on such other
basis as may be agreed upon by the Series C Preferred Unitholders. Immediately
upon any conversion of Series C Preferred Units, all rights of the Series C
Converting Unitholder in respect thereof

 



95  shall cease, including, without limitation, any accrual of distributions,
and such Series C Converting Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as
the owner of Common Units. Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any
person pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B)_ (each fractional Common
Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Common Unit (and a 0.5 Common Unit
shall be rounded up to the next higher Common Unit)). 

(C) _Conversion Notice_.

 

(1) To convert Series C Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(A)_, the Series C Converting Unitholder shall give written
notice (a "Series C Conversion Notice") to the Partnership in the form of
Exhibit D attached hereto stating that such Series C Unitholder elects to so
convert Series C Preferred Units and shall state therein with respect to
Series C Preferred Units to be converted pursuant to _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(A)_ the following: (a) the number of Series C Convertible
Preferred Units to be converted, (b) the Certificate(s) evidencing the Series
C Preferred Units to be converted and duly endorsed, (c) the name or names in
which such Series C Unitholder wishes the Certificate or Certificates for
Series C Conversion Units to be issued, and (d) such Series C Unitholders
computation of the number of Series C Conversion Units to be received by such
Series C Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) upon the Series C Conversion
Date. The date any Series C Conversion Notice is received by the Partnership
shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Series C Conversion Notice Date."

(2) To convert Series C Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to
_Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B)_, the Partnership shall give written notice (a
"Series C Forced Conversion Notice") to each Record Holder of Series C
Preferred Units in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto stating that the
Partnership elects to force conversion of such Series C Preferred Units
pursuant to Section 5.14(b)(viii)(B) and shall state therein: (a) the number
of Series C Convertible Preferred Units to be converted, (b) the
Certificate(s) evidencing the Series C Preferred Units to be converted and
duly endorsed, (c) the Partnerships computation of the number of Series C
Conversion Units to be delivered to such Series C Unitholder (or designated
recipient(s)) upon the Series C Conversion Date. The date any Series C
Conversion Notice is received by the Partnership shall hereinafter be referred
to as a "Series C Forced Conversion Notice Date." The Series C Conversion
Units shall be issued in the name of the Record Holder of such Series C
Preferred Units.

(D)  _Timing; Certificates_. If a Series C Conversion Notice is delivered by
a Series C Unitholder to the Partnership in accordance with _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(C)(1)_ or a Series C Forced Conversion Notice is delivered by
the Partnership to a Series C Unitholder in accordance with _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(C)(2)_, the Partnership shall issue the Series C Conversion
Units no

 



96  later than seven (7) days after a Series C Conversion Notice Date or the
Series C Forced Conversion Notice Date, as the case may be, occurs (any date
of issuance of such Common Units, a "Series C Conversion Date"). On the
Series C Conversion Date, the Partnership shall issue to such Series C
Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) a Certificate or Certificates for the
number of Series C Conversion Units to which such holder shall be entitled.

In lieu of delivering physical Certificates representing the Series C
Conversion Units issuable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Units,
provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depositorys Fast
Automated Securities Transfer program, upon request of the Series C
Unitholder, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series C Conversion
Units issuable upon conversion or distribution payment to such Series C
Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the
Series C Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) prime broker with the
Depository through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The parties
agree to coordinate with the Depository to accomplish this objective. Upon
issuance of Series C Conversion Units to the Series C Converting Unitholder,
all rights under the converted Series C Preferred Units shall cease, and such
Series C Converting Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as the Record
Holder of such Series C Conversion Units.

 

(E) _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership_. If the Partnership (i) makes a distribution on its Common Units
in Common Units, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units into a
greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its Common
Units into a smaller number of Common Units or (iv) issues by
reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any
reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or business
combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person), then the
Series C Conversion Rate in effect at the time of the Record Date for such
distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination, or
reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of
the Series C Preferred Units after such time shall entitle each Series C
Unitholder to receive the aggregate number of Common Units (or any Partnership
Interests into which such Common Units would have been combined, consolidated,
merged or reclassified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) above) that such
Series C Unitholder would have been entitled to receive if the Series C
Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such
Record Date or effective date, as the case may be, and in the case of a
merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the
surviving Person, the Partnership shall provide effective provisions to ensure
that the provisions in this _Section 5.14_ relating to the Series C
Preferred Units shall not be abridged or amended and that the Series C
Preferred Units shall thereafter retain the same powers, preferences and
relative participating, optional and other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, that the Series C
Preferred Units had immediately prior to such transaction or event. An
adjustment made pursuant to

 



97  this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(E)_ shall become effective immediately after
the Record Date in the case of a distribution and shall become effective
immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination, reclassification (including any reclassification in connection
with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership
is the surviving Person) or split. Such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever any event described above shall occur.

If, in the future, the Partnership issues any Convertible Securities,
the General Partner shall, at the direction and at the option of the holders
of a majority of the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units in their sole
discretion, either (i) amend the provisions of this Agreement relating to
antidilution protection to (A) revise any such provision that is less
favorable than the corresponding provision offered in the terms of such
Convertible Securities (or any related purchase agreement) so that such
provision is the same as such provision offered in the terms of such
Convertible Securities (or any related purchase agreement) and (B) incorporate
any provision(s) offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities (or any
related purchase agreement) that is not currently provided for in
this Agreement and which would make the antidilution protection provisions of
this Agreement more favorable to the holders of Series C Preferred Units,
which amendment shall be effective concurrently with the issuance and/or
execution of documentation relating to such Convertible Securities, or (ii)
retain the antidilution language applicable to the Series C Preferred Units at
such time. The Partnership agrees to provide as much prior notice of the
proposed issuance of any such Convertible Securities and/or execution of
documentation relating to such issuance of Convertible Securities as is
reasonably practicable (and in any event, such notice shall be provided at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to such issuance and/or execution).

(F) _Follow-On Adjustments_. Except in connection with the exercise of a
Warrant, if the Partnership shall issue or sell, or grant any Follow-on Units
at a Follow-on Price that is less than one hundred percent (100%) of the
Series C Adjusted Issue Price, then the Series C Conversion Rate will be reset
so that it will equal the number determined by dividing the Series C Adjusted
Issue Price immediately before the issuance of the Follow-On Units by the
result achieved through application of the following formula:

 

((CP x OB) + (FP x Q)) / OA

 

Where:

CP = the Series C Adjusted Issue Price in effect immediately before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

FP = the Follow-On Price

 



98 OB = the total number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

Q = the total number of fully diluted Follow-On Units issued OA = the total
number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding after giving effect to the
issuance of the Follow-On Units.

For purposes of this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(F)_, the indicative price per
Common Unit resulting from the issuance of Convertible Securities will be
determined using the principles set forth in _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(I)(3)_.

 

(G) _Other Extraordinary Transactions Affecting the Partnership_.

 

(1) Prior to the consummation of a Partnership Event, the Partnership shall,
as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than twelve (12)
Business Days prior to the consummation of the Partnership Event, make an
irrevocable written offer (a "Series C Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer"), subject to consummation of the Partnership Event, to each holder of
Series C Preferred Units to redeem all (but not less than all) of such
holders Series C Preferred Units for a price per Series C Preferred Unit
payable in cash equal to the greater of (x) the sum of the Series C Issue
Price and the Series C Unpaid Cash Distributions and (y) an amount equal to
the product of (1) the number of Common Units into which each Series C
Preferred Unit is convertible pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(viii)_ on the
day immediately prior to the date of the Series C Partnership Event Change of
Control Offer and (2) the sum of (A) the cash consideration per Common Unit to
be paid to the holders of Common Units pursuant to the Partnership Event
plus (B) the fair market value per Common Unit of the securities or other
assets to be distributed to the holders of the Common Units pursuant to the
Partnership Event (as applicable, the "Series C Partnership Event Payment").

 

(2) Upon receipt by a Series C Unitholder of a Series C Partnership Event
Change of Control Offer, such Series C Unitholder may elect, by written
notice received by the Partnership no later than five (5) Business Days after
the receipt by such holder of a Series C Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer, to receive Series C Survivor Preferred Securities (as defined below)
pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(G)(2)_ in lieu of a Series C
Partnership Event Payment. Upon receipt of such Series C Unitholders election
to receive Series C Survivor Preferred Securities, the Partnership shall as
promptly as practicable, but in any event prior to the consummation of any
Partnership Event, make appropriate provision to ensure that such electing
holders of Series C Preferred Units receive in such Partnership Event a
preferred security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from such
Partnership Event and containing provisions substantially equivalent to the
provisions set

 



99  forth in this Agreement with respect to the Series C Preferred Units,
including _Section 5.14_ and _Section 7.3_ hereof, without material
abridgement, including, without limitation, the same powers, preferences,
rights to distributions, rights to accumulation and compounding upon failure
to pay distributions, and relative participating, optional or other special
rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the
Series C Preferred Unit had immediately prior to such Partnership Event (the
"Series C Survivor Preferred Security"). The Series C Conversion Rate in
effect at the time of the effective date of such Partnership Event shall be
proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of a unit of Series C Survivor
Preferred Security after such time shall entitle the holder to the number of
securities or amount of cash or other assets which, if a Series C Preferred
Unit had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such
Partnership Event, such holder would have been entitled to receive immediately
following such Partnership Event. Subsequent adjustments to the Series C
Conversion Rate of the Series C Survivor Preferred Security shall be made
successively thereafter whenever any event described in _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(E)_, _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(F)_ or this _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(G)_ shall occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership
may consummate a Partnership Event without making appropriate provision to
ensure that the holders of Series C Preferred Units receive a Series C
Partnership Event Payment or Series C Survivor Preferred Security, as
applicable, with respect to such Partnership Event if prior to such
consummation the Partnership has received the prior written approval of the
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series C Preferred Units.

 

(3) A Series C Partnership Event Change of Control Offer shall be mailed to
each Series C Unitholder and shall describe the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Partnership Event and state:

i) that the Series C Partnership Event Change of Control Offer is being made
pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(F)_ and that the Partnership is
making an offer to redeem all Series C Preferred Units of such Unitholder
(subject to the consummation of the Partnership Event); 

ii) the amount of the Series C Partnership Event Payment and the redemption
date, which shall be the date on which the Partnership Event is consummated
or as soon thereafter as practicable (the "Series C Partnership Event Payment
Date"); and

 

iii) the amount per Common Unit that each Common Unitholder is receiving in
connection with the Partnership Event.

 



100 On the Series C Partnership Event Payment Date, the Partnership (or its
successor) shall pay to each Unitholder of Series C Preferred Units that
accepts the Series C Partnership Event Change of Control Offer an amount in
cash equal to such holders applicable Series C Partnership Event Payment, and
all of such holders rights and privileges under the Series C Preferred Units
or as a Series C Unitholder shall be extinguished.

(H) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this _Section
5.14(b)(viii)_, no adjustment shall be made to the Series C Conversion Rate
pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(E)-(G)_ as a result of any of the
following:

 

(1) the grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase
Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise of any such
options, warrants or rights to employees, officers or directors of the General
Partner or the Partnership and its Subsidiaries in respect of services
provided to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries,
under compensation plans and agreements approved in good faith by the General
Partner (including any Long Term Incentive Plan); provided that, in the case
of options, warrants or rights to purchase Common Units, the exercise price
per Common Unit shall not be less than the Closing Price on the date such
option, warrant or other right is issued;

(2) the issuance of any Common Units as all or part of the consideration to
effect (i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets of an
unrelated third party in an arms-length transaction or (ii) the consummation
of a merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Partnership
with or into another entity to the extent such transaction(s) is or are
validly approved by the vote or consent of the General Partner; and

 

(3) the issuance of Partnership Interests for which an adjustment is made
under another provision of this  _Section 5.14(b)(viii)_.

(I) The following rules shall apply for purposes of this  _Section
5.14(b)(viii)_:

(1) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of Common
Units for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash
paid therefor before deducting any reasonable underwriting discounts or
placement agent fees, commissions or the expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
the Partnership for any underwriting or placement agent or otherwise in
connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(2) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of
Common Units for consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be valued at the Agreed Value thereof;

 



101 (3) In the case of the issuance or sale of Convertible Securities, the
following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(I)_:

i) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon exercise
(assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including,
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of options or warrants to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Units shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such options, warrants or rights were issued and for consideration
equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in this 
_Section 5.14(b)(viii)(I)_), if any, received by the Partnership upon the
issuance of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price
provided in such options, warrants or rights (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Units covered thereby.

ii) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon conversion
of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage
of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the
exercise of options or warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were
issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Partnership for any such
securities or options, warrants or rights, plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by the Partnership (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights and
subsequent conversion or exchange of the underlying convertible or
exchangeable securities, as appropriate (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)_).

 



102 iii) In the event of any change in (x) the number of Common Units deliverable
or (y) the consideration payable to the Partnership upon exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to either Common Units or such
convertible or exchangeable securities or upon conversion of or in exchange
for such convertible or exchangeable securities and not otherwise entitled to
any appropriate antidilution adjustment pursuant to this _Section 5.14_,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Series C Conversion Rate, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be
made for the actual issuance of Common Units or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

 

iv) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights with respect
to either Common Units or such convertible or exchangeable securities or the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, the Series C Conversion
Rate, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options,
warrants, rights or securities shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of Common Units actually issued upon the exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to Common Units, upon the conversion
or exchange of such securities, or the number of Common Units issuable
upon conversion or exchange of the convertible or exchangeable securities
that were actually issued upon exercise of options, warrants or rights related
to such securities.

 

v) The number of Common Units deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid
therefor pursuant to  _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(I)(3)i)_ and _ii)_ shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(I)(3)iii) or iv)_.

 

(4) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this _Section
5.14(b)(viii)(I)_, no adjustment shall be made to the number of Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Units or the Series C
Conversion Rate as a result of an event for which an adjustment is made under
another provision of this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(I)_.

 



103 (5) For purposes of this _Section 5.14(b)(viii)_, no adjustment to
the Series C Conversion Rate shall be made in an amount less than 1/100th of
one cent per Unit; _provided_ that any adjustments that are not required to be
made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment made.

(J) In the event of any taking by the Partnership of a Record Date of the
holders of any class of Partnership Interests for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any distribution thereon, any
security or right convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive
additional Common Units, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any Partnership Interests or any other securities or property of the
Partnership, or to receive any other right, the Partnership shall notify each
holder of Series C Preferred Units at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Record Date, of which any such Record Date is to be taken for the purpose of
such distribution, security or right and the amount and character of such
distribution, security or right; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing
requirement shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any holder of Series C
Preferred Units if at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Record Date, the
Partnership shall have issued a press release which shall be posted on the
Partnerships website and carried by one or more wire services, containing the
required information.

 

(K) The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise, property or similar taxes, that may
be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of Series C Conversion Units on
conversion of, or payment of distributions on, Series C Preferred Units
pursuant hereto. _However_ , the holder of any Series C Preferred Units shall
pay any tax that is due because the Series C Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion thereof or distribution payment thereon are issued in a name other
than such Series C Unitholders name.

 

(L) The Partnership agrees that it will act in good faith to make any
adjustment(s) required by this  _Section 5.14(b)(viii)_ equitably and in
such a manner as to afford the Series C Unitholders the benefits of the
provisions hereof, and will not take any action that could reasonably be
expected to deprive such Series C Unitholders of the benefit hereof.

(ix) Reserved.

 

(x) _Tax Estimates_. Upon receipt of a written request from any Series C
Unitholder stating the number of Series C Preferred Units owned by such
holder (which requests shall be made no more than two (2) times per calendar
year and the first such request per calendar year shall be at the
Partnerships expense, and the second at the expense of such requesting
holder), the Partnership shall, within ten (10) days, provide such Series C
Unitholder with a good faith estimate (and reasonable supporting calculations)
of whether there is sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to the
Partnership 

 



104  property such that, if such Series C Unitholder converted its Series C
Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(A)_ and such Unrealized
Gain was allocated to such holder pursuant to _Section 5.5 (d)(iii)_, such
holders Capital Account in respect of its converted Series C Preferred Units
would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common
Unit (other than a Series C Conversion Unit received in connection with such
conversion of a Series C Preferred Unit).

(xi) _Fully Paid and Nonassessable_. Any Series C Conversion Unit(s)
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ shall be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act), free
and clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than those
arising under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the holders
thereof.

 

(xii) _Listing of Common Units_. The Partnership will procure, at its sole
expense, the listing of the Series C Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion of the Series C Preferred Units, subject to issuance or notice of
issuance on any National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are
listed or admitted to trading.

 

(c) _Call Right on Series C Convertible Preferred Units_. At any time which
shall be no later than 10 days or earlier than 30 days before April 24, 2017,
the Partnership may exercise the right (the "Series C Call Right"), but shall
have no obligation, to require the holder or holders of the Series C Preferred
Units (the "Series C Holders") to sell, assign and transfer all or a portion
of the then outstanding Series C Preferred Units to the Partnership in
accordance with this _Section 5.14(c)_. The Partnership may exercise the
Series C Call Right with respect to any Series C Preferred Unit unless: (A)
the exercise of the Series C Call Right would result in a default under any
applicable financing agreements, or other financing obligations of the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or would otherwise be prohibited by any
securities or other applicable law, or (B) a Series C Holder has delivered, on
or prior to the date of the Series C Call Exercise Notice (as defined below),
a Series C Conversion Notice with respect to such Series C Preferred Unit
(and then no Series C Call Right may be made as to such Series C Preferred
Unit).

(i) Reserved.

 

(ii) The purchase price to be paid by the Partnership in connection with the
exercise of the Series C Call Right shall be the Series C Adjusted Issue
Price, plus any Series C Unpaid Cash Distributions per Series C Preferred Unit
acquired pursuant to the Series C Call Right (subject to appropriate
adjustment for any equity distribution, subdivision or combination
of Partnership Interests).

(iii) If the Partnership elects to exercise the Series C Call Right, the
Partnership shall deliver a written notice (the "Series C Call Exercise
Notice") to the Series C Holders informing the Series C Holders of the
Partnerships intention to exercise its Series C Call Right. The Series C Call
Exercise Notice shall include a certificate in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Annex D_ , setting forth (A) the number of Series C
Preferred Units held by each Series C Holder, (B) the number of Series C
Preferred Units with respect to which the Series C Call Right is being
exercised, (C) the bank

 



105  account information for wire transfer of the purchase price or address for
delivery of the purchase price by check, and (D) the closing date for the
purchase (the "Series C Call Closing Date"), which shall be no earlier than
10 days or later than 30 days after the date of the Series C Call Exercise
Notice. If any Series C Holder does not notify the Partnership of a change to
the bank account information or address for delivery of the purchase prices
set forth in _Annex D_ prior to the date that is two days before the Series C
Call Closing Date, the Partnership shall wire or deliver to each Series C
Holder its portion of the purchase price in immediately available funds to
such bank account or address set forth on _Annex D_.

(iv) The Series C Call Right may be exercised as to any portion of the
outstanding Series C Preferred Units outstanding at the time a Series C Call
Exercise Notice is delivered, but must be exercised pro-rata as to all Series
C Preferred Units subject to the Series C Call Right.

(v) At the closing of the Series C Call Right, (A) the Partnership shall
deliver to each Series C Holder subject thereto a certificate executed on
behalf of the Partnership in the form attached hereto as _Annex E_ , and (B)
each such Series C Holder shall deliver to the Partnership a certificate
executed by such Series C Holder in the form attached hereto as _Annex F_ ,
the certificates representing the Series C Preferred Units with transfer
powers, executed in blank, or, if uncertificated, transfer powers executed in
blank, and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by the
Partnership.

Section 5.15 _Establishment of Series D Preferred Units_.

 

(a) _General_. The Partnership hereby designates and creates a series of Units
to be designated as "Series D Preferred Units" and consisting of a total of
2,333,333 Series D Preferred Units, having the same rights, preferences and
privileges, and subject to the same duties and obligations, as the Common
Units, except as set forth in this  _Section 5.15_, _Section 6.10_, and
_Section 12.9_. The Series D Preferred Units shall be considered pari passu
as to allocations and distributions with the Series A Preferred Units, Series
C Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units. Immediately following the
Series D Issuance Date and thereafter, no additional Series D Preferred Units
shall be designated, created or issued without the prior written approval of
the General Partner and the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series D
Preferred Units.

(b) _Rights of Series D Preferred Units_. The Series D Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and shall be subject to
the following duties and obligations:

(i)  _Allocations_.

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(a)_, (x)
following any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ and prior to
any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_, any Net Income shall be
allocated to all Unitholders holding Series D Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until
the aggregate of the Net Income allocated to such Unitholders pursuant to
this _Section_

 



106   _5.15(b)(i)(A)_ for the current and all previous taxable periods since
issuance of the Series D Preferred Units is equal to the aggregate amount of
cash distributed with respect to such Series D Preferred Units for the
current and previous taxable periods and (y) in no event shall any Net Income
be allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_ in respect of Series D
Preferred Units. Allocations to Series D Preferred Units pursuant to this
_Section 5.15(b)(i)(A)_, to the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.12(b)(i)(A)_, to the Series C Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.14(b)(i)(A)_ and to the Series E Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)(i)(A)_ shall be made Pro Rata.

(B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(b)_, (x)
Unitholders holding Series D Preferred Units shall not receive any allocation
pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ with respect to their Series D Preferred
Units, and (y) following any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_
and prior to any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_, Net Losses
shall be allocated to all Unitholders holding Series D Preferred Units, Pro
Rata, until the Adjusted Capital Account of each such Unitholder in respect
of each Outstanding Series D Preferred Unit has been reduced to zero.
Allocations to Series D Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section 5.15
(b)(i)(B)_, to the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to  _Section
5.12(b)(i)(B)_, to the Series C Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.14(b)(i)(B)_ and to the Series E Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)(i)(B)_ shall be made Pro Rata.

 

(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(c)(i)_, (x)
Unitholders holding Series D Preferred Units shall not receive any allocation
pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(i)_ with respect to their Series D Preferred
Units, and (y) following any allocation made pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(i)(A)_ and prior to any allocation made pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(i)(B)_, any remaining Net Termination Gain shall be allocated to all
Unitholders holding Series D Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital
Account in respect of each Outstanding Series D Preferred Unit is equal to
the Series D Liquidation Value. Allocations to Series D Preferred Units
pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)(i)(C)_, to the Series A Preferred Units
pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(i)(C)_, to the Series C Preferred
Units pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(i)(C)_ and to the Series E Preferred
Units pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(i)(C)_ shall be made Pro Rata.

 

(D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_, (x)

pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_ with respect to their Series D Preferred
Units, and (y) following the allocations made pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(ii)(C)_, and prior to any allocation made pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(ii)(D)_, any remaining Net Termination Loss shall be allocated to all
Unitholders holding Series D Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Adjusted
Capital Account in respect of each Outstanding Series D Preferred Unit has
been reduced to zero. Allocations to Series D Preferred Units pursuant to this
_Section 5.15(b)(i)(D)_, to the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.12(b)(i)(D)_, to the Series C Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)(i)(D)_ and to the Series E Preferred Units pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)(i)(D)_ shall be made Pro Rata.

 



107 (ii) _Distributions_.

 

(A) Commencing with the Quarter ending on December 31, 2016, the holders of
the Series D Preferred Units Outstanding as of an applicable Record Date
shall be entitled to receive cumulative distributions (each, a "Series D
Quarterly Distribution"), prior to any other distributions made in respect of
any Junior Interests pursuant to  _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, in the
amount set forth in this _Section 5.15(b)(ii)(A)_ in respect of each
Outstanding Series D Preferred Unit. All such distributions shall be paid
Quarterly within forty-five (45) days after the end of each Quarter (each
such payment date, a "Series D Distribution Payment Date"). For the Quarter
ending December 31, 2016, and for each Quarter thereafter through and
including the Quarter ending immediately prior to the Series D Conversion
Date, the Series D Quarterly Distributions shall be paid entirely in cash at
the Series D Distribution Rate per Series D Preferred Unit. If the Partnership
establishes a Record Date for any distribution to be made by the Partnership
on other Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_,
then the Record Date established pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)(ii)(A)_
for a Series D Quarterly Distribution in respect of any Quarter shall be the
same Record Date established for any distribution to be made by the
Partnership in respect of distributions on other Partnership Interests
pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_ for such Quarter.

(B) Beginning with the Quarter ending December 31, 2016, if in violation of
this Agreement, the Partnership fails to pay in full any Series D Quarterly
Distribution when due, then, without limiting any rights of the holders of the
Series D Preferred Units to compel the Partnership to make such distribution,
from and after the first date of such failure and continuing until such
failure is cured by payment in full in cash of all arrearages with respect to
any Series D Quarterly Distribution, including accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, (w) the amount of such unpaid distributions ("Series D Unpaid Cash
Distributions") will accrue and accumulate from and including the first day of
the Quarter immediately following the Quarter in respect of which such payment
is due until paid in full, (x) any Series D Unpaid Cash Distribution shall
accrue interest from the applicable Series D Distribution Payment Date at rate
equal to 6.00% per annum, and (y) the Partnership shall not be permitted to,
and shall not, declare or make (i) any distributions in respect of any Junior
Interests and (ii) any distributions in respect of any Series D Parity
Securities.

 

(C) The aggregate amount of cash to be distributed in respect of the Series D
Preferred Units Outstanding as of the Record Date for such Series D Quarterly
Distribution shall be paid out of Available Cash prior to making any
distribution pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_. To the extent that
any portion of a Series D Quarterly Distribution to be paid in cash with
respect to any Quarter, together with any portion of a Series A Quarterly
Distribution, a Series C

 



108  Quarterly Distribution and a Series E Quarterly Distribution to be paid in
cash with respect to such Quarter, exceeds the amount of Available Cash for
such Quarter, an amount of cash equal to the Available Cash for such Quarter
will be paid to the Series A Unitholders, the Series C Unitholders, the Series
D Unitholders and the Series E Unitholders Pro Rata and the balance of such
Series D Quarterly Distribution (and Series A Quarterly Distribution, Series
C Quarterly Distribution and Series E Quarterly Distribution) shall be unpaid
and shall constitute an arrearage and accrue interest as set forth in _Section
5.15(b)(ii)(B)_. The Partnership shall provide written notice to the Series D
Unitholders, not later than the last Business Day of the month immediately
following the end of such Quarter, describing in reasonable detail the
Partnerships calculation of Available Cash for such Quarter and the portion,
if any, of the Series D Quarterly Distribution the Partnership will be unable
to pay on the applicable Series D Distribution Payment Date.

 

(D) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.15(b)(ii)_ to the contrary,
with respect to Series D Preferred Units that are converted into Common
Units, the holder thereof shall not be entitled to a Series D Preferred Unit
distribution and a Common Unit distribution with respect to the same period,
but shall be entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the
class of Units held as of the close of business on the applicable Record Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, if a Series D Conversion Notice Date occurs prior
to the close of business on a Record Date for payment of a distribution on
the Common Units, the applicable holder of Series D Preferred Units shall
receive only the Common Unit distribution with respect to such period.

 

(E) Notwithstanding anything in _Article VI_ to the contrary, neither the
General Partner nor the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights shall be
entitled to receive distributions or allocations of income or gain that
correspond or relate to amounts distributed or allocated to Unitholders in
respect of Series D Preferred Units, regardless of whether the amounts
so distributed or allocated in respect of the Series D Preferred Units were
determined under clause (ii) of the definition of "Series D Distribution Rate"
or were otherwise determined on an "as converted" basis.

 

(iii) _Issuance of Series D Preferred Units and Series D Warrant_. The Series
D Preferred Units shall be issued by the Partnership pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Series D Unit Purchase Agreement. If, on the Series D
Warrant Start Date, any Series D Preferred Units remain outstanding, the
Partnership shall issue promptly thereafter the Series D Warrant to the
Record Holders of the Series D Preferred Units (in proportion to their
relative number of Series D Preferred Units) as of the Series D Warrant Start
Date.

 

(iv) _Liquidation Value_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Partnership under  _Section 12.4_ or a sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, either voluntary or involuntary, the Record Holders of the Series
D Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive, out of the

 



109  assets of the Partnership available for distribution to the Partners or any
assignees, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the
Partnership to the Record Holders of any other class or series of Partnership
Interests (other than Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred Units or
Series E Preferred Units as to which the Series D Preferred Units are pari
passu), the positive value in each such holders Capital Account in respect
of such Series D Preferred Units. If in the year of such liquidation and
winding up, or sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Partnership, any such Record Holders Capital Account in
respect of such Series D Preferred Units is less than the aggregate Series D
Liquidation Value of such Series D Preferred Units, then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and prior to any other
allocation pursuant to this Agreement for such year and prior to any
distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, items of gross income and
gain shall be allocated to all Unitholders then holding Series D Preferred
Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of each Outstanding
Series D Preferred Unit is equal to the Series D Liquidation Value (and no
other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such
allocation), with such allocation being made Pro Rata with any allocation
made pursuant to the second sentences of _Section 5.12(b)(iv)_, _Section
5.14(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_. If in the year of such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up any such Record Holders Capital Account in respect
of such Series D Preferred Units is less than the aggregate Series D
Liquidation Value of such Series D Preferred Units after the application of
the preceding sentence, then to the extent permitted by applicable law
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
items of gross income and gain for any preceding taxable period(s) with
respect to which IRS Form 1065 Schedules K-1 have not been filed by the
Partnership shall be reallocated to all Unitholders then holding Series D
Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of each such
Outstanding Series D Preferred Unit after making allocations pursuant to this
and the immediately preceding sentence is equal to the Series D Liquidation
Value (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the
effect of such allocation), with such allocation being made Pro Rata with any
allocation made pursuant to the third sentences of  _Section 5.12(b)(iv)_,
_Section 5.14(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_. At such time as such
allocations have been made to the Outstanding Series D Preferred Units, any
remaining Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss shall be allocated to
the Partners pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_, as the case
may be. At the time of the dissolution of the Partnership, subject to Section
17-804 of the Delaware Act, the Record Holders of the Series D Preferred
Units shall become entitled to receive any distributions in respect of the
Series D Preferred Units that are accrued and unpaid as of the date of such
distribution in priority over any entitlement of any other Partners or
Assignees with respect to any distributions by the Partnership to such other
Partners or Assignees (other than Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred
Units and Series E Preferred Units as to which the Series D Preferred Units
are pari passu); _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner, as such,
will have no liability for any obligations with respect to such distributions
to any Record Holder(s) of Series D Preferred Units.

 



110 (v) _Voting Rights_.

 

(A) Except as provided in _Section 5.15(b)(v)(B)_ below, the Outstanding
Series D Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the
voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a
single class, so that each Outstanding Series D Preferred Unit will be
entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series D Preferred
Unit is then convertible on each matter with respect to which each Common Unit
is entitled to vote. Each reference in this Agreement to a vote of Record
Holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of
Common Units, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Units, Series C Preferred
Units, Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units on an "as if"
converted basis, and the definition of "Unit Majority" shall correspondingly
be construed to mean at least a majority of the Common Units, the Series A
Preferred Units, the Series B Units, the Series C Preferred Units, Series D
Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units, on an "as if" converted basis,
voting together as a single class during any period in which any Series D
Preferred Units are Outstanding.

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series D Preferred Units, voting separately as a
class based upon one vote per Series D Preferred Unit, shall be necessary on
any matter (including a merger, consolidation or business combination) that
adversely affects any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series
D Preferred Units or amends or modifies any of the terms of the Series D
Preferred Units; provided that the Partnership shall be able to amend this
_Section 5.15_ without the approval by the Record Holders of Outstanding
Series D Preferred Units so long as the amendment does not adversely affect
the holders of the Series D Preferred Units in any material respect and does
not affect the holders of the Series D Preferred Units disproportionately
in relation to the holders of Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership may, without the consent or approval of the Record Holders of
Outstanding Series D Preferred Units, create (by reclassification or
otherwise) and issue Junior Interests (including by amending the provisions
of any existing class of Partnership Interests to make such class of
Partnership Interests a class of Junior Interests) in an unlimited amount.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any action shall
be deemed to adversely affect the holders of the Series D Preferred Units in a
material respect if such action would:

 

(1) reduce the Series D Distribution Rate, change the form of payment of
distributions on the Series D Preferred Units, defer the date from which
distributions on the Series D Preferred Units will accrue, cancel accrued and
unpaid distributions on the Series D Preferred Units or any interest accrued
thereon, or change the seniority rights of the Series D Unitholders as to the
payment of distributions in relation to the Unitholders of any other class or
series of Units or, except as determined to be appropriate in connection with
the issuance of Junior Interests, amend this _Section 5.15_;

 



111 (2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the holders
of the Series D Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets, of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation
preferences of the holders of the Series D Preferred Units in relation to the
rights upon liquidation of the holders of any other class or series of Units;
or

 

(3) result in a Preferred Unit Change of Control.

 

(vi) _No Series D Parity Securities or Series D Senior Securities_. The
Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series D Preferred Units, issue any Series D
Parity Securities or Series D Senior Securities.

 

(vii) _Certificates_.

 

(A) The Series D Preferred Units shall be evidenced by Certificates in such
form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of
any applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned
or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign the
responsibility to another Person, the Partnership will act as the registrar
and transfer agent for the Series D Preferred Units. The Certificates
evidencing Series D Preferred Units shall be separately identified and shall
not bear the same CUSIP number as the Certificates evidencing Common Units.

(B) The certificate(s) representing the Series D Preferred Units may be
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form (but, if
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, may refer to the Fifth A/R
Partnership Agreement):

 

"NEITHER THE OFFER NOR SALE OF THESE SECURITIES HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER AND, IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION
EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION, UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT OR
THE PARTNERSHIP HAS RECEIVED DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT
SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT. THIS SECURITY
IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE SIXTH AMENDED
AND RESTATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP, DATED AS OF
[], 2017, AS AMENDED, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PARTNERSHIP AT
ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

 



112 (viii) _Conversion_.

 

(A) _At the Option of the Series D Unitholder_. At any time and from time to
time after the Series D Optional Conversion Start Date, subject to any
applicable limitations in the New Credit Agreement and subject to no Series D
Call Exercise Notice having been given, the Series D Preferred Units owned by
any Series D Unitholder shall be convertible, in whole or in part, upon the
request of the Series D Unitholder into a number of Common Units determined by
multiplying the number of Series D Preferred Units to be converted by the
Series D Conversion Rate. Immediately upon any conversion of Series D
Preferred Units, all rights of the Series D Converting Unitholder in respect
thereof shall cease, including, without limitation, any accrual of
distributions, and such Series D Converting Unitholder shall be treated for
all purposes as the owner of Common Units. Fractional Common Units shall not
be issued to any person pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(A)_ (each
fractional Common Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Common Unit (and
a 0.5 Common Unit shall be rounded up to the next higher Common Unit)).

(B) _Conversion Notice_. To convert Series D Preferred Units into Common Units
pursuant to  _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(A)_, the Series D Unitholder shall give
written notice (a "Series D Conversion Notice") to the Partnership in the form
of Exhibit E attached hereto stating that such Series D Unitholder elects to
so convert Series D Preferred Units and shall state therein with respect to
Series D Preferred Units to be converted pursuant to _Section
5.15(b)(viii)(A)_ the following: (a) the number of Series D Preferred Units to
be converted, (b) the Certificate(s) evidencing the Series D Preferred Units
to be converted and duly endorsed, (c) the name or names in which such Series
D Unitholder wishes the Certificate or Certificates for Series D Conversion
Units to be issued, and (d) the Series D Unitholders computation of the
number of Series D Conversion Units to be received by such Series D Unitholder
(or designated recipient(s)) upon the Series D Conversion Date. The date any
Series D Conversion Notice is received by the Partnership shall be
hereinafter be referred to as a "Series D Conversion Notice Date."

 

(C) _Timing; Certificates_. If a Series D Conversion Notice is delivered by a
Series D Unitholder to the Partnership, in accordance with _Section
5.15(b)(viii)(B)_, the Partnership shall issue the Series D Conversion Units
no later than seven (7) days after a Series D Conversion Notice Date (any date
of issuance of such Common Units, a "Series D Conversion Date"). On the
Series D Conversion Date, the Partnership shall issue to such Series D
Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) a Certificate or Certificates for the
number of Series D Conversion Units to which such holder shall be entitled.
In lieu of delivering physical Certificates representing the Series D
Conversion Units issuable upon conversion of Series D Preferred Units,
provided the Transfer Agent is

 



113  participating in the Depositorys Fast Automated Securities Transfer
program, upon request of the Series D Unitholder, the Partnership shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Transfer Agent to
electronically transmit the Series D Conversion Units issuable upon conversion
or distribution payment to such Series D Unitholder (or designated
recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the Series D Unitholder (or
designated recipient(s)) prime broker with the Depository through its Deposit
Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The parties agree to coordinate with the
Depository to accomplish this objective. Upon issuance of Series D Conversion
Units to the Series D Converting Unitholder, all rights under the converted
Series D Preferred Units shall cease, and such Series D Converting Unitholder
shall be treated for all purposes as the Record Holder of such Series D
Conversion Units.

 

(D) _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership_. If the Partnership (i) makes a distribution on its Common Units
in Common Units, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units into a
greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its Common
Units into a smaller number of Common Units, or (iv) issues by
reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any
reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or business
combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person), then the
Series D Conversion Rate in effect at the time of the Record Date for such
distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination, or
reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of
the Series D Preferred Units after such time shall entitle each Series D
Unitholder to receive the aggregate number of Common Units (or any Partnership
Interests into which such Common Units would have been combined, consolidated,
merged or reclassified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) above) that such
Series D Unitholder would have been entitled to receive if the Series D
Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such
Record Date or effective date, as the case may be, and in the case of a
merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the
surviving Person, the Partnership shall provide effective provisions to ensure
that the provisions in this _Section 5.15_ relating to the Series D
Preferred Units shall not be abridged or amended and that the Series D
Preferred Units shall thereafter retain the same powers, preferences and
relative participating, optional and other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, that the Series D
Preferred Units had immediately prior to such transaction or event. An
adjustment made pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(D)_ shall become
effective immediately after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and
shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a
subdivision, combination, reclassification (including any reclassification in
connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the
Partnership is the surviving Person) or split. Such adjustment shall be made
successively whenever any event described above shall occur.

 



114 If, in the future, the Partnership issues any Convertible Securities, the
General Partner shall, at the direction and at the option of the holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series D Preferred Units in their sole discretion,
either (i) amend the provisions of this Agreement relating to antidilution
protection to (A) revise any such provision that is less favorable than the
corresponding provision offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities
(or any related purchase agreement) so that such provision is the same as such
provision offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities (or any related
purchase agreement) and (B) incorporate any provision(s) offered in the terms
of such Convertible Securities (or any related purchase agreement) that is not
currently provided for in this Agreement and which would make the
antidilution protection provisions of this Agreement more favorable to the
holders of Series D Preferred Units, which amendment shall be effective
concurrently with the issuance and/or execution of documentation relating to
such Convertible Securities, or (ii) retain the antidilution language
applicable to the Series D Preferred Units at such time. The Partnership
agrees to provide as much prior notice of the proposed issuance of any such
Convertible Securities and/or execution of documentation relating to such
issuance of Convertible Securities as is reasonably practicable (and in any
event, such notice shall be provided at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
such issuance and/or execution).

 

(E) _Follow-On Adjustments_. Except in connection with the exercise of a
Warrant, if the Partnership shall issue or sell or grant any Follow-on Units
at a Follow-on Price that is less than one hundred percent (100%) of the
Series D Adjusted Issue Price, then the Series D Conversion Rate will be reset
so that it will equal the number determined by dividing the Series D Adjusted
Issue Price immediately before the issuance of the Follow-On Units by the
result achieved through application of the following formula:

 

((CP x OB) + (FP x Q)) / OA

 

Where:

CP = the Series D Adjusted Issue Price in effect immediately before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

FP = the Follow-On Price

 

OB = the total number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

 

Q = the total number of fully diluted Follow-On Units issued

 

OA = the total number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding after giving
effect to the issuance of the Follow-On Units.

 



115 For purposes of this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(E)_, the indicative price per
Common Unit resulting from the issuance of Convertible Securities will be
determined using the principles set forth in _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(H)(3)_.

 

(F) _Other Extraordinary Transactions Affecting the Partnership_.

 

(1) Prior to the consummation of a Partnership Event, the Partnership shall,
as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than twelve (12)
Business Days prior to the consummation of the Partnership Event, make an
irrevocable written offer (a "Series D Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer"), subject to consummation of the Partnership Event, to each holder of
Series D Preferred Units to redeem all (but not less than all) of such
holders Series D Preferred Units for a price per Series D Preferred Unit
payable in cash equal to the greater of (x) the sum of the Series D Issue
Price and the Series D Unpaid Cash Distributions and (y) an amount equal to
the product of (1) the number of Common Units into which each Series D
Preferred Unit is convertible pursuant to _Section 5.15(b)(viii)_ on the
day immediately prior to the date of the Series D Partnership Event Change of
Control Offer and (2) the sum of (A) the cash consideration per Common Unit to
be paid to the holders of Common Units pursuant to the Partnership Event
plus (B) the fair market value per Common Unit of the securities or other
assets to be distributed to the holders of the Common Units pursuant to the
Partnership Event (as applicable, the "Series D Partnership Event Payment").

 

(2) Upon receipt by a Series D Unitholder of a Series D Partnership Event
Change of Control Offer, such Series D Unitholder may elect, by written
notice received by the Partnership no later than five (5) Business Days after
the receipt by such holder of a Series D Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer, to receive Series D Survivor Preferred Securities (as defined below)
pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(F)(2)_ in lieu of a Series D
Partnership Event Payment. Upon receipt of such Series D Unitholders election
to receive Series D Survivor Preferred Securities, the Partnership shall as
promptly as practicable, but in any event prior to the consummation of any
Partnership Event, make appropriate provision to ensure that such electing
holders of Series D Preferred Units receive in such Partnership Event a
preferred security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from such
Partnership Event and containing provisions substantially equivalent to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Series D Preferred
Units, including  _Section 5.15_ and _Section 7.3_ hereof, without material
abridgement, including, without limitation, the same powers, preferences,
rights to distributions, rights to accumulation and compounding upon failure
to pay distributions, and relative participating, optional or other special
rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the
Series D Preferred Unit had immediately prior to such Partnership Event (the 

 



116  "Series D Survivor Preferred Security"). The Series D Conversion Rate in
effect at the time of the effective date of such Partnership Event shall be
proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of a unit of Series D
Survivor Preferred Security after such time shall entitle the holder to the
number of securities or amount of cash or other assets which, if a Series D
Preferred Unit had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such
Partnership Event, such holder would have been entitled to receive immediately
following such Partnership Event. Subsequent adjustments to the Series D
Conversion Rate of the Series D Survivor Preferred Security shall be made
successively thereafter whenever any event described in _Section
5.15(b)(viii)(D)_, _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(E)_ or this _Section 5.15
(b)(viii)(F)_ shall occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership
may consummate a Partnership Event without making appropriate provision to
ensure that the holders of Series D Preferred Units receive a Series D
Partnership Event Payment or Series D Survivor Preferred Security, as
applicable, with respect to such Partnership Event if prior to such
consummation the Partnership has received the prior written approval of the
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series D Preferred Units.

 

(3) A Series D Partnership Event Change of Control Offer shall be mailed to
each Series D Unitholder and shall describe the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Partnership Event and state:

i) that the Series D Partnership Event Change of Control Offer is being made
pursuant to this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(F)_ and that the Partnership is
making an offer to redeem all Series D Preferred Units of such Unitholder
(subject to the consummation of the Partnership Event); 

ii) the amount of the Series D Partnership Event Payment and the redemption
date, which shall be the date on which the Partnership Event is consummated
or as soon thereafter as practicable (the "Series D Partnership Event Payment
Date"); and

 

iii) the amount per Common Unit that each Common Unitholder is receiving in
connection with the Partnership Event.

 

On the Series D Partnership Event Payment Date, the Partnership (or its
successor) shall pay to each Unitholder of Series D Preferred Units that
accepts the Series D Partnership Event Change of Control Offer an amount in
cash equal to such holders applicable Series D Partnership Event Payment, and
all of such holders rights and privileges under the Series D Preferred
Units or as a Series D Unitholder shall be extinguished.

 



117 (G) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this  _Section
5.15(b)(viii)_, no adjustment shall be made to the Series D Conversion Rate
pursuant to _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(D)-(F)_ as a result of any of the
following:

 

(1) the grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase
Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise of any such
options, warrants or rights to employees, officers or directors of the General
Partner or the Partnership and its Subsidiaries in respect of services
provided to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries,
under compensation plans and agreements approved in good faith by the General
Partner (including any Long Term Incentive Plan); provided that, in the case
of options, warrants or rights to purchase Common Units, the exercise price
per Common Unit shall not be less than the Closing Price on the date such
option, warrant or other right is issued;

(2) the issuance of any Common Units as all or part of the consideration to
effect (i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets of an
unrelated third party in an arms-length transaction or (ii) the consummation
of a merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Partnership
with or into another entity to the extent such transaction(s) is or are
validly approved by the vote or consent of the General Partner; and

 

(3) the issuance of Partnership Interests for which an adjustment is made
under another provision of this  _Section 5.15(b)(viii)_.

(H) The following rules shall apply for purposes of this  _Section
5.15(b)(viii)_:

(1) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of Common
Units for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash
paid therefor before deducting any reasonable underwriting discounts or
placement agent fees, commissions or the expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
the Partnership for any underwriting or placement agent or otherwise in
connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(2) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of
Common Units for consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be valued at the Agreed Value thereof.

 



118 (3) In the case of the issuance or sale of Convertible Securities, the
following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this _Section
5.15(b)(viii)(H)_:

i) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon exercise
(assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including,
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of options or warrants to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Units shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such options, warrants or rights were issued and for consideration
equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in this 
_Section 5.15(b)(viii)(H)_), if any, received by the Partnership upon the
issuance of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price
provided in such options, warrants or rights (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Units covered thereby.

ii) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon conversion
of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage
of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution
adjustments) for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the
exercise of options or warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were
issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration
equal to the consideration, if any, received by the Partnership for any such
securities or options, warrants or rights, plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by the Partnership (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of
such securities or upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights and
subsequent conversion or exchange of the underlying convertible or
exchangeable securities, as appropriate (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)_).

 

iii) In the event of any change in (x) the number of Common Units deliverable
or (y) the consideration payable to the Partnership upon exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to either Common Units or such
convertible or exchangeable securities or upon conversion of or in exchange
for such convertible or exchangeable securities and not otherwise entitled to
any appropriate antidilution adjustment pursuant to this _Section 5.15_,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from

 



119  the antidilution provisions thereof, the Series D Conversion Rate, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights
or securities, shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further
adjustment shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Units or any
payment of such consideration upon the exercise of any such options, warrants
or rights or the conversion or exchange of such securities. 

iv) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights with respect
to either Common Units or such convertible or exchangeable securities or the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, the Series D Conversion
Rate, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options,
warrants, rights or securities shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of Common Units actually issued upon the exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to Common Units, upon the conversion
or exchange of such securities, or the number of Common Units issuable
upon conversion or exchange of the convertible or exchangeable securities
that were actually issued upon exercise of options, warrants or rights related
to such securities.

 

v) The number of Common Units deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid
therefor pursuant to  _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(H)(3)i)_ and ii) shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(H)(3)iii)_ or _iv)_.

 

(4) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this _Section
5.15(b)(viii)(H)_, no adjustment shall be made to the number of Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Units or the Series D
Conversion Rate as a result of an event for which an adjustment is made under
another provision of this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(H)_.

 

(5) For purposes of this _Section 5.15(b)(viii)_, no adjustment to the Series
D Conversion Rate shall be made in an amount less than 1/100th of one cent
per Unit; _provided_ that any adjustments that are not required to be made by
reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment made.

 



120 (I) In the event of any taking by the Partnership of a Record Date of the
holders of any class of Partnership Interests for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any distribution thereon, any
security or right convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive
additional Common Units, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any Partnership Interests or any other securities or property of the
Partnership, or to receive any other right, the Partnership shall notify each
holder of Series D Preferred Units at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Record Date, of which any such Record Date is to be taken for the purpose of
such distribution, security or right and the amount and character of such
distribution, security or right; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing
requirement shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any holder of Series D
Preferred Units if at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Record Date, the
Partnership shall have issued a press release which shall be posted on the
Partnerships website and carried by one or more wire services, containing the
required information.

 

(J) The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise, property or similar taxes, that may
be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of Series D Conversion Units on
conversion of, or payment of distributions on, Series D Preferred Units
pursuant hereto. _However_ , the holder of any Series D Preferred Units shall
pay any tax that is due because the Series D Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion thereof or distribution payment thereon are issued in a name other
than such Series D Unitholders name.

 

(K) The Partnership agrees that it will act in good faith to make any
adjustment(s) required by this  _Section 5.15(b)(viii)_ equitably and in
such a manner as to afford the Series D Unitholders the benefits of the
provisions hereof, and will not take any action that could reasonably be
expected to deprive such Series D Unitholders of the benefit hereof.

(ix) Reserved.

 

(x) _Tax Estimates_. Upon receipt of a written request from any Series D
Unitholder stating the number of Series D Preferred Units owned by such
holder (which requests shall be made no more than two (2) times per calendar
year and the first such request per calendar year shall be at the
Partnerships expense, and the second at the expense of such requesting
holder), the Partnership shall, within ten (10) days, provide such Series D
Unitholder with a good faith estimate (and reasonable supporting calculations)
of whether there is sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to the
Partnership property such that, if such Series D Unitholder converted its
Series D Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.15(b)(viii)(A)_ and such
Unrealized Gain was allocated to such holder pursuant to _Section
5.5(d)(iii), _such holders Capital Account in respect of its converted
Series D Preferred Units would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Series D Conversion Unit received
in connection with such conversion of a Series D Preferred Unit).

 



121 (xi) _Fully Paid and Nonassessable_. Any Series D Conversion
Unit(s) delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.15_ shall be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected
by matters described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware
Act), free and clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than
those arising under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the
holders thereof.

 

(xii) _Listing of Common Units_. The Partnership will procure, at its sole
expense, the listing of the Series D Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion of the Series D Preferred Units, subject to issuance or notice of
issuance on any National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are
listed or admitted to trading.

 

(c) _Call Right on Series D Preferred Units_. At any time prior to the Series
D Warrant Start Date, the Partnership may exercise the right (the "Series D
Call Right"), but shall have no obligation, to require the holder or holders
of the Series D Preferred Units (the "Series D Holders") to sell, assign and
transfer all or a portion of the then outstanding Series D Preferred Units to
the Partnership in accordance with this _Section 5.15(c)_. The Partnership
may exercise the Series D Call Right with respect to any Series D Preferred
Unit unless the exercise of the Series D Call Right would result in a default
under any applicable financing agreements, or other financing obligations of
the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or would otherwise be prohibited by
any securities or other applicable law.

 

(i) Reserved.

 

(ii) The purchase price to be paid by the Partnership in connection with the
exercise of the Series D Call Right shall be the product of (A) the Series D
Call Value per Series D Preferred Unit to be acquired pursuant to the Series D
Call Right (subject to appropriate adjustment for any equity distribution,
subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests), multiplied by (B) 1.03.

(iii) If the Partnership elects to exercise the Series D Call Right, the
Partnership shall deliver a written notice (the "Series D Call Exercise
Notice") to the Series D Holders informing the Series D Holders of the
Partnerships intention to exercise its Series D Call Right. The Series D Call
Exercise Notice shall be in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit F_ , setting forth (A) the number of Series D Preferred Units held by
each Series D Holder, (B) the number of Series D Preferred Units with respect
to which the Series D Call Right is being exercised, and (C) the address on
the books and records of the Partnership to be used for delivery of the
purchase price by check, and (D) the closing date for the purchase (the
"Series D Call Closing Date"), which shall be no earlier than 10 days or
later than 30 days after the date of the Series D Call Exercise Notice.

 

(iv) The Series D Call Right may be exercised as to any portion of the
outstanding Series D Preferred Units outstanding at the time a Series D Call
Exercise Notice is delivered, but must be exercised pro-rata as to all Series
D Preferred Units subject to the Series D Call Right.

 



122 (v) If any Series D Holder does not notify the Partnership of a change to
the address for delivery of the purchase prices set forth in the Series D
Call Exercise Notice or provide the Partnership with bank account information
for wire transfer prior to the date that is two days before the Series D Call
Closing Date, the Partnership shall deliver to each Series D Holder its
portion of the purchase price in immediately available funds to such address
set forth on the Series D Call Exercise Notice on or before the Series D Call
Closing Date. If any Series D Holder does notify the Partnership of a change
to the address for delivery of the purchase prices set forth in the Series D
Call Exercise Notice or provide the Partnership with bank account information
for wire transfer prior to the date that is two days before the Series D Call
Closing Date, the Partnership shall write or deliver to each Series D Holder
its portion of the purchase price in immediately available funds to such
address or bank account which were provided to the Partnership on or before
the Series D Call Closing Date. At the closing of the Series D Call Right,
each such Series D Holder shall deliver to the Partnership the certificates
representing the Series D Preferred Units to be acquired with transfer powers,
executed in blank, or, if uncertificated, transfer powers executed in blank,
and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by the
Partnership. The failure of any Series D Holder to comply with the preceding
sentence shall not prevent the closing of the Series D Call Right.

Section 5.16 _Establishment of Series E Preferred Units_.

 

(a) _General_. The Partnership hereby designates and creates a series of Units
to be designated as "Series E Preferred Units" and consisting of a total of
4,500,000 Series E Preferred Units, plus any additional Series E Preferred
Units issued in kind as a distribution pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(ii)_
("Series E PIK Preferred Units"), having the same rights, preferences and
privileges, and subject to the same duties and obligations, as the Common
Units, except as set forth in this _Section 5.16_ and in _Section
5.5(d)(i)_, _Section 6.10_, and  _Section 12.9_. The Series E Preferred
Units, whether issued on the Series E Issuance Date or as Series E PIK
Preferred Units, are referred to herein as "Series E Preferred Units." The
Series E Preferred Units shall be considered pari passu as to allocations and
distributions with the Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred Units and
the Series D Preferred Units. Other than with respect to Series E PIK
Preferred Units, immediately following the Series E Issuance Date and
thereafter, no additional Series E Preferred Units shall be designated,
created or issued without the prior written approval of the General Partner
and the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series E Preferred Units.

 

(b) _Rights of Series E Preferred Units_. The Series E Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and shall be subject to
the following duties and obligations:

(i) _Allocations_.

 

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(a)_, (x)
following any allocation made pursuant to  _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ and prior to
any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_, any Net Income shall be
allocated to all Unitholders holding Series E Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until
the aggregate of the Net Income allocated to such Unitholders pursuant to
this _Section 5.16(b)(i)(A)_ for the current and all previous taxable periods
since issuance of the

 



123  Series E Preferred Units is equal to the aggregate amount of cash
distributed with respect to such Series E Preferred Units for the current and
previous taxable periods and (y) in no event shall any Net Income be
allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_ in respect of Series E Preferred

respect of each Outstanding Series E Preferred Unit has been reduced to zero.

124 (ii) _Distributions_.

 

(A) Commencing with the Quarter ending on [ _December 31, 2017_ ]4, the
holders of the Series E Preferred Units Outstanding as of an applicable Record
Date shall be entitled to receive cumulative distributions (each, a "Series E
Quarterly Distribution"), prior to any other distributions made in respect of
any Junior Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, in the
amount set forth in this _Section 5.16(b)(ii)(A)_ in respect of
each Outstanding Series E Preferred Unit. All such distributions shall be
paid Quarterly within forty-five (45) days after the end of each Quarter (each
such payment date, a "Series E Distribution Payment Date"). For the
Quarter ending [ _December 31, 2017_ ], and for each Quarter thereafter
through and including the Quarter ending immediately prior to the Series E
Coupon Conversion Quarter, the Series E Quarterly Distribution on each
Outstanding Series E Preferred Unit shall be paid in a number of Series E PIK
Preferred Units equal to the Series E PIK Payment Amount; _provided_ that, in
the discretion of the General Partner which determination shall be made prior
to the Record Date for the relevant quarter, the Series E Quarterly
Distribution may be paid as (x) an amount in cash equal to the Series E
Distribution Amount, and (y) a number of Series E PIK Preferred Units equal to
(a) the remainder of the Series E Distribution Amount less the amount of cash
paid pursuant to clause (x), divided by (b) the Series E Adjusted Issue Price
(which, if paid in cash for the Quarter in which the Series E Issuance Date
occurs, the amount payable shall be equal to the product of (I) the amount
payable without regard to this parenthetical times (II) a fraction, of which
the numerator is the number of days from and including the Series E Issuance
Date up to but excluding the date of such Quarters end, and of which the
denominator is 91). With respect to the Series E Coupon Conversion Quarter and
all Quarters thereafter, the Series E Quarterly Distributions shall be paid
entirely in cash at the Series E Distribution Rate per Series E Preferred
Unit. If the Partnership establishes a Record Date for any distribution to be
made by the Partnership on other Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section
6.4_ or _Section 6.5_, then the Record Date established pursuant to this
_Section 5.16(b)(ii)(A)_ for a Series E Quarterly Distribution in respect of
any Quarter shall be the same Record Date established for any distribution to
be made by the Partnership in respect of distributions on other
Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or _Section 6.5_ for such
Quarter. Unless otherwise expressly _provided_ , references in this Agreement
to Series E Preferred Units shall include all Series E PIK Preferred
Units Outstanding as of the date of such determination.

(B) When any Series E PIK Preferred Units are payable to a Record Holder of
Series E Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section 5.16_, the Partnership
shall issue the Series E PIK Preferred Units to such Record Holder no later
than the Series E Distribution Payment Date (the date of issuance of such
Series E PIK Preferred Units, the "Series E PIK Preferred Payment Date"). On



   4  |

Quarter in which the transaction closes. 

---|--- 
 



125  the Series E PIK Preferred Payment Date, the Partnership shall issue to such
Series E Unitholder a Certificate or Certificates for the number of Series E
PIK Preferred Units to which such Series E Unitholder shall be entitled. The
issuance of the Series E PIK Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.16(b)(ii)_ shall be deemed to have been made on the first day of the Quarter
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment of Series E PIK
Preferred Units was due. Prior to the Series E Coupon Conversion Quarter, if,
in violation of this Agreement, the Partnership fails to pay in full or part
any Series E Quarterly Distribution in kind when due, then the
holders entitled to the unpaid Series E PIK Preferred Units shall be entitled
(I) to receive Series E Quarterly Distributions in subsequent Quarters in
respect of such unpaid Series E PIK Preferred Units, (II) to receive the
Series E Liquidation Value in accordance with _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_ in
respect of such unpaid Series E PIK Preferred Units, and (III) to all other
rights under this Agreement as if such unpaid Series E PIK Preferred Units had
in fact been distributed on the date due. Nothing in this _Section
5.16(b)(ii)(B)_ shall alter the obligation of the Partnership to pay any
unpaid Series E PIK Preferred Units or the right of the holders of Series E
Preferred Units to enforce this Agreement to compel the Partnership to
distribute any unpaid Series E PIK Preferred Units. Fractional Series E PIK
Preferred Units shall not be issued to any person (each fractional Series E
PIK Preferred Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Series E PIK
Preferred Unit (and a 0.5 Series E PIK Preferred Unit shall be rounded up to
the next higher Series E PIK Preferred Unit)).

(C) If, in violation of this Agreement, the Partnership fails to pay in full
or part any Series E Quarterly Distribution in cash (or, if prior to the
Series E Coupon Conversion Quarter, Series E PIK Preferred Units, as
applicable) when due, then, without limiting any rights of the holders of the
Series E Preferred Units to compel the Partnership to make such distribution,
from and after the first date of such failure and continuing until such
failure is cured by payment in full in cash (or, if prior to the Series E
Coupon Conversion Quarter, Series E PIK Preferred Units, as applicable) of all
arrearages with respect to any Series E Quarterly Distribution, including
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, (w) the amount of such
unpaid distributions ("Series E Unpaid Distributions") will accrue and
accumulate from and including the first day of the Quarter immediately
following the Quarter in respect of which such payment is due until paid in
full, (x) any Series E Unpaid Distribution shall accrue interest from the
applicable Series E Distribution Payment Date at rate equal to 6% per annum,
and (y) the Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall not, declare or
make (i) any distributions in respect of any Junior Interests and (ii) any
distributions in respect of any Series E Parity Securities.

 

(D) If all or any portion of a Series E Quarterly Distribution is to be paid
in cash, then the aggregate amount of such cash to be so distributed in
respect of the Series E Preferred Units Outstanding as of the Record Date for
such Series E Quarterly Distribution shall be paid out of Available Cash prior
to making any distribution pursuant to _Section 6.4_ or  _Section 6.5_. To
the extent that any portion of a Series E Quarterly Distribution to be paid in
cash with respect to

 



126  any Quarter, together with any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution,
Series C Quarterly Distribution and Series D Quarterly Distribution to be paid
in cash with respect to such Quarter, exceeds the amount of Available Cash
for such Quarter, an amount of cash equal to the Available Cash for such
Quarter will be paid to the Series A Unitholders, the Series C Unitholders,
the Series D Unitholders and Series E Unitholders Pro Rata and the balance of
such Series E Quarterly Distribution (and Series A Quarterly Distribution,
Series C Quarterly Distribution and Series D Quarterly Distribution) shall be
unpaid and shall constitute an arrearage and accrue interest as set forth in 
_Section 5.16(b)(ii)(C)_. The Partnership shall provide written notice to the
Series E Unitholders, not later than the last Business Day of the month
immediately following the end of such Quarter, describing in reasonable detail
the Partnerships calculation of Available Cash for such Quarter and the
portion, if any, of the Series E Quarterly Distribution the Partnership will
be unable to pay on the applicable Series E Distribution Payment Date.

 

(E) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.16(b)(ii)_ to the contrary,
with respect to Series E Preferred Units that are converted into Common
Units, the holder thereof shall not be entitled to a Series E Preferred Unit
distribution and a Common Unit distribution with respect to the same period,
but shall be entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the
class of Units held as of the close of business on the applicable Record Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, if a Series E Conversion Notice Date occurs prior
to the close of business on a Record Date for payment of a distribution on
the Common Units, the applicable holder of Series E Preferred Units shall
receive only the Common Unit distribution with respect to such period.

 

(F) Notwithstanding anything in Article VI to the contrary, neither the
General Partner nor the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights shall be
entitled to receive distributions or allocations of income or gain that
correspond or relate to amounts distributed or allocated to Unitholders in
respect of Series E Preferred Units, regardless of whether the amounts
so distributed or allocated in respect of the Series E Preferred Units were
determined under the definition of "Series E Distribution Rate" or were
otherwise determined on an "as converted" basis.

 

(iii) _Issuance of Series E Preferred Units_. The Series E Preferred Units
shall be issued by the Partnership pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Contribution Agreement.

(iv) _Liquidation Value_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Partnership under _Section 12.4_ or a sale, exchange or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, either voluntary or involuntary, the Record Holders of the Series
E Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the
Partnership available for distribution to the Partners or any assignees, prior
and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the Partnership to the
Record Holders of any other class or series of Partnership Interests (other
than Series A Preferred

 



127  Units, Series C Preferred Units and Series D Preferred Units as to which the
Series E Preferred Units are pari passu), the positive value in each such
holders Capital Account in respect of such Series E Preferred Units. If in
the year of such liquidation and winding up, or sale, exchange or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership, any
such Record Holders Capital Account in respect of such Series E Preferred
Units is less than the aggregate Series E Liquidation Value of such Series E
Preferred Units, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, and prior to any other allocation pursuant to this
Agreement for such year and prior to any distribution pursuant to the
preceding sentence, items of gross income and gain shall be allocated to all
Unitholders then holding Series E Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital
Account in respect of each Outstanding Series E Preferred Unit is equal to
the Series E Liquidation Value (and no other allocation pursuant to this
Agreement shall reverse the effect of such allocation), with such allocation
being made Pro Rata with any allocation made pursuant to the second sentences
of _Section 5.12 (b)(iv)_, _Section 5.14(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.15(b)(iv)_.
If in the year of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up any such Record
Holders Capital Account in respect of such Series E Preferred Units is less
than the aggregate Series E Liquidation Value of such Series E Preferred Units
after the application of the preceding sentence, then to the extent permitted
by applicable law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, items of gross income and gain for any preceding taxable
period(s) with respect to which IRS Form 1065 Schedules K-1 have not been
filed by the Partnership shall be reallocated to all Unitholders then holding
Series E Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect of
each such Outstanding Series E Preferred Unit after making allocations
pursuant to this and the immediately preceding sentence is equal to the Series
E Liquidation Value (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall
reverse the effect of such allocation), with such allocation being made Pro
Rata with any allocation made pursuant to the third sentences of _Section
5.12(b)(iv)_,  _Section 5.14(b)(iv)_ and _Section 5.15(b)(iv)_. At such
time as such allocations have been made to the Outstanding Series E Preferred
Units, any remaining Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss shall be
allocated to the Partners pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_,
as the case may be. At the time of the dissolution of the Partnership, subject
to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act, the Record Holders of the Series E
Preferred Units shall become entitled to receive any distributions in respect
of the Series E Preferred Units that are accrued and unpaid as of the date of
such distribution in priority over any entitlement of any other Partners or
Assignees with respect to any distributions by the Partnership to such other
Partners or Assignees (other than Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred
Units and Series D Preferred Units as to which the Series E Preferred Units
are pari passu); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the General Partner, as such,
will have no liability for any obligations with respect to such distributions
to any Record Holder(s) of Series E Preferred Units.

 

(v) _Voting Rights_.

 

(A) Except as provided in _Section 5.16(b)(v)(B)_ below, the Outstanding
Series E Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the
voting rights of the Common Units and shall vote with the Common Units as a
single class, so that each Outstanding Series E Preferred Unit will be
entitled to

 



128  one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series E Preferred Unit is
then convertible on each matter with respect to which each Common Unit is
entitled to vote. Each reference in this Agreement to a vote of Record
Holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference to the holders of
Common Units, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Units, Series C Preferred
Units, Series D Preferred Units, and Series E Preferred Units on an " _as if_
" converted basis, and the definition of "Unit Majority" shall correspondingly
be construed to mean at least a majority of the Common Units, the Series A
Preferred Units, the Series B Units, the Series C Preferred Units, Series D
Preferred Units, and Series E Preferred Units, on an "as if" converted basis,
voting together as a single class during any period in which any Series E
Preferred Units are Outstanding.

 

(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series E Preferred Units, voting separately as a
class based upon one vote per Series E Preferred Unit, shall be necessary on
any matter (including a merger, consolidation or business combination) that
adversely affects any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series
E Preferred Units or amends or modifies any of the terms of the Series E
Preferred Units; _provided_ that the Partnership shall be able to amend this
_Section 5.16_ without the approval by the Record Holders of Outstanding
Series E Preferred Units so long as the amendment does not adversely affect
the holders of the Series E Preferred Units in any material respect and does
not affect the holders of the Series E Preferred Units disproportionately in
relation to the holders of Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership may, without the consent or approval of the Record Holders of
Outstanding Series E Preferred Units, create (by reclassification or
otherwise) and issue Junior Interests (including by amending the provisions of
any existing class of Partnership Interests to make such class of Partnership
Interests a class of Junior Interests) in an unlimited amount. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any action shall be deemed
to adversely affect the holders of the Series E Preferred Units in a
material respect if such action would:

(1) reduce the Series E Distribution Rate, change the form of payment of
distributions on the Series E Preferred Units, defer the date from which
distributions on the Series E Preferred Units will accrue, cancel accrued and
unpaid distributions on the Series E Preferred Units or any interest accrued
thereon, or change the seniority rights of the Series E Unitholders as to the
payment of distributions in relation to the Unitholders of any other class or
series of Units or, except as determined to be appropriate in connection with
the issuance of Junior Interests, amend this  _Section 5.16_;

 



129 (2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the holders
of the Series E Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets, of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation
preferences of the holders of the Series E Preferred Units in relation to the
rights upon liquidation of the holders of any other class or series of Units;
or

 

(3) result in a Preferred Unit Change of Control.

 

(vi) _No Series E Parity Securities or Series E Senior Securities_. Other than
Series E PIK Preferred Units issued in connection with the Series E Quarterly
Distribution, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series E Preferred Units, issue any
Series E Parity Securities or Series E Senior Securities.

(vii) _Certificates_.

 

(A) The Series E Preferred Units shall be evidenced by Certificates in such
form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of
any applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned
or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign the
responsibility to another Person, the Partnership will act as the registrar
and transfer agent for the Series E Preferred Units. The Certificates
evidencing Series E Preferred Units shall be separately identified and shall
not bear the same CUSIP number as the Certificates evidencing Common Units.

(B) The certificate(s) representing the Series E Preferred Units may be
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:

"NEITHER THE OFFER NOR SALE OF THESE SECURITIES HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED
FOR SALE, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR PURSUANT TO
AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER AND, IN THE CASE OF A TRANSACTION
EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION, UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT OR
THE PARTNERSHIP HAS RECEIVED DOCUMENTATION REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT
SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT. THIS SECURITY
IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE SIXTH AMENDED
AND RESTATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP, DATED AS OF
[], 2017, AS AMENDED, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PARTNERSHIP
AT ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES."

 



130 (viii) _Conversion_.

 

(A) _At the Option of the Series E Unitholder or the Partnership_. At any time
after the second anniversary of the Series E Issuance Date, subject to any
applicable limitations in the New Credit Agreement, the Series E Preferred
Units shall be convertible, in whole or in part, upon the request of the
Series E Unitholder into a number of Common Units determined by multiplying
the number of Series E Preferred Units to be converted by the Series E
Conversion Rate. At any time after the Series E Optional Conversion Start
Date, subject to any applicable limitations in the New Credit Agreement, the
Series E Preferred Units shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at the
election of the Partnership into a number of Common Units determined by
multiplying the number of Series E Preferred Units to be converted by the
Series E Conversion Rate. Immediately upon any conversion of Series E
Preferred Units, all rights of the Series E Converting Unitholder in respect
thereof shall cease, including, without limitation, any accrual of
distributions, and such Series E Converting Unitholder shall be treated for
all purposes as the owner of Common Units. Fractional Common Units shall not
be issued to any person pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(A)_ (each
fractional Common Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Common Unit (and
a 0.5 Common Unit shall be rounded up to the next higher Common Unit)).

(B) _Conversion Notice_. To convert Series E Preferred Units into Common
Units pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(A)_, either the Series E Converting
Unitholder or the Partnership, as applicable, shall give written notice (a
"Series E Conversion Notice") to the Partnership or the Series E Unitholder,
as applicable, in the form of either Exhibit G-1 or Exhibit G-2, as
applicable, attached hereto stating that either the Series E Unitholder or the
Partnership, as applicable, elects to so convert Series E Preferred Units.
With respect to any Series E Conversion Notice delivered by the Series E
Converting Unitholder to the Partnership, such Series E Conversion Notice
shall state that such Series E Unitholder elects to so convert Series E
Preferred Units and shall state therein with respect to Series E Preferred
Units to be converted pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(A)_ the following:
(a) the number of Series E Convertible Preferred Units to be converted, (b)
the Certificate(s) evidencing the Series E Preferred Units to be converted
and duly endorsed, (c) the name or names in which such Series E Unitholder
wishes the Certificate or Certificates for Series E Conversion Units to be
issued, and (d) such Series E Unitholders computation of the number of
Series E Conversion Units to be received by such Series E Unitholder (or
designated recipient(s)) upon the Series E Conversion Date. The date any
Series E Conversion Notice is delivered by the Series E Unitholder or the
Partnership, as applicable, shall be hereinafter be referred to as a "Series E
Conversion Notice Date."

 

(C) _Timing; Certificates_. If a Series E Conversion Notice is delivered in
accordance with  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(B)_, the Partnership shall issue the
Series E Conversion Units no later than seven (7) days after a Series E
Conversion Notice Date (any date of issuance of such Common Units, a "Series E
Conversion Date"). On the Series E Conversion Date, the Partnership shall
issue to such Series E Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) a Certificate
or Certificates for the number of Series E Conversion Units to which such
holder shall be entitled. 

 



131 In lieu of delivering physical Certificates representing the Series E
Conversion Units issuable upon conversion of Series E Preferred Units,
_provided_ the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depositorys Fast
Automated Securities Transfer program, upon request of the Series E
Unitholder, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series E Conversion
Units issuable upon conversion or distribution payment to such Series E
Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the
Series E Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) prime broker with the
Depository through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The parties
agree to coordinate with the Depository to accomplish this objective. Upon
issuance of Series E Conversion Units to the Series E Converting Unitholder,
all rights under the converted Series E Preferred Units shall cease, and such
Series E Converting Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as the Record
Holder of such Series E Conversion Units.

 

(D) _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership_. If the Partnership (i) makes a distribution on its Common Units
in Common Units, (ii) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units into a
greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its Common
Units into a smaller number of Common Units or (iv) issues by
reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any
reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or business
combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person), then the
Series E Conversion Rate in effect at the time of the Record Date for such
distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination, or
reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of
the Series E Preferred Units after such time shall entitle each Series E
Unitholder to receive the aggregate number of Common Units (or any Partnership
Interests into which such Common Units would have been combined, consolidated,
merged or reclassified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) above) that such
Series E Unitholder would have been entitled to receive if the Series E
Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units immediately prior to such
Record Date or effective date, as the case may be, and in the case of a
merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the
surviving Person, the Partnership shall provide effective provisions to ensure
that the provisions in this _Section 5.16_ relating to the Series E
Preferred Units shall not be abridged or amended and that the Series E
Preferred Units shall thereafter retain the same powers, preferences and
relative participating, optional and other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, that the Series E
Preferred Units had immediately prior to such transaction or event. An
adjustment made pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(D)_ shall become
effective immediately after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and
shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a
subdivision, combination, reclassification (including any reclassification in
connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the
Partnership is the surviving Person) or split. Such adjustment shall be made
successively whenever any event described above shall occur.

 



132 If, in the future, the Partnership issues any Convertible Securities, the
General Partner shall, at the direction and at the option of the holders of a
majority of the Outstanding Series E Preferred Units in their sole discretion,
either (i) amend the provisions of this Agreement relating to antidilution
protection to (A) revise any such provision that is less favorable than the
corresponding provision offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities
(or any related purchase agreement) so that such provision is the same as such
provision offered in the terms of such Convertible Securities (or any related
purchase agreement) and (B) incorporate any provision(s) offered in the terms
of such Convertible Securities (or any related purchase agreement) that is not
currently _provided_ for in this Agreement and which would make the
antidilution protection provisions of this Agreement more favorable to the
holders of Series E Preferred Units, which amendment shall be effective
concurrently with the issuance and/or execution of documentation relating
to such Convertible Securities, or (ii) retain the antidilution language
applicable to the Series E Preferred Units at such time. The Partnership
agrees to provide as much prior notice of the proposed issuance of any such
Convertible Securities and/or execution of documentation relating to such
issuance of Convertible Securities as is reasonably practicable (and in any
event, such notice shall be _provided_ at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to such issuance and/or execution). 

(E) _Follow-On Adjustments_. Except in connection with the exercise of a
Warrant, if the Partnership shall issue or sell, or grant any Follow-on Units
at a Follow-on Price that is less than one hundred percent (100%) of the
Series E Adjusted Issue Price, then the Series E Conversion Rate will be reset
so that it will equal the number determined by dividing the Series E Adjusted
Issue Price immediately before the issuance of the Follow-On Units by the
result achieved through application of the following formula:

 

((CP x OB) + (FP x Q)) / OA

 

Where:

CP = the Series E Adjusted Issue Price in effect immediately before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

FP = the Follow-On Price

 

OB = the total number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding before the
issuance of the Follow-On Units

 



133 Q = the total number of fully diluted Follow-On Units issued OA = the total
number of fully diluted Common Units outstanding after giving effect to the
issuance of the Follow-On Units.

For purposes of this  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(E)_, the indicative price per
Common Unit resulting from the issuance of Convertible Securities will be
determined using the principles set forth in _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(H)(3)_.

 

(F) _Other Extraordinary Transactions Affecting the Partnership_.

 

(1) Prior to the consummation of a Partnership Event, the Partnership shall,
as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than twelve (12)
Business Days prior to the consummation of the Partnership Event, make an
irrevocable written offer (a "Series E Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer"), subject to consummation of the Partnership Event, to each holder of
Series E Preferred Units to redeem all (but not less than all) of such
holders Series E Preferred Units for a price per Series E Preferred Unit
payable in cash equal to the greater of (x) the sum of the Series E Issue
Price and the Series E Unpaid Distributions and all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon (determined in accordance with _Section 5.16(b)(ii)(C)_) and
(y) an amount equal to the product of (1) the number of Common Units
into which each Series E Preferred Unit is convertible pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)(viii)_ on the day immediately prior to the date of the Series E
Partnership Event Change of Control Offer and (2) the sum of (A) the
cash consideration per Common Unit to be paid to the holders of Common Units
pursuant to the Partnership Event plus (B) the fair market value per Common
Unit of the securities or other assets to be distributed to the holders of the
Common Units pursuant to the Partnership Event (as applicable, the "Series E
Partnership Event Payment").

(2) Upon receipt by a Series E Unitholder of a Series E Partnership Event
Change of Control Offer, such Series E Unitholder may elect, by written notice
received by the Partnership no later than five (5) Business Days after the
receipt by such holder of a Series E Partnership Event Change of Control
Offer, to receive Series E Survivor Preferred Securities (as defined below)
pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(F)(2)_ in lieu of a Series E
Partnership Event Payment. Upon receipt of such Series E Unitholders
election to receive Series E Survivor Preferred Securities, the Partnership
shall as promptly as practicable, but in any event prior to the consummation
of any Partnership Event, make appropriate provision to ensure that such
electing holders of Series E Preferred Units receive in such Partnership Event
a preferred security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from such
Partnership Event and containing provisions substantially equivalent to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Series E Preferred
Units, including _Section 5.16_ and _Section 7.3_

 



134   __hereof, without material abridgement, including, without limitation, the
same powers, preferences, rights to distributions, rights to accumulation and
compounding upon failure to pay distributions, and relative participating,
optional or other special rights and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereon, that the Series E Preferred Unit had immediately prior
to such Partnership Event (the "Series E Survivor Preferred Security"). The
Series E Conversion Rate in effect at the time of the effective date of such
Partnership Event shall be proportionately adjusted so that the conversion of
a unit of Series E Survivor Preferred Security after such time shall entitle
the holder to the number of securities or amount of cash or other assets
which, if a Series E Preferred Unit had been converted into Common Units
immediately prior to such Partnership Event, such holder would have been
entitled to receive immediately following such Partnership Event. Subsequent
adjustments to the Series E Conversion Rate of the Series E Survivor Preferred
Security shall be made successively thereafter whenever any event described
in  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(D)_, _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(E)_ or this _Section
5.16(b)(viii)(F)_ shall occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership
may consummate a Partnership Event without making appropriate provision to
ensure that the holders of Series E Preferred Units receive a Series E
Partnership Event Payment or Series E Survivor Preferred Security, as
applicable, with respect to such Partnership Event if prior to such
consummation the Partnership has received the prior written approval of the
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series E Preferred Units.

 

(3) A Series E Partnership Event Change of Control Offer shall be mailed to
each Series E Unitholder and shall describe the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Partnership Event and state:

i) that the Series E Partnership Event Change of Control Offer is being made
pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(F)_ and that the Partnership is
making an offer to redeem all Series E Preferred Units of such Unitholder
(subject to the consummation of the Partnership Event); 

ii) the amount of the Series E Partnership Event Payment and the redemption
date, which shall be the date on which the Partnership Event is consummated
or as soon thereafter as practicable (the "Series E Partnership Event Payment
Date"); and

 

iii) the amount per Common Unit that each Common Unitholder is receiving in
connection with the Partnership Event.

 



135 On the Series E Partnership Event Payment Date, the Partnership (or its
successor) shall pay to each Unitholder of Series E Preferred Units that
accepts the Series E Partnership Event Change of Control Offer an amount in
cash equal to such holders applicable Series E Partnership Event Payment, and
all of such holders rights and privileges under the Series E Preferred Units
or as a Series E Unitholder shall be extinguished.

(G) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this _Section
5.16(b)(viii)_, no adjustment shall be made to the Series E Conversion Rate
pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(D)-(F)_ as a result of any of the
following:

 

(1) the grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase
Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise of any such
options, warrants or rights to employees, officers or directors of the General
Partner or the Partnership and its Subsidiaries in respect of services
_provided_ to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its
Subsidiaries, under compensation plans and agreements approved in good faith
by the General Partner (including any Long Term Incentive Plan); _provided_
that, in the case of options, warrants or rights to purchase Common Units, the
exercise price per Common Unit shall not be less than the Closing Price on
the date such option, warrant or other right is issued;

(2) the issuance of any Common Units as all or part of the consideration to
effect (i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets of an
unrelated third party in an arms-length transaction or (ii) the consummation
of a merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Partnership
with or into another entity to the extent such transaction(s) is or are
validly approved by the vote or consent of the General Partner; and

 

(3) the issuance of Partnership Interests for which an adjustment is made
under another provision of this  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)_.

(H) The following rules shall apply for purposes of this  _Section
5.16(b)(viii)_:

(1) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of Common
Units for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash
paid therefor before deducting any reasonable underwriting discounts or
placement agent fees, commissions or the expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
the Partnership for any underwriting or placement agent or otherwise in
connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

(2) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of
Common Units for consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be valued at the Agreed Value thereof;

 



136 (3) In the case of the issuance or sale of Convertible Securities, the
following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this _Section
5.16(b)(viii)(H)_:

i) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon exercise
(assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability, including,
without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) of options or warrants to purchase or
rights to subscribe for Common Units shall be deemed to have been issued at
the time such options, warrants or rights were issued and for consideration
equal to the consideration (determined in the manner _provided_ in this 
_Section 5.16(b)(viii)(H)_), if any, received by the Partnership upon the
issuance of such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price
_provided_ in such options, warrants or rights (without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) for the Common Units covered
thereby.

ii) The aggregate maximum number of Common Units deliverable upon conversion
of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage
of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments)
for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise of
options or warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for such convertible or
exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange thereof shall
be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were issued or such
options, warrants or rights were issued and for a consideration equal to the
consideration, if any, received by the Partnership for any such securities or
options, warrants or rights, plus the minimum additional consideration, if
any, to be received by the Partnership (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such securities
or upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights and subsequent
conversion or exchange of the underlying convertible or exchangeable
securities, as appropriate (the consideration in each case to be determined in
the manner _provided_ in this  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)_).

 



137 iii) In the event of any change in (x) the number of Common Units deliverable
or (y) the consideration payable to the Partnership upon exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to either Common Units or such
convertible or exchangeable securities or upon conversion of or in exchange
for such convertible or exchangeable securities and not otherwise entitled to
any appropriate antidilution adjustment pursuant to this _Section 5.16_,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the Series E Conversion Rate, to the extent in any way
affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities,
shall be recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be
made for the actual issuance of Common Units or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

 

iv) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights with respect
to either Common Units or such convertible or exchangeable securities or the
termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, the Series E Conversion
Rate, to the extent in any way affected by or computed using such options,
warrants, rights or securities shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of
only the number of Common Units actually issued upon the exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to Common Units, upon the conversion
or exchange of such securities, or the number of Common Units issuable
upon conversion or exchange of the convertible or exchangeable securities
that were actually issued upon exercise of options, warrants or rights related
to such securities.

 

v) The number of Common Units deemed issued and the consideration deemed paid
therefor pursuant to  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(H)(3)i)_ and _ii)_ shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(H)(3)iii) or iv)_.

 

(4) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this _Section
5.16(b)(viii)(H)_, no adjustment shall be made to the number of Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Units or the Series E
Conversion Rate as a result of an event for which an adjustment is made under
another provision of this _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(H)_.

 



138 (5) For purposes of this _Section 5.16(b)(viii)_, no adjustment to
the Series E Conversion Rate shall be made in an amount less than 1/100th of
one cent per Unit; _provided_ that any adjustments that are not required to be
made by reason of this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment made.

(I) In the event of any taking by the Partnership of a Record Date of the
holders of any class of Partnership Interests for the purpose of determining
the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any distribution thereon, any
security or right convertible into or entitling the holder thereof to receive
additional Common Units, or any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise
acquire any Partnership Interests or any other securities or property of the
Partnership, or to receive any other right, the Partnership shall notify each
holder of Series E Preferred Units at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Record Date, of which any such Record Date is to be taken for the purpose of
such distribution, security or right and the amount and character of such
distribution, security or right; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing
requirement shall be deemed satisfied with respect to any holder of Series E
Preferred Units if at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Record Date, the
Partnership shall have issued a press release which shall be posted on the
Partnerships website and carried by one or more wire services, containing the
required information.

 

(J) The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise, property or similar taxes, that may
be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of Series E Conversion Units on
conversion of, or payment of distributions on, Series E Preferred Units
pursuant hereto. _However_ , the holder of any Series E Preferred Units shall
pay any tax that is due because the Series E Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion thereof or distribution payment thereon are issued in a name other
than such Series E Unitholders name.

 

(K) The Partnership agrees that it will act in good faith to make any
adjustment(s) required by this  _Section 5.16(b)(viii)_ equitably and in
such a manner as to afford the Series E Unitholders the benefits of the
provisions hereof, and will not take any action that could reasonably be
expected to deprive such Series E Unitholders of the benefit hereof.

(ix) Reserved.

 

(x) _Tax Estimates_. Upon receipt of a written request from any Series E
Unitholder stating the number of Series E Preferred Units owned by such
holder (which requests shall be made no more than two (2) times per calendar
year and the first such request per calendar year shall be at the
Partnerships expense, and the second at the expense of such requesting
holder), the Partnership shall, within ten (10) days, provide such Series E
Unitholder with a good faith estimate (and reasonable supporting calculations)
of whether there is sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to the
Partnership 

 



139  property such that, if such Series E Unitholder converted its Series E
Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)(viii)(A)_ and such Unrealized
Gain was allocated to such holder pursuant to _Section 5.5 (d)(iii)_, such
holders Capital Account in respect of its converted Series E Preferred Units
would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common
Unit (other than a Series E Conversion Unit received in connection with such
conversion of a Series E Preferred Unit).

(xi) _Fully Paid and Nonassessable_. Any Series E Conversion Unit(s)
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ shall be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act), free
and clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than those
arising under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the holders
thereof.

 

(xii) _Listing of Common Units_. The Partnership will procure, at its sole
expense, the listing of the Series E Conversion Units issuable upon
conversion of the Series E Preferred Units, subject to issuance or notice of
issuance on any National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are
listed or admitted to trading.

 

(c) _Call Right on Series E Preferred Units_. At any time after the fourth
anniversary of the Series E Issuance Date, the Partnership may exercise the
right (the "Series E Call Right"), but shall have no obligation, to require
the holder or holders of the Series E Preferred Units (the "Series E Holders")
to sell, assign and transfer all or a portion of the then outstanding Series
E Preferred Units to the Partnership in accordance with this _Section
5.16(c)_. The Partnership may exercise the Series E Call Right with respect to
any Series E Preferred Unit unless: (A) the exercise of the Series E Call
Right would result in a default under any applicable financing agreements, or
other financing obligations of the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, or
would otherwise be prohibited by any securities or other applicable law, or
(B) the Series E Unitholder or the Partnership has delivered, on or prior to
the date of the Series E Call Exercise Notice (as defined below), a Series E
Conversion Notice with respect to such Series E Preferred Unit (and then no
Series E Call Right may be made as to such Series E Preferred Unit). In the
event the Partnership delivers a Series E Call Exercise Notice in accordance
with this _Section 5.16(c)_ and the Series E Unitholder delivers a Series E
Conversion Notice subsequent to such Series E Call Exercise Notice pursuant
to and in accordance with _Section 5.16(b)(viii)_, then _Section
5.16(b)(viii)_ shall take precedence over this _Section 5.16(c)_ with respect
to the number of Series E Preferred Units that are the subject of such Series
E Conversion Notice, provided such Series E Conversion Notice is irrevocable
and delivered to the Partnership prior to the date that is twenty (20) Trading
Days after the date of the applicable Series E Call Exercise Notice.

(i) Reserved.

 

(ii) The purchase price to be paid by the Partnership in connection with the
exercise of the Series E Call Right shall be the Series E Call Value per
Series E Preferred Unit to be acquired pursuant to the Series E Call Right
(subject to appropriate adjustment for any equity distribution, subdivision or
combination of Partnership Interests).

 



140 (iii) If the Partnership elects to exercise the Series E Call Right,
the Partnership shall deliver a written notice (the "Series E Call Exercise
Notice") to the Series E Holders informing the Series E Holders of the
Partnerships intention to exercise its Series E Call Right. The Series E
Call Exercise Notice shall include a certificate in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ , setting forth (A) the number of Series E
Preferred Units held by each Series E Holder, (B) the number of Series E
Preferred Units with respect to which the Series E Call Right is being
exercised, (C) the bank account information for wire transfer of the purchase
price or address for delivery of the purchase price by check, and (D) the
closing date for the purchase (the "Series E Call Closing Date"), which shall
be no earlier than 10 days or later than 30 days after the date of the Series
E Call Exercise Notice. If any Series E Holder does not notify the Partnership
of a change to the bank account information or address for delivery of the
purchase prices set forth in _Exhibit H_ prior to the date that is two days
before the Series E Call Closing Date, the Partnership shall wire or deliver
to each Series E Holder its portion of the purchase price in immediately
available funds to such bank account or address set forth on _Exhibit H_.

 

(iv) The Series E Call Right may be exercised as to any portion of the
outstanding Series E Preferred Units outstanding at the time a Series E Call
Exercise Notice is delivered, but must be exercised pro-rata as to all Series
E Preferred Units subject to the Series E Call Right.

 

(v) At the closing of the Series E Call Right, (A) the Partnership shall
deliver to each Series E Holder subject thereto a certificate executed on
behalf of the Partnership in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ , and (B)
each such Series E Holder shall deliver to the Partnership a certificate
executed by such Series E Holder in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_ ,
the certificates representing the Series E Preferred Units with transfer
powers, executed in blank, or, if uncertificated, transfer powers executed in
blank, and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by the
Partnership.

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS SECTION

 

Section 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_.

 

Except as otherwise required pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(i)_ and _(iv)_ ,
_Section 5.14(b)(i)_ and _(iv)_ ,  _Section 5.14(b)(i)_ and _(iv)_ ,
_Section 5.15(b)(i)_ and _(iv)_ and _Section 5.16(b)(i)_ and _(iv)_ , for
purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the
Partners among themselves, the Partnerships items of income, gain, loss and
deduction (computed in accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_ shall be allocated
among the Partners in each taxable period as provided herein below:

 

(a) _Net Income_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, Net Income for each taxable period and all items of
income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income
for such taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 



141 (i) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net Income
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ and
the Net Termination Gain allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(i)(A)_ for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to
the aggregate of the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to
_Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ for all previous taxable periods and the Net Termination
Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(ii)(D)_
for the current and all previous taxable periods; and

(ii) The balance, if any, (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its
Percentage Interest, and (y) to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, a percentage equal
to 100% less the percentage applicable to subclause (x).

 

(b) _Net Loss_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, Net Loss for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Loss for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 

(i) First, to the General Partner and the Unitholders, Pro Rata; _provided_ ,
that Net Losses shall not be allocated pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_
to the extent that such allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a
deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable
period (or increase any existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital
Account); and

(ii) The balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

 

(c) _Net Termination Gains and Losses_. After giving effect to the special
allocations set forth in _Section 6.1(d)_, Net Termination Gain or Net
Termination Loss (including a pro rata part of each item of income, gain, loss
and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain or Net
Termination Loss) for such taxable period shall be allocated in the manner
set forth in this _Section 6.1(c)_. All allocations under this _Section
6.1(c)_ shall be made after Capital Account balances have been adjusted by all
other allocations provided under this Section 6.1 and after all distributions
of Available Cash provided under _Section 6.4_ and _Section 6.5_ have been
made; _provided_ , _however_ , that solely for purposes of this _Section
6.1(c)_, Capital Accounts shall not be adjusted for distributions made
pursuant to _Section 12.4_.

(i) Net Termination Gain (including a pro rata part of each item of income,
gain, loss, and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination
Gain) shall be allocated:

(A)  _First_ , to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net
Termination Gain allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this _Section
6.1(c)(i)(A)_ and the Net Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant
to  _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ for the current and all previous taxable periods is
equal to the aggregate of the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner
pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ for all previous taxable periods and the
Net Termination Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section
6.1(c)(ii)(D)_ for all previous taxable periods;

 



142 (B) _Second_ , (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (y) to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, a
percentage equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage Interest, until
the Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding is equal
to the sum of (1) its Unrecovered Initial Unit Price, (2) the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution for the Quarter during which the Liquidation Date
occurs, reduced by any distribution pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)(i)_ with
respect to such Common Unit for such Quarter and (3) any then-existing
Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage; and

(C) _Third_ , (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest, (y) 48% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro
Rata, and (z) to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less
the sum of the percentages applicable to subclauses (x) and (y) of this
clause (C).

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions in this  _Section 6.1(c)(i)_, the
General Partner may adjust the amount of any Net Termination Gain arising in
connection with a Revaluation Event that is allocated to the holders of
Incentive Distribution Rights in a manner that will result (1) in the Capital
Account for each Common Unit that is Outstanding prior to such Revaluation
Event being equal to the Event Issue Value and (2) to the greatest extent
possible, the Capital Account with respect to the Incentive Distribution
Rights that are Outstanding prior to such Revaluation Event being equal to the
amount of Net Termination Gain that would be allocated to the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to this _Section 6.1(c)(i)_
if immediately prior to such Revaluation Event, (i) the Capital Accounts with
respect to all Partnership Interests that were Outstanding immediately prior
to such Revaluation Event were equal to zero and (ii) the aggregate Carrying
Value of all Partnership property equaled the aggregate amount of all of the
Partnerships Liabilities.

(ii) Net Termination Loss (including a pro rata part of each item of income,
gain, loss, and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination
Loss) shall be allocated:

 

(A) _First_ , (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (y) to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, a
percentage equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage Interest, until
the Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding has been
reduced to zero;

 

(B) Reserved.

 

(C) _Second_ , to the General Partner and the Unitholders, Pro Rata;
_provided_ that Net Termination Loss shall not be allocated pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(c)(ii)(C)_ to the extent such allocation would cause any
Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account (or
increase any existing deficit in its Adjusted Capital Account); and 

 



143 (D) _Third_ , the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

 

(d) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 6.1_, the following special allocations shall be made for each
taxable period:

(i) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this  _Section 6.1_, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum
Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated
items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary,
subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor
provision. For purposes of this _Section 6.1(d)_, each Partners Adjusted
Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of gross
income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application
of any other allocations pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_ with respect to
such taxable period (other than an allocation pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(vi)_ and _Section 6.1(d)(vii)_). This _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ is intended
to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

(ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_ (other than _Section 6.1(d)(i)_),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a
net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704- 2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For
purposes of this _Section 6.1(d)_, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of gross income or gain
required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other
allocations pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_, other than  _Section 6.1
(d)(i)_ and other than an allocation pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(vi)_ and
_Section 6.1(d)(iv)_, with respect to such taxable period. This _Section
6.1(d)(ii)_ is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of income and
gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

 

(iii) Priority Allocations.

 

(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property distributed
(except cash or property distributed pursuant to Section 12.4) with respect
to a Unit (other than a Series A Preferred Unit, a Series C Preferred Unit, a
Series D Preferred Unit or a Series E Preferred Unit) exceeds the amount of
cash or the Net Agreed Value of property distributed with respect to another
Unit (other than a Series A Preferred Unit, a Series C Preferred Unit, a
Series D Preferred Unit or a Series E Preferred Unit) (the amount of the
excess, an "Excess Distribution" and the Unit with respect to which the
greater distribution is paid, an "Excess Distribution Unit"), then (1) there
shall be allocated gross income

 



144  and gain to each Unitholder receiving an Excess Distribution with respect to
the Excess Distribution Unit until the aggregate amount of such items
allocated with respect to such Excess Distribution Unit pursuant to this
Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A) for the current taxable period and all previous taxable
periods is equal to the amount of the Excess Distribution; and (2) the General
Partner shall be allocated gross income and gain with respect to each such
Excess Distribution in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(aa) the quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partners Percentage
Interest at the time when the Excess Distribution occurs by (y) a percentage
equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage Interest at the time when
the Excess Distribution occurs, times (bb) the total amount allocated in
clause (1) above with respect to such Excess Distribution.

(B) After the application of _Section 6.1(d)(iii)(A)_, the remaining items of
Partnership income or gain for the taxable period, if any, shall be allocated
(1) to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, Pro Rata, until the
aggregate amount of such items allocated to the holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights pursuant to this  _Section 6.1(d)(iii)(B)_ for the
current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
cumulative amount of all Incentive Distributions made to the holders of
Incentive Distribution Rights from the IPO Closing Date to a date 45 days
after the end of the current taxable period; and (2) to the General Partner an
amount equal to the product of (aa) an amount equal to the quotient determined
by dividing (x) the General Partners Percentage Interest by (y) the sum of
100 less the General Partners Percentage Interest times (bb) the sum of the
amounts allocated in clause (1) above.

 

(iv) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-1 (b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions
as quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such
Partner would have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account as
adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this _Section 6.1_ have
been tentatively made as if this _Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ were not in this
Agreement.

 

(v) _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance
in its Capital Account at the end of any taxable period in excess of the sum
of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed
obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership
gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible;
_provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this  _Section 6.1(d)(v)_ shall
be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit
balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations
provided for in this _Section 6.1_ have been tentatively made as if _Section
6.1(d)(iv)_ and this _Section 6.1(d)(v)_ were not in this Agreement.

 



145 (vi) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable
period shall be allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner
determines that the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated
in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

 

(vii) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(viii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among
the Partners Pro Rata.

 

(ix) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 

(x) _Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law_.

 

(A) Reserved.

 

(B) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of
Partnership property pursuant to  _Section 5.5(d)_ during any taxable period
of the Partnership ending upon, or after, the issuance of IDR Reset Common
Units pursuant to _Section 5.11_ or of Post-Initial Issuance Series B Units,
any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among the
Partners in a manner that to the nearest extent possible results in the
Capital Accounts maintained with respect to all IDR Reset Common Units and
Post-

  



146  Initial Issuance Series B Units equaling the product of (i) the Aggregate
Quantity of IDR Reset Common Units and the total Post-Initial Issuance Series
B Units Outstanding and (ii) the Per Unit Capital Amount for an IPO Common
Unit that is Outstanding.

(C) With respect to any taxable period during which an IDR Reset Common Unit
is transferred to any Person who is not an Affiliate of the transferor, all or
a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the transferor Partner of such
transferred IDR Reset Common Unit until such transferor Partner has been
allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account
maintained with respect to such transferred IDR Reset Common Unit to an amount
equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for an IPO Common Unit.

(D) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems
appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and
cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations of income, gain,
loss, deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (iii) amend the
provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or
promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c)
of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited
Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may
adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to
this Agreement as provided in this _Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)_ only if such
conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse
effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited
Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such
allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

 

(E) At the election of the General Partner, after application of _Section
5.5(d)(iii)_, with respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the
conversion of the Series B Units into Common Units, all or a portion of the
remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period
shall be allocated to each Partner holding Series B Conversion Units in the
proportion of the number of Series B Conversion Units held by such Partner to
the total number of Series B Conversion Units then outstanding, until each
such Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that
increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Series B
Conversion Units to an amount that, after taking into account the other
allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction to be made with respect to
such taxable period, will equal to the product of (i) the number of Series B
Conversion Units held by such Partner and (ii) the Per Unit Capital Amount for
a Common Unit that is not a Post-Initial Issuance Series B Unit. The purpose
of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts
underlying Series B Conversion Units and the Capital Accounts underlying
Common Units that are not Series B Conversion Units.

 



147 (xi) _Curative Allocation_.

 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.1_, other than the
Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in
making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount
of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner
pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated
to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations
and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this
_Section 6.1_. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations
relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except
to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and
(2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to
the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain. In exercising its discretion under this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_,
the General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that,
although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations
previously made. Allocations pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ shall
only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General
Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with
the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, allocations pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ shall be deferred with respect to allocations
pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the extent the General Partner
determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent
Required Allocations.

 

(B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of  _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ in whatever order is most likely
to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such
economic distortions.

(xii) _Corrective and other Allocations_. In the event of any allocation of
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items or any Book-Down Event or any
recognition of a Net Termination Loss, the following rules shall apply:

 

(A) Except as provided in _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(B)_, in the case of any
allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (other than an
allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under _Section 5.5(d)_), the
General Partner shall allocate such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items (1)
to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and the General Partner to
the same extent that the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to
such Additional Book Basis Derivative Items was allocated to them pursuant to
_Section 5.5(d)_ and (2) to all Unitholders, Pro Rata, to the extent that
the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss giving rise to such Additional Book
Basis Derivative Items was allocated to any Unitholders pursuant to _Section
5.5(d)_.

 



148 (B) In the case of any allocation of Additional Book Basis Derivative
Items (other than an allocation of Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss under
_Section 5.5(d)_ or an allocation of Net Termination Gain or Net Termination
Loss pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)_) as a result of a sale or other
taxable disposition of any Partnership asset that is an Adjusted Property
including, for this purpose, inventory ("Disposed of Adjusted Property"), the
General Partner shall allocate (1) additional items of gross income and gain
(aa) away from the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights and (bb) to the
Unitholders, or (2) additional items of deduction and loss (aa) away from the
Unitholders and (bb) to the holders of Incentive Distribution Rights, to the
extent that the Additional Book Basis Derivative Items with respect to the
Disposed of Adjusted Property (determined in accordance with the last sentence
of the definition of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items) treated as having
been allocated to the Unitholders pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(B)_
exceed their Share of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items with respect to
such Disposed of Adjusted Property. For purposes of this _Section
6.1(d)(xii)(B)_ the Unitholders shall be treated as having been allocated
Additional Book Basis Derivative Items to the extent that such Additional Book
Basis Derivative Items have reduced the amount of income that would otherwise
have been allocated to the Unitholders under the Partnership Agreement (
_e.g._ , Additional Book Basis Derivative Items taken into account in
computing cost of goods sold would reduce the amount of book income otherwise
available for allocation among the Partners). Any allocation made pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(B)_ shall be made after all of the other Agreed
Allocations have been made as if this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)_ were not in this
Agreement and, to the extent necessary, shall require the reallocation
of items that have been allocated pursuant to such other Agreed Allocations.

(C) In the case of any negative adjustments to the Capital Accounts of the
Partners resulting from a Book-Down Event or from the recognition of a Net
Termination Loss, such negative adjustment (1) shall first be allocated, to
the extent of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments, in such a
manner, as determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible the
aggregate Capital Accounts of the Partners will equal the amount that would
have been the Capital Account balances of the Partners if no prior Book-Up
Events had occurred, and (2) any negative adjustment in excess of the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments shall be allocated pursuant to
_Section 6.1(c)_ hereof. In allocating Net Termination Loss pursuant to
this  _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(C)_, the General Partner shall attempt, to the
extent possible, to cause the Capital Accounts of the Unitholders, on the one
hand, and holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights, on the other hand, to
equal the amount they would equal if (i) the Carrying Values of the
Partnerships property had not been previously adjusted in connection with any
prior Book-Up Events, (ii) Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss (or, in the
case of a liquidation, Liquidation Gain or Liquidation

 



149  Loss) with respect to such Partnership Property were determined with respect
to such unadjusted Carrying Values, and (iii) any resulting Net Termination
Gain had been allocated pursuant to  _Section 6.1(c)(i)_ (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, taking into account the provisions set forth in the last
sentence of _Section 6.1(c)(i)_).

 

(D) In making the allocations required under this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)_, the
General Partner may apply whatever conventions or other methodology it
determines will satisfy the purpose of this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)_. Without
limiting the foregoing, if an Adjusted Property is contributed by the
Partnership to another entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (the "lower tier partnership"), the General Partner may
make allocations similar to those described in _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)_,
_(B)_ , and _(C)_ to the extent the General Partner determines such
allocations are necessary to account for the Partnerships allocable share of
income, gain, loss and deduction of the lower tier partnership that relate to
the contributed Adjusted Property in a manner that is consistent with the
purpose of this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)_.

(xiii) _Special Cost Recovery Deductions_. For any taxable period ending
after the effective time of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement, any and all cost recovery deductions available to the Partnership
with respect to the underlying Partnership assets attributable to the
increase in the Capital Account of the General Partner pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement (the "GP Assets") may, at the General Partners
discretion, in whole or in part, be allocated to the General Partner until
the portion of the Capital Account attributable to the GP Assets is reduced
to zero.

(xiv) _Redemption or Call of Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred
Units or Series E Preferred Units_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this _Section 6.1_ (other than the Regulatory Allocations), with respect to
any taxable period during which Series A Preferred Units are redeemed or
called pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(F)_ or _Section
5.12(c)_, Series C Preferred Units are redeemed or called pursuant to the
terms of _Section 5.14(b)(viii)(G)_ or  _Section 5.14(c)_, Series D
Preferred Units are called pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.15(c)_ or
Series E Preferred Units are redeemed or called pursuant to the terms of
_Section 5.16(b)(viii)(F)_ or  _Section 5.16(c)_, each Partner holding
redeemed or called Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred Units or
Series E Preferred Units shall, to the extent necessary after the allocation
of Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)(ii)_, be
allocated items of income, gain, loss and deduction in a manner that results
in the Capital Account balance of each such Partner attributable to its
redeemed or called Series A Preferred Units, Series C Preferred Units or
Series E Preferred Units, as appropriate, immediately prior to such redemption
(and after taking into account any applicable Regulatory Allocations) to equal
(i) the amount of cash paid to such Partner in redemption of such Series A
Preferred Units, Series C Preferred Units or Series E Preferred Units, as
appropriate, and (ii) the product of the number of Common Units received in
the redemption and the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common
Unit. 

 



150 Section 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the
Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain,
loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain,
loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be
allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner
provided under Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 704 (b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined
appropriate by the General Partner (taking into account the General Partners
discretion under _Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)_); _provided_ , that the General
Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)
in all events.

(c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion
of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized
appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-
Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the Unamortized Book-Tax
Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor
regulations thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting
position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt
depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring
Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and
amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had
purchased a direct interest in the Partnerships property. If the General
Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may
use any other depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the
uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner
Interests, so long as such conventions would not have a material adverse
effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes
of Limited Partner Interests.

(d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this 
_Section 6.2_, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions
and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest)
have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

(e) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s) and
1.704-1(b)(4)(x), if Capital Account balances are reallocated among Partners
in accordance with _Section 5.5 (d)(iii)_, beginning with the year of
reallocation and continuing until the allocations required are fully taken
into account, the Partnership will make corrective allocations to take into
account the Capital Account reallocation.

 



151 (f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the
Partnership; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such allocations, once made,
shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take
into account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743
of the Code.

 

(g) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, for federal
income tax purposes, shall be determined for each taxable period and prorated
on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of
the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed
or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of
any assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income
or loss realized and recognized other than in the ordinary course of
business, as determined by the General Partner, shall be allocated to the
Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the
Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business
Day of the month in which such gain or loss is recognized for federal income
tax purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such
methods of allocation to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of
the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

(h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this _Article VI_ shall instead be made to the beneficial owner
of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by
the General Partner.

(i) If, as a result of an exercise of a Noncompensatory Option, a Capital
Account reallocation is required under Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner shall make corrective allocations
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

Section 6.3 _Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions
to Record Holders_.

(a) Except as described in _Section 6.3(b)_ or _Section 6.3(c)_, within 45
days following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to 100% of Available
Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be distributed in accordance with this
_Article VI_ by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected
by the General Partner. All amounts of Available Cash distributed by the
Partnership on any date following the IPO Closing Date from any source shall
be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of Available
Cash distributed by the Partnership to the Partners following the IPO Closing
Date pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ equals the Operating Surplus from the IPO
Closing Date through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter. Any
remaining amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on
such date shall, except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.5_, be deemed to
be "Capital Surplus." Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
all distributions required to be made 

 



152  under this Agreement or otherwise made by the Partnership shall be made
subject to Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Partnership shall
not be required to make a distribution to any Partner on account of its
interest in the Partnership if such distribution would violate the Delaware
Act or any other applicable law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(a)_, in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all cash received during or after the Quarter
in which the Liquidation Date occurs, other than from Working Capital
Borrowings, shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section 12.4_.

 

(c) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of,
or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners, as
a distribution of Available Cash to such Partners.

(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

 

Section 6.4 _Distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus_.

 

(a) Reserved.

(b) Available Cash with respect to any Quarter that is deemed to be Operating
Surplus pursuant to the provisions of _Section 6.3_ or _Section 6.5_ shall,
subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed as follows,
except as otherwise contemplated by _Section 5.6_ in respect of other
Partnership Interests or other securities issued pursuant thereto:

 

(i) _First_ , (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (y) to the Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, a
percentage equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage Interest until
there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for such Quarter;

(ii) _Second_ , (x) to the General Partner in accordance with its Percentage
Interest and (y) to the Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, a
percentage equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage Interest until
there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage existing with respect to
such Common Unit; and

(iii) Thereafter, (A) to the General Partner in accordance with its
Percentage Interest; (B) 48% to the holders of the Incentive Distribution
Rights, Pro Rata; and (C) to all Unitholders holding Common Units, Pro Rata, a
percentage equal to 100% less the sum of the percentages applicable to
subclauses (A) and (B) of this clause (iii);

 



153   _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution has
been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of _Section 6.6(a)_, the
distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be Operating Surplus with
respect to any Quarter will be made solely in accordance with _Section
6.4(b)_(iii).

 

Section 6.5 _Distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus_.

 

Available Cash with respect to any Quarter ending on or after the IPO Closing
Date that is deemed to be Capital Surplus pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 6.3(a)_ shall, subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, be
distributed, unless the provisions of _Section 6.3_ require otherwise, 100%
to the General Partner and the Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the Minimum
Quarterly Distribution has been reduced to zero pursuant to the second
sentence of _Section 6.6(a)_. Available Cash that is deemed to be Capital
Surplus shall then be distributed (a) to the General Partner in
accordance with its Percentage Interest and (b) to all Unitholders holding
Common Units, Pro Rata, a percentage equal to 100% less the General Partners
Percentage Interest, until there has been distributed in respect of each
Common Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the Cumulative Common Unit
Arrearage. Thereafter, all Available Cash shall be distributed as if it were
Operating Surplus and shall be distributed in accordance with _Section 6.4_.

 

Section 6.6 _Adjustment of Minimum Quarterly Distribution_.

 

(a) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, Common Unit Arrearages and Cumulative
Common Unit Arrearages shall be proportionately adjusted in the event of any
distribution, combination or subdivision (whether effected by a distribution
payable in Units or otherwise) of Units or other Partnership Interests. In the
event of a distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be from
Capital Surplus, the then applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall be
reduced in the same proportion that the distribution had to the fair market
value of the Common Units immediately prior to the announcement of the
distribution. If the Common Units are publicly traded on a National
Securities Exchange, the fair market value will be the Current Market Price
before the ex-dividend date. If the Common Units are not publicly traded, the
fair market value will be determined by the Board of Directors.

(b) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution shall also be subject to adjustment
pursuant to _Section 5.11_ and  _Section 6.9_.

Section 6.7 _Reserved_.

 

Section 6.8 _Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Incentive
Distribution Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Incentive Distribution Rights (i) shall (A) possess the rights
and obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner
pursuant to Article III and Article VII and (B) have a Capital Account as a
Partner pursuant to _Section 5.5_ and all other provisions related thereto
and (ii) shall not (A) be entitled to vote on any matters requiring the
approval or vote of the holders of Outstanding Units, except as provided by
law or contemplated by _Section 11.2_, (B) be entitled to any distributions
other than as provided in _Section 6.4(b)(ii)_ and _Section 12.4_ or (C) be
allocated items of income, gain, loss or deduction other than as specified in
this Article VI.

 



154 (b) The Unitholder holding Common Units that have resulted from the conversion
of Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to _Section 5.11_ shall not be
issued a Common Unit Certificate pursuant to _Section 4.1_ if the Common
Units are evidenced by Certificates, and shall not be permitted to transfer
such Common Unit to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder until
such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that
each such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic
economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics, in all material
respects, to the intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax
characteristics of an IPO Common Unit. In connection with the condition
imposed by this _Section 6.8(b)_, the General Partner may take whatever
steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such Common Units in
preparation for a transfer of such Common Units, including the application of
_Section 5.5(c)(ii)_, _Section 6.1(d)(x)(B)_, or  _Section 6.1(d)(x)(C)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such steps may be taken that would have a
material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units.

 

Section 6.9 _Entity-Level Taxation_.

 

If legislation is enacted or the official interpretation of existing
legislation is modified by a governmental authority, which after
giving effect to such enactment or modification, results in a Group Member
becoming subject to federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or withholding
taxes in excess of the amount of such taxes due from the Group Member prior to
such enactment or modification (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
increase in the rate of such taxation applicable to the Group Member), then
the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, reduce the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution by the amount of income or withholding taxes that are payable by
reason of any such new legislation or interpretation (the "Incremental Income
Taxes"), or any portion thereof selected by the General Partner, in the manner
provided in this  _Section 6.9_. If the General Partner elects to reduce the
Minimum Quality Distribution for any Quarter with respect to all or a portion
of any Incremental Income Taxes, the General Partner shall estimate for such
Quarter the Partnership Groups aggregate liability (the "Estimated
Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount") for all (or the relevant portion of) such
Incremental Income Taxes; provided that any difference between such estimate
and the actual liability for Incremental Income Taxes (or the relevant
portion thereof) for such Quarter may, to the extent determined by the General
Partner, be taken into account in determining the Estimated Incremental
Quarterly Tax Amount with respect to each Quarter in which any such
difference can be determined. For each such Quarter, the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution shall be the product obtained by multiplying (a) the then
applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution times (b) the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) Available Cash with respect to such Quarter by (ii) the sum
of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter and the Estimated Incremental
Quarterly Tax Amount for such Quarter, as determined by the General Partner.
For purposes of the foregoing, Available Cash with respect to a Quarter will
be deemed reduced by the Estimated Incremental Quarterly Tax Amount for that
Quarter.

 

Section 6.10 _Special Provisions Relating to Series A Unitholders, Series B
Unitholders, Series C Unitholders, Series D Unitholders and Series E
Unitholders_.

 



155 (a) Subject to transfer restrictions in _Section 4.8_ of this Agreement, a
Unitholder holding a Series A Conversion Unit, a Series C Conversion Unit, a

duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

in a manner consistent with then-applicable accounting and allocation
methodologies generally permitted by FERC for rate-making purposes (or in the
absence of then-applicable methodologies permitted by FERC, consistent with
the most-recently applicable methodologies) and past business practices shall

(c) The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who
shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership benefit plans, programs and practices (including the
Long Term Incentive Plan and other plans, programs and practices involving the

or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership Group. The Partnership
agrees to issue and sell to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates any
Partnership Interests or other securities that the General Partner or such
Affiliates are obligated to provide to any employees, officers and directors
pursuant to any such benefit plans, programs or practices. Expenses incurred
by the General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs and
practices (including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates
of Partnership Interests or other securities purchased by the General Partner
or such Affiliates, from the Partnership or otherwise, to fulfill options or
awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in
accordance with _Section 7.4(b)_. Any

 



162 and all obligations of the General Partner under any benefit plans, programs

of the General Partners General Partner Interest pursuant to _Section 4.6_.

management fee or fees exceeds the amount of such fee or fees.

 

Section 7.5 _Outside Activities_.

 

(a) The General Partner, for so long as it is the General Partner of the
Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general
partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any
other partnership or limited liability company of which the Partnership is,
directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake activities that
are ancillary or related thereto (including being a Limited Partner in the
Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business or activity or incur
any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its
performance as general partner or managing member, if any, of one or more
Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statement, (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt securities or equity
interests in any Group Member or (C) the guarantee of, and mortgage, pledge,
or encumbrance of any or all of its assets in connection with, any
indebtedness of any Affiliate of the General Partner.

 

(b) Each Unrestricted Person (other than the General Partner) shall have the
right to engage in businesses of every type and description and other
activities for profit and to engage in and possess an interest in other
business ventures of any and every type or description, whether in businesses
engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in by any Group Member, independently
or with others, including business interests and activities in direct
competition with the business and activities of any Group Member, and none of
the same shall constitute a breach of this Agreement or any duty otherwise
existing at law, in equity or otherwise, to any Group Member or any Partner.
None of any Group Member, any Limited Partner or any other Person shall have
any rights by virtue of this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the
partnership relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any
Unrestricted Person.

(c) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(a)_ and _Section 7.5(b)_, but
otherwise notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
engaging in competitive activities by any Unrestricted Person (other than the
General Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.5_ is
hereby approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed
not to be a breach of any fiduciary duty or any other obligation of any type
whatsoever of the General Partner or any other Unrestricted Person for the
Unrestricted Persons (other than the General Partner) to engage in such
business interests and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the
Partnership and (iii) the Unrestricted Persons shall have no obligation
hereunder or as a result of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise,

 



163 to present business opportunities to the Partnership. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or
any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Unrestricted Person (including
the General Partner). No Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner)
who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or
other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership, shall have any
duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Partnership, and such
Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) shall not be liable to
the Partnership, to any Limited Partner or any other Person bound by this
Agreement for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that
such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) pursues or acquires
for itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not
communicate such opportunity or information to the Partnership; _provided_
such Unrestricted Person does not engage in such business or activity as a
result of or using confidential or proprietary information provided by or on
behalf of the Partnership to such Unrestricted Person.

(d) The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Units or other
Partnership Interests in addition to those acquired on the IPO Closing Date
and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to
exercise, at their option, all rights relating to all Units or other
Partnership Interests acquired by them. The term "Affiliates" when used in
this _Section 7.5(d)_ with respect to the General Partner shall not include
any Group Member.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that any provision of this Agreement purports or is interpreted to have the
effect of restricting or eliminating the fiduciary duties that might
otherwise, as a result of Delaware or other applicable law, be owed by the
General Partner to the Partnership and its Limited Partners, or to constitute
a waiver or consent by the Limited Partners to any such restriction or
elimination, such provisions shall be deemed to have been approved by the
Partners.

 

Section 7.6 _Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership or Group Members_.

 

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may, but shall be under no
obligation to, lend to any Group Member, and any Group Member may, but shall
be under no obligation to, borrow from the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods of
time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, in any such case the lending party may not charge the
borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged
the borrowing party, or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party
than would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party, by unrelated lenders
on comparable loans made on an arms-length basis (without reference to the
lending partys financial abilities or guarantees), all as determined by the
General Partner. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for
any costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending
party in connection with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this
_Section 7.6(a)_ and  _Section 7.6(b)_, the term "Group Member" shall
include any Affiliate of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group
Member.

 



164 (b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
determined by the General Partner. No Group Member may lend funds to the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than another Group Member).

 

(c) No borrowing by any Group Member or the approval thereof by the General
Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty hereunder or
otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, of the General Partner or
its Affiliates to the Partnership or the Limited Partners existing hereunder,
or existing at law, in equity or otherwise by reason of the fact that the
purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to enable
distributions to the General Partner or its Affiliates (including in their
capacities as Limited Partners) to exceed the General Partners Percentage
Interest of the total amount distributed to all Partners.

Section 7.7 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other
amounts arising from any and all threatened pending or completed claims,
demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and including
appeals, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee
and acting (or refraining to act) in such capacity; _provided_ , that the
Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to this
Agreement if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for
which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or,
in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitees
conduct was unlawful. Any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_
shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that
the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification
and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to
the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to _Section
7.7(a)_ in appearing at, participating in or defending any claim, demand,
action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the
Partnership prior to a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which
the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_, the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership
of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if
it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized by this  _Section 7.7_.

(c) The indemnification provided by this _Section 7.7_ shall be in addition
to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any
agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in
the Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other
capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns
and administrators of the Indemnitee.

 



165 (d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the
General Partner, its Affiliates, the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the
General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted
against, or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with
the Partnerships activities or such Persons activities on behalf of the
Partnership, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this
Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this _Section 7.7_, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit
plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also
imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or
participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law
shall constitute "fines" within the meaning of _Section 7.7(a)_; and action
taken or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the
performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the
best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be
deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this  _Section 7.7_ because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors
and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the
benefit of any other Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.7_ or any
provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of
any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership,
nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under
and in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.

Section 7.8  _Liability of Indemnitees_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Partners or any other Persons who have acquired interests in the Partnership
Interests, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act
or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final and

 



166 non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted
in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a
criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitees conduct was
criminal.

 

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted
to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner
shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any
such agent appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the Partnerships business or affairs shall not be
liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on
the provisions of this Agreement.

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this  _Section 7.8_ or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this _Section 7.8_ as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

 

Section 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and
Modification of Duties_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member
Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between
the General Partner (in its individual capacity or its capacity as general
partner, limited partner or holder of Incentive Distribution Rights) or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member or
any Partner, on the other, any resolution or course of action by the General
Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such conflict of interest shall be
permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member Agreement, of any agreement
contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty hereunder stated or implied by
law or equity or otherwise, if the resolution or course of action in respect
of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii)
approved by the vote of a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding
Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates), (iii) on terms
no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to
or available from unrelated third parties or (iv) fair and reasonable to the
Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the
parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly
favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner shall be
authorized but not required in connection with its resolution of such conflict
of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval of
such resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or
course of action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder
approval. If Special Approval is sought, then it shall be presumed that, in
making its decision, the Conflicts Committee acted in good faith, and if
neither

 



167 Special Approval nor Unitholder approval is sought and the Board of Directors
determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a
conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses
(iii) or (iv) above, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision,
the Board of Directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by
any Limited Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited Partner or any other
Limited Partner or the Partnership challenging such approval, the Person
bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of overcoming
such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of the
conflicts of interest described in the Registration Statement and any actions
of the General Partner taken in connection therewith are hereby approved by
all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or of any
duty hereunder or existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

 

(b) Whenever the General Partner, the Board of Directors or any committee of
thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes
or declines to take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes the
General Partner to do so, in the General Partners capacity as the general
partner of the Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether
under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby or otherwise, then, unless another express standard is
provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, the Board of Directors,
such committee or such Affiliates causing the General Partner to do so, shall
make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in good
faith and shall not be subject to any other or different standards (including
fiduciary standards) imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement,
any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other
law, rule or regulation or at equity. In order for a determination or other
action to be in "good faith" for purposes of this Agreement, the Person or
Persons making such determination or taking or declining to take such other
action must subjectively believe that the determination or other action is in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership.

 

(c) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to
take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its
individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of
the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General
Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to
take such other action free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or
obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or any other
Person bound by this Agreement, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates
causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at
equity. By way of illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrases,
"at the option of the General Partner," "in its sole discretion" or some
variation of those phrases, are used in this Agreement, it indicates that the
General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of
doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership
Interests, or refrains from voting or transferring its Partnership Interests,
or otherwise acts in its capacity as a limited partner or holder of
Partnership Interests other than the General Partner Interest, it shall be
acting in its individual capacity.

 



168 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General
Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or
implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership
Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group
Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its
Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to
time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be in its
sole discretion.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the General
Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities,
including fiduciary duties, to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and the
provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict, eliminate or
otherwise modify the duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of
the General Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in
equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and
liabilities of the General Partner or such other Indemnitee.

 

(f) The Limited Partners hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of
the Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve of
actions by the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar
to those actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this
_Section 7.9_.

 

Section 7.10 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_.

 

(a) The General Partner may rely upon, and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon, any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 

(b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such
Persons as to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be
within such Persons professional or expert competence shall be conclusively
presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with
such advice or opinion.

 

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers,
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers
of the Partnership or any Group Member.

 

Section 7.11 _Purchase or Sale of Partnership Interests_.

 

Subject to _Section 5.12(b)(v)_, _Section 5.14(b)(v)_, _Section 5.15(b)(v)_
and _Section 5.16(b)(v)_, the General Partner may cause the Partnership to
purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership Interests; _provided_ that, except
as permitted pursuant to _Section 4.10_ or with approval of the Conflicts
Committee, the General Partner may not cause any Group Member to purchase
Incentive Distribution Rights. As long as Partnership Interests are held by
any Group

 



169 Member, such Partnership Interests shall not be considered Outstanding for any
purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or any
Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and
sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Interests for its own account,
subject to the provisions of Article IV and Article X. 

Section 7.12 _Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates
and Holdings_.

 

(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
(including for purposes of this _Section 7.12_, any Person that is an
Affiliate of the General Partner at the date hereof notwithstanding that it
may later cease to be an Affiliate of the General Partner, but excluding any
individual who is an Affiliate of the General Partner based on
such individuals status as an officer, director or employee of the General
Partner or an Affiliate of the General Partner) or Holdings or any Affiliate
of Holdings holds Partnership Interests that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule
144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144)
or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such holder
of Partnership Interests (the "Holder") to dispose of the number of
Partnership Interests it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so
without registration under the Securities Act, then at the option and upon the
request of the Holder, the Partnership shall file with the Commission as
promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain
effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective
date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all Partnership
Interests covered by such registration statement have been sold, a
registration statement under the Securities Act registering the offering and
sale of the number of Partnership Interests specified by the Holder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall not be required to effect
more than six registrations pursuant to this _Section 7.12(a)_ with respect
to requests by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates and not more than
two registrations pursuant to this  _Section 7.12(a)_ with respect to
requests by Holdings and its Affiliates; and _provided further_ , _however_ ,
that if the General Partner determines that a postponement of the requested
registration would be in the best interests of the Partnership and its
Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation or other event, the
filing of such registration statement or the effectiveness thereof may be
deferred for up to six months, but not thereafter. In connection with
any registration pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Partnership shall (i) promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be
necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to such registration
under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such qualification shall be required
in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become
subject to general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do
business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such
jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration, and (B) such documents
as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the Partnership Interests
subject to such registration on such National Securities Exchange as the
Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii) do any and all other acts and things
that may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a
public sale of such Partnership Interests in such states. Except as set forth
in _Section 7.12(c)_, all costs and expenses of any such registration and
offering at the request of the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be
paid by the Partnership, without

 



170 reimbursement by the Holder. Except as set forth in _Section 7.12(c)_, all
costs and expenses of one such registration and offering at the request of
Holdings or its Affiliates (other than the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder, but only to the extent Holdings or its Affiliates makes such request
within twenty (20) days after a Series E Conversion Date resulting from a
Series E Conversion Notice delivered by the Partnership in accordance with
_Section 5.16(b)(viii)_, and all costs and expenses of any other such
registration and offering at the request of Holdings or its Affiliates
(including the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by
Holdings or its Affiliates.

 

(b) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of Partnership Interests
for cash (other than an offering relating solely to a benefit plan), the
Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to include such
number or amount of Partnership Interests held by any Holder in such
registration statement as the Holder shall request; _provided_ , that the
Partnership is not required to make any effort or take any action to so
include the Partnership Interests of the Holder once the registration
statement becomes or is declared effective by the Commission, including any
registration statement providing for the offering from time to time of
Partnership Interests pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act. If the
proposed offering pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_ shall be
an underwritten offering, then, in the event that the managing underwriter or
managing underwriters of such offering advise the Partnership and the Holders
that in their opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holders Partnership
Interests would adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the
offering, the Partnership shall include in such offering only that number or
amount, if any, of Partnership Interests held by the Holder or Holders that,
in the opinion of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, will not
so adversely and materially affect the offering. Except as set forth in
_Section 7.12(c)_, all costs and expenses of any such registration and
offering at the request of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates
(other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the
Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder. Except as set forth in
_Section 7.12(c)_, all costs and expenses of one such registration and
offering at the request of Holdings or its Affiliates (other than the
underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership,
without reimbursement by the Holder, but only to the extent Holdings or its
Affiliates makes such request within twenty (20) days after a Series E
Conversion Date resulting from a Series E Conversion Notice delivered by the
Partnership in accordance with _Section 5.16(b)(viii)_, and all costs and
expenses of any other such registration and offering at the request of
Holdings or its Affiliates (including the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by Holdings or its Affiliates.

 

(c) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this _Section 7.12_, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
in addition to and not in limitation of the Partnerships obligation under
_Section 7.7_, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each
Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and
any agent thereof (collectively, "Indemnified Persons") from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties,
interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims,
demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be
involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the
Securities Act or otherwise

 



171 (hereinafter referred to in this _Section 7.12(c)_ as a "claim" and in the
plural as "claims") based upon, arising out of or resulting from any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any
registration statement under which any Partnership Interests were registered
under the Securities Act or any state securities or Blue Sky laws, in any
preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of such
registration statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or issuer free
writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during
the period the Partnership is required to keep the registration statement
current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is based
upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, such
preliminary, summary or final prospectus or any free writing prospectus or
such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

 

(d) The provisions of _Section 7.12(a)_ and _Section 7.12(b)_ shall continue
to be applicable with respect to the General Partner (and any of the General
Partners Affiliates) after it ceases to be a general partner of the
Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of
such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for such Holder to
sell all of the Partnership Interests with respect to which it has requested
during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise
filed or that a registration statement be filed; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Partnership shall not be required to file successive registration
statements covering the same Partnership Interests for which registration was
demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of _Section 7.12(c)_
shall continue in effect thereafter.

(e) The rights to cause the Partnership to register Partnership Interests
pursuant to this _Section 7.12_ may be assigned (but only with all related
obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such Partnership
Interests, provided (i) the Partnership is, within a reasonable time after
such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such
transferee or assignee and the Partnership Interests with respect to which
such registration rights are being assigned; and (ii) such transferee or
assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms set
forth in this _Section 7.12_.

(f) Any request to register Partnership Interests pursuant to this _Section
7.12_ shall (i) specify the Partnership Interests intended to be offered and
sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such Persons present
intent to offer such Partnership Interests for distribution, (iii) describe
the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale of Partnership Interests,
and (iv) contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such
information and materials and take all action as may be required in order to
permit the Partnership to comply with all applicable requirements in
connection with the registration of such Partnership Interests.

(g) The Partnership may enter into separate registration rights agreements
with the General Partner or any of its Affiliates or Holdings.

 



172 Section 7.13 _Reliance by Third Parties_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner and
any officer of the General Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on
behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has full power and authority to
encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of
the Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the
Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner or any such officer as if it were the Partnerships sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses or other remedies
that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any
action of the General Partner or any such officer in connection with any such
dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or any
such officer or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms
of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or
expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or any such officer or
its representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or
its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every
Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the
execution and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this
Agreement was in full force and effect, (b) the Person executing and
delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and
empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership and (c) such
certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in
accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon
the Partnership.

ARTICLE VIII 

BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS

 

Section 8.1 _Records and Accounting_.

 

The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept at the principal office of
the Partnership appropriate books and records with respect to
the Partnerships business, including all books and records necessary to
provide to the Limited Partners any information required to be provided
pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_. Any books and records maintained by or on
behalf of the Partnership in the regular course of its business, including
the record of the Record Holders of Units or other Partnership Interests,
books of account and records of Partnership proceedings, may be kept on, or be
in the form of, computer disks, hard drives, magnetic tape, photographs,
micrographics or any other information storage device; _provided_ , that the
books and records so maintained are convertible into clearly legible written
form within a reasonable period of time. The books of the Partnership shall
be maintained, for financial reporting purposes, on an accrual basis in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Partnership shall not be required to keep books
maintained on a cash basis and the General Partner shall be permitted
to calculate cash-based measures, including Operating Surplus and Adjusted
Operating Surplus, by making such adjustments to its accrual basis books to
account for non-cash items and other adjustments as the General Partner
determines to be necessary or appropriate.

Section 8.2 _Fiscal Year_.

 

The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be a fiscal year ending December 31\.

 



173 Section 8.3 _Reports_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 120 days after the
close of each fiscal year of the Partnership, the General Partner shall cause
to be mailed or made available, by any reasonable means to each Record Holder
of a Unit or other Partnership Interest as of a date selected by the General
Partner, an annual report containing financial statements of the Partnership
for such fiscal year of the Partnership, presented in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, including a balance sheet and statements of operations, Partnership
equity and cash flows, such statements to be audited by a firm of independent
public accountants selected by the General Partner.

(b) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the close
of each Quarter except the last Quarter of each fiscal year, the General
Partner shall cause to be mailed or made available, by any reasonable means to
each Record Holder of a Unit or other Partnership Interest, as of a date
selected by the General Partner, a report containing unaudited financial
statements of the Partnership and such other information as may be required by
applicable law, regulation or rule of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, or as the General Partner
determines to be necessary or appropriate.

(c) The General Partner shall be deemed to have made a report available to
each Record Holder as required by this _Section 8.3_ if it has either (i)
filed such report with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system, or any successor system, and such report is
publicly available on such system or (ii) made such report available on any
publicly available website maintained by the Partnership.

 

ARTICLE IX

TAX MATTERS 

Section 9.1 _Tax Returns and Information_.

 

The Partnership shall timely file all returns of the Partnership that are
required for federal, state and local income tax purposes on the basis of the
accrual method and the taxable period or years that it is required by law to
adopt, from time to time, as determined by the General Partner. In the event
the Partnership is required to use a taxable period other than a year ending
on December 31, the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to change
the taxable period of the Partnership to a year ending on December 31\. The
tax information reasonably required by Record Holders for federal, state and
local income tax reporting purposes with respect to a taxable period shall be
furnished to them within 90 days of the close of the calendar year in which
the Partnerships taxable period ends. The classification, realization and
recognition of income, gain, losses and deductions and other items shall be
on the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 



174 Section 9.2 _Tax Elections_.

 

(a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation
of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General Partners
determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited
Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for
the purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code,
the General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a
convention whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner
Interest will be deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited
Partner Interests on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited
Partner Interests are listed or admitted to trading during the calendar month
in which such transfer is deemed to occur pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_
without regard to the actual price paid by such transferee.

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine
whether the Partnership should make any other elections permitted by the Code.

 

Section 9.3 _Tax Controversies_.

 

Subject to the provisions hereof, the General Partner is designated as the Tax
Matters Partner (as defined in Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code as in effect
prior to the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) and the
"partnership representative" (as defined in Section 6223 of the Code following
the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) and is authorized and
required to represent the Partnership (at the Partnerships expense) in
connection with all examinations of the Partnerships affairs by tax
authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and
to expend Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated
therewith. In its capacity as "partnership representative," the General
Partner shall exercise, in its sole discretion, any and all authority of the
"partnership representative" under the Code, including, without limitation,
(i) binding the Partnership and its Partners with respect to tax matters and
(ii) determining whether to make any available election under Section 6226 of
the Code. Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General Partner and to do
or refrain from doing any or all things reasonably required by the General
Partner to conduct such proceedings. Each Partner agrees that notice of or
updates regarding tax controversies shall be deemed conclusively to have been
given or made by the Tax Matters Partner if the Partnership has either (a)
filed the information for which notice is required with the Commission via its
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system and such information
is publicly available on such system or (b) made the information for which
notice is required available on any publicly available website maintained by
the Partnership, whether or not such Partner remains a Partner in the
Partnership at the time such information is made publicly available.

The General Partner shall amend the provisions of this Agreement as
appropriate to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations
implementing the partnership audit, assessment and collection rules adopted by
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, including any amendments to those rules.

Section 9.4 _Withholding_.

 

(a) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of,
all or less than all of the Partners, either as a distribution of cash to
such Partners or as a general expense of the Partnership, as determined
appropriate under the circumstances by the General Partner.

 



175 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that may be required to cause the
Partnership and other Group Members to comply with any withholding
requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local
law including pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To
the extent that the Partnership is required or elects to withhold and pay over
to any taxing authority any amount resulting from the allocation or
distribution of income to any Partner (including by reason of Section 1446 of
the Code), the General Partner may treat the amount withheld as a distribution
of cash pursuant to _Section 6.3_ in the amount of such withholding from such
Partner.

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section
11.1(a)(v)_, _Section 11.1 (a)(vi)(A)_,  _Section 11.1(a)(vi)(B)_, _Section
11.1(a)(vi)(C)_ or _Section 11.1(a)(vi)(E)_ occurs, the withdrawing General
Partner shall give notice to the Limited Partners within 30 days after such
occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of Withdrawal
described in this _Section 11.1_ shall result in the withdrawal of the
General Partner from the Partnership.

 

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence
of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
under the following circumstances: (i) at any time before 12:00 midnight,
Central Time, on June 30, 2021, the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by
giving at least 90 days advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the
Limited Partners; _provided_ , that prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a
majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the
General Partner and its Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the
Partnership an Opinion of Counsel ("Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel") that such
withdrawal (following the selection of the successor General Partner) would
not result in the loss of the limited liability under the Delaware Act of any
Limited Partner or any Group Member or cause any Group Member to be treated as
an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or

at least 90 days advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited
Partners, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in the notice,
if at the time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than
the General Partner and its Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or
control at least 50% of the Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General
Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal
shall also constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner
or managing member, if any, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members. If the General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal, the holders of a
Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, elect a
successor General Partner. The Person so elected as successor General Partner
shall automatically become the successor general partner or managing member,
to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General
Partner is a general partner or a managing member. If, prior to the effective
date of the General Partners withdrawal pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_, a
successor is not selected by the Unitholders as provided herein or the

 



178 Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership
shall be dissolved in accordance with _Section 12.1_ unless the business of
the Partnership is continued pursuant to _Section 12.2_. Any successor
General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.1_
shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 10.2_.

Section 11.2 _Removal of the General Partner_.

 

The General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by (i) the
Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including
Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates) voting as a single
class, and (ii) prior to August 9, 2018, so long as the holders of the
Incentive Distribution Rights as of August 9, 2013, together with
their Affiliates, continue to own a majority of the Incentive Distribution
Rights, the holders of a majority of the Incentive Distribution Rights. Any
such action by such holders for removal of the General Partner must also
provide for the election of a successor General Partner by (i) the
Unitholders holding a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (including, in
each case, Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates), and (ii)
prior to August 9, 2018, so long as the holders of the Incentive Distribution
Rights as of August 9, 2013, together with their Affiliates, continue to own a
majority of the Incentive Distribution Rights, the holders of a majority of
the Incentive Distribution Rights. Such removal shall be effective
immediately following the admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to
_Section 10.2_. The removal of the General Partner shall also automatically
constitute the removal of the General Partner as general partner or managing
member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the
General Partner is a general partner or a managing member. If a Person is
elected as a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this 
_Section 11.2_, such Person shall, upon admission pursuant to _Section
10.2_, automatically become a successor general partner or managing member, to
the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General
Partner is a general partner or a managing member. The right of the holders
of Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner shall not exist or be
exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the
matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.2_ shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

 

Section 11.3 _Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General
Partner_.

 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the
General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where
Cause does not exist, if the successor General Partner is elected in
accordance with the terms of _Section 11.1_ or  _Section 11.2_, the
Departing General Partner shall have the option, exercisable prior to the
effective date of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner,
to require its successor to purchase its General Partner Interest and its or
its Affiliates general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if any, in
the other Group Members and all of its or its Affiliates Incentive
Distribution Rights (collectively, the "Combined Interest" in exchange for an
amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such
amount to be determined and payable as of the effective date of its withdrawal
or removal. If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders
under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws
under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a
successor General

 



179 Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of _Section 11.1_ or _Section
11.2_ (or if the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to
_Section 11.2_ and the successor General Partner is not the former General
Partner), such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior to the
effective date of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner
(or, in the event the business of the Partnership is continued, prior to the
date the business of the Partnership is continued), to purchase the Combined
Interest for such fair market value of such Combined Interest. In either
event, the Departing General Partner shall be entitled to receive all
reimbursements due such Departing General Partner pursuant to _Section 7.4_,
including any employee-related liabilities (including severance liabilities),
incurred in connection with the termination of any employees employed by the
Departing General Partner or its Affiliates (other than any Group Member) for
the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group Members.

 

For purposes of this _Section 11.3(a)_, the fair market value of the Combined
Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General
Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the
effective date of such Departing General Partners withdrawal or removal, by
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert
selected by the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn,
may rely on other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive
as to such matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert within 45 days after the
effective date of such withdrawal or removal, then the Departing General
Partner shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert, the Departing General Partners successor shall designate
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such
firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment banking
firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm
or other independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the
Combined Interest. In making its determination, such third independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert may consider the value of
the Units, including the then current trading price of Units on any National
Securities Exchange on which Units are then listed or admitted to trading, the
value of the Partnerships assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing
General Partner, the value of the Incentive Distribution Rights and the
General Partner Interest and other factors it may deem relevant.

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
_Section 11.3(a)_, the Departing General Partner (and its Affiliates, if
applicable) shall become a Limited Partner and the Combined Interest shall be
converted into Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment
banking firm or other independent expert selected pursuant to _Section
11.3(a)_, without reduction in such Partnership Interest (but subject to
proportionate dilution by reason of the admission of its successor). Any
successor General Partner shall indemnify the Departing General Partner as to
all debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on
which the Departing General Partner becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes
of this Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest to Common Units will be
characterized as if the Departing General Partner (and its Affiliates, if
applicable) contributed the Combined Interest to the Partnership in exchange
for the newly issued Common Units.

 



180 (c) If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms 
_Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ (or if the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to _Section 12.2_ and the successor General Partner is not
the former General Partner) and the option described in  _Section 11.3(a)_
is not exercised by the party entitled to do so, the successor General Partner
shall, at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership, contribute
to the Partnership cash in the amount equal to the product of (x) the
quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Percentage Interest of the General
Partner Interest of the Departing General Partner by (B) a percentage equal to
100% less the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of
the Departing General Partner and (y) the Net Agreed Value of the
Partnerships assets on such date. In such event, such successor General
Partner shall, subject to the following sentence, be entitled to its
Percentage Interest of all Partnership allocations and distributions to which
the Departing General Partner was entitled in respect of its General Partner
Interest. In addition, the successor General Partner shall cause this
Agreement to be amended to reflect that, from and after the date of such
successor General Partners admission, the successor General Partners
interest in all Partnership distributions and allocations shall be its
Percentage Interest.

 

Section 11.4 _Extinguishment of Cumulative Common Unit Arrearages_.

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, if the General Partner is
removed as general partner of the Partnership under circumstances where Cause
does not exist and Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates are
not voted in favor of such removal, (i) all Cumulative Common Unit Arrearages
on the Common Units will be extinguished and (ii) the General Partner will
have the right to convert its General Partner Interest (represented by
Notional General Partner Units) and its Incentive Distribution Rights into
Common Units or to receive cash in exchange therefor in accordance with
_Section 11.3_. 

Section 11.5 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners_.

 

No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;
_provided_ , _however_ , that when a transferee of a Limited Partners
Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner
Interest so transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a
Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

 

Section 12.1 _Dissolution_.

 

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Additional Limited
Partners or by the admission of a successor General Partner in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the removal or withdrawal of the
General Partner, if a successor General Partner is elected pursuant to
_Section 11.1_, _Section 11.2_ or _Section 12.2_, the Partnership shall
not be dissolved and such successor General Partner is hereby authorized to,
and shall, continue the business of the Partnership. Subject to _Section
12.2_, the Partnership shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up,
upon: 

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in _Section
11.1(a)_, unless a successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to this
Agreement;

 



181 (b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is
approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or

(d) at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the Partnership is
continued without dissolution in accordance with the Delaware Act.

Section 12.2 _Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution_.

 

Upon an Event of Withdrawal caused by (a) the withdrawal or removal of the
General Partner as provided in _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ or _Section
11.1(a)(iii)_ and the failure of the Partners to select a successor to such
Departing General Partner pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, then
within 90 days thereafter, or (b) an event constituting an Event of
Withdrawal as defined in _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section 11.1(a)(v)_ or
_Section 11.1(a)(vi)_, then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within
180 days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to continue the
business of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement by appointing, effective as of the date of the Event of Withdrawal,
as a successor General Partner a Person approved by the holders of a Unit
Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable time period as
set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to
wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made, then:

 

(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier
dissolved in accordance with this Article XII;

 

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then
the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner
provided in _Section 11.3_; and

(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as
General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in
writing to be bound by this Agreement;

_provided_ , that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a
successor General Partner and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited Partner
and (y) neither the Partnership nor any Group Member would be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for
U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue
(to the extent not already so treated or taxed).

 

Section 12.3 _Liquidator_.

 

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner shall select one or
more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General
Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as
may be approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common
Units. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree

 



182 not to resign at any time without 15 days prior notice and may be removed at
any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of
at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. Upon dissolution, removal
or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who
shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original
Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least
a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. The right to approve a successor
or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to
refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the
manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XII, the
Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may
exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties
hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms
of this Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations,
contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the
limitation on sale set forth in _Section 7.3_) necessary or appropriate to
carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during
the period of time required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the
Partnership as provided for herein.

Section 12.4 _Liquidation_.

 

The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership,
discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner
and over such period as determined by the Liquidator, subject to Section
17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:

(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by
distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator
and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in
kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of
_Section 12.4(c)_ to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and
contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to
the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of
the Partnerships assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an
immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnerships assets
would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The
Liquidator may distribute the Partnerships assets, in whole or in part, in
kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue
loss to the Partners.

 

(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of  _Section
12.3_) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution
rights under _Article VI_. With respect to any liability that is contingent,
conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable,
the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be applied as
additional liquidation proceeds.

(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to (i) discharge
liabilities as provided in  _Section 12.4(b)_, (ii) satisfy liquidation
preferences of the Series A Preferred Units provided for under _Section
5.12(b)(iv)_, (iii) satisfy liquidation preferences of the Series C Preferred
Units provided for under  _Section 5.14(b)(iv)_, (iv) satisfy liquidation
preferences of the Series D Preferred Units provided for under _Section
5.15(b)(iv)_, and (v) satisfy liquidation preferences of the Series E
Preferred Units provided for under

 



183 _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_ shall be distributed to the Partners (including the
holder of the HPIP Equity Interest) in accordance with, and to the extent of,
the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined
after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other than those
made by reason of distributions pursuant to this _Section 12.4(c)_) for the
taxable period of the Partnership during which the liquidation of the
Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution
shall be made by the end of such taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days
after said date of such occurrence).

 

Section 12.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_.

 

Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as
provided in _Section 12.4_ in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of
the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than
the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may
be necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

Section 12.6 _Return of Contributions_.

 

The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to
enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the
Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

 

Section 12.7 _Waiver of Partition_.

 

To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right
to partition of the Partnership property.

 

Section 12.8 _Capital Account Restoration_.

 

No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance
in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. The General
Partner shall be obligated to restore any negative balance in its Capital
Account upon liquidation of its interest in the Partnership by the end of the
taxable period of the Partnership during which such liquidation occurs.

 

Section 12.9 _Series A Liquidation Value, Series C Liquidation Value, Series D
Liquidation Value and Series E Liquidation Value_. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Series A Preferred Units, the Series C Preferred Units, the
Series D Preferred Units and the Series E Preferred Units shall have the
rights, preferences and privileges set forth in _Section 5.12(b)(iv)_,
_Section 5.14(b)(iv)_, _Section 5.15(b)(iv)_ and  _Section 5.16(b)(iv)_,
respectively, upon liquidation of the Partnership pursuant to this Article
XII.

1940, as amended, or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, regardless of whether such
are substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or

Section 13.2 _Amendment Procedures_.

 

Except as provided in _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.3_, all amendments to
this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the requirements contained in
this _Section 13.2_. Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by the
General Partner; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the full extent permitted
by law, the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose or
approve any amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so free of any
duty (including any fiduciary duty) or obligation whatsoever to the
Partnership, any Limited Partner, or any other Person bound by this Agreement
and, in declining to propose or approve an amendment, to the fullest extent
permitted by law shall not be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any
other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any
other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other
law, rule or regulation or at equity. A proposed amendment shall be effective
upon its approval by the General Partner and, except as otherwise provided by
_Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.3_, the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a
greater or different percentage is required under this Agreement. Each
proposed amendment that requires the approval of the holders of a specified
percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set

 



186 forth in a writing that contains the text of the proposed amendment. If such
an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall seek the written approval
of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or call a meeting of the
Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The General
Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any such
proposed amendments. The General Partner shall be deemed to have notified all
Record Holders as required by this _Section 13.2_ if it has either (i) filed
such amendment with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system, or any successor system, and such amendment is
publicly available on such system or (ii) made such amendment available on any
publicly available website maintained by the Partnership.

 

Section 13.3 _Amendment Requirements_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_, no
provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding
Units (including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) or requires a vote
or approval of Partners (or a subset of the Partners) holding a specified
Percentage Interest required to take any action shall be amended, altered,
changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would have the effect of in
the case of any provision of this Agreement other than _Section 11.2_ or
_Section 13.4_, reducing such percentage, unless such amendment is approved
by the written consent or the affirmative vote of holders of Outstanding Units
whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than the voting
requirement sought to be reduced or increased, as applicable or the
affirmative vote of Partners whose aggregate Percentage Interest constitutes
not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced, as applicable.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_, no
amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of (including
requiring any holder of a class of Partnership Interests to make
additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership) any Limited Partner
without its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a result
of an amendment approved pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_, or (ii) enlarge the
obligations of, restrict, change or modify in any way any action by or rights
of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise
payable to, the General Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent,
which consent may be given or withheld at its option.

(c) Except as provided in _Section 14.3_ and _Section 13.1_ (this _Section
13.3(c)_ being subject to the General Partners authority to adopt amendments
to this Agreement without the approval of any Partners as contemplated in
_Section 13.1_), any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on
the rights or preferences of any class of Partnership Interests in relation
to other classes of Partnership Interests must be approved by the holders of
not less than a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class
or series affected. If the General Partner determines an amendment does not
satisfy the requirements of _Section 13.1(d)(i)_ because it adversely affects
one or more classes of Partnership Interests, as compared to other classes of
Partnership Interests, in any material respect, such amendment shall only be
required to be approved by the adversely affected class or classes.

 



187 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to  _Section 13.1_ and except as otherwise provided by
_Section 14.3(b)_, no amendments shall become effective without the approval
of the holders of at least 90% of the Percentage Interests of all Limited
Partners voting as a single class unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion
of Counsel to the effect that such amendment will not affect the limited
liability of any Limited Partner under applicable partnership law of the state
under whose laws the Partnership is organized. 

(e) Except as provided in _Section 13.1_, this _Section 13.3_ shall only be
amended with the approval of Partners (including the General Partner and its
Affiliates) holding at least 90% of the Percentage Interests of all Limited
Partners.

 

Section 13.4 _Special Meetings_.

 

All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be
taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. Special meetings of the
Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners
owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which
a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a special meeting
by delivering to the General Partner one or more requests in writing stating
that the signing Limited Partners wish to call a special meeting and
indicating the general or specific purposes for which the special meeting is
to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited
Partners or within such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the
Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing
agreements or similar requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the
solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall
send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or
indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be held at a time and
place determined by the General Partner on a date not less than 10 days nor
more than 60 days after the time notice of the meeting is given as provided in
_Section 16.1_. Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause
the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and
control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the
Limited Partners limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any
other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

Section 13.5 _Notice of a Meeting_.

 

Notice of a meeting called pursuant to _Section 13.4_ shall be given to the
Record Holders of the class or classes of Units for which a meeting is
proposed in writing by mail or other means of written communication in
accordance with _Section 16.1_. The notice shall be deemed to have been given
at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means of
written communication.

Section 13.6 _Record Date_.

 

For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a
meeting as provided in _Section 13.11_ the General Partner may set a Record
Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a) the
date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any
rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading or U.S. federal
securities laws, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement
of such National Securities Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws

 



188 shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting,
the date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General
Partner to give such approvals. If the General Partner does not set a Record
Date, then (a) the Record Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled
to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners shall be the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
and (b) the Record Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled to give
approvals without a meeting shall be the date the first written approval is
deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner in accordance
with _Section 13.11_.

 

Section 13.7 _Adjournment_.

 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business that might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this _Article
XIII_.

 

Section 13.8 _Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes_.

 

The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, _however_ called and
noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a
meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either
in person or by proxy. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited
Partner attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a
meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of
matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so
included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting.

 

Section 13.9 _Quorum and Voting_.

 

The holders of a majority, by Percentage Interest, of the Partnership
Interests of the class or classes for which a meeting has been
called (including Partnership Interests deemed owned by the General Partner)
represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the Partners
requires approval by holders of a greater Percentage Interest, in which case
the quorum shall be such greater Percentage Interest. At any meeting of the
Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which a
quorum is present, the act of Partners holding Partnership Interests that in
the aggregate represent a majority of the Percentage Interest of those present
in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of
all Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required with
respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which case
the act of the Partners holding Partnership Interests that in the aggregate
represent at least such greater or different percentage shall be required; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, as a matter of law or amendment to this
Agreement, approval by plurality vote of Partners (or any class thereof) is
required to approve any action, no minimum quorum shall be

 



189 required. The Partners present at a duly called or held meeting at which a
quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Partners to leave less than a quorum,
if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by Partners holding
the required Percentage Interest specified in this Agreement. In the absence
of a quorum any meeting of Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the
affirmative vote of Partners with at least a majority, by Percentage Interest,
of the Partnership Interests entitled to vote at such meeting (including
Partnership Interests deemed owned by the General Partner) represented either
in person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as
provided in _Section 13.7_.

 

Section 13.10 _Conduct of a Meeting_.

 

The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the manner
of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of
approvals in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote,
the existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of _Section
13.4_, the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and
the determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in
connection with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall
designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further
designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be
kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner.
The General Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable
law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any
meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing,
including regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment
and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission
and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the
revocation of approvals in writing.

Section 13.11 _Action Without a Meeting_.

If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting, without a
vote and without prior notice, if an approval in writing setting forth the
action so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum
percentage, by Percentage Interest, of the Partnership Interests of the class
or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Partnership
Interests deemed owned by the General Partner), as the case may be, that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
the Limited Partners entitled to vote at such meeting were present and voted
(unless such provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed
or admitted to trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice
of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited
Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify
that any written ballot, if any, submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose
of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership
within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by
the General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all
of the Units held by the Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have failed to receive a ballot for the Units that were not voted. If
approval of the taking of any action by the Limited Partners is solicited by
any Person other than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the written
approvals shall have no force and effect unless and until (a) they are
deposited with the

 



190 Partnership in care of the General Partner and (b) an Opinion of Counsel is
delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such
right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular
matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part
in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership
so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability, and (ii) is
otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights,
duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners. Nothing contained
in this _Section 13.11_ shall be deemed to require the General Partner to
solicit all Limited Partners in connection with a matter approved by the
holders of the requisite Percentage Interest acting by written
consent without a meeting.

Section 13.12 _Right to Vote and Related Matters_.

 

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set
pursuant to _Section 13.6_ shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a
meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to which the
holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to act. All
references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken
by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or
acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Persons account by another
Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation,
or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered,
such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such
Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person
who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume
it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this _Section
13.12(b)_ (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to
the provisions of _Section 4.3_.

Conversion, as applicable, be submitted to a vote of Limited Partners,
whether at a special meeting or by written consent, in either case in
accordance with the requirements of Article XIII. A copy or a summary of the
Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, shall be

5.16(b)(v)_, the Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may
be, shall be approved upon receiving the affirmative vote or consent of the
holders of a Unit Majority unless the Merger Agreement or the Plan of
Conversion, as the case may be, effects an amendment to any provision of this
Agreement that, if contained in an amendment to this Agreement
adopted pursuant to _Article XIII_ , would require for its approval the vote
or consent of the holders of a greater percentage of the Outstanding Units or
of any class of Limited Partners, in which case such greater percentage vote
or consent shall be required for approval of the Merger Agreement or the Plan
of Conversion, as the case may be.

to convert the Partnership or any Group Member into a new limited liability
entity, to merge the Partnership or any Group Member into, or convey all of
the Partnerships assets to, another limited liability entity that shall be
newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or operations at the time
of such merger, conveyance or conversion other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an
Opinion of Counsel that the merger, conveyance or conversion, as the case may
be, would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited
Partner as compared to its limited liability under the Delaware Act or cause
the Partnership or any Group Member to be treated as an association taxable as
a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (to the extent not already treated as such), (ii) the sole
purpose of such merger, conveyance or conversion is to effect a mere change in

Partner approval, to merge or consolidate the Partnership with or into another
entity if (A) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the
merger or consolidation, as the case may be, would not result in the loss
of the limited liability of any Limited Partner as compared to its limited
liability under the Delaware Act or cause the Partnership or any Group Member
to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be
taxed as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (to the extent not
already treated as such), (B) the merger or consolidation would not result in
an amendment to this Agreement, other than any amendments that could be
adopted pursuant to  _Section 13.1_, (C) the Partnership is the Surviving
Business Entity in such merger or consolidation, (D) each Partnership Interest
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation is to be an identical Partnership Interest of the Partnership

194 Section 14.4 _Amendment of Partnership Agreement_.

 

Pursuant to Section 17-211(g) of the Delaware Act, an agreement of merger or
consolidation approved in accordance with this _Article XIV_ may (a) effect
any amendment to this Agreement or (b) effect the adoption of a new
partnership agreement for the Partnership if it is the Surviving Business
Entity. Any such amendment or adoption made pursuant to this  _Section 14.4_
shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
consolidation.

Section 14.5  _Certificate of Merger or Certificate of Conversion_.

Upon the required approval by the General Partner and the Unitholders of
a Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, a
certificate of merger or certificate of conversion, as applicable, shall be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
conformity with the requirements of the Delaware Act.

Section 14.6 _Effect of Merger, Consolidation or Conversion_.

 

(a) At the effective time of the merger:

 

(i) all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the business entities
that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and
causes of action belonging to each of those business entities, shall be vested
in the Surviving Business Entity and after the merger or consolidation shall
be the property of the Surviving Business Entity to the extent they were of
each constituent business entity;

 

(ii) the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in any of
those constituent business entities shall not revert and is not in any way
impaired because of the merger or consolidation; and

(iii) all rights of creditors and all liens on or security interests in
property of any of those constituent business entities shall be preserved
unimpaired; and (iv) all debts, liabilities and duties of those constituent
business entities shall attach to the Surviving Business Entity and may be
enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties
had been incurred or contracted by it.

(b) At the effective time of the conversion:

(i) the Partnership shall continue to exist, without interruption, but in
the organizational form of the converted entity rather than in its prior
organizational form;

(ii) all rights, title, and interests to all real estate and other property
owned by the Partnership shall continue to be owned by the converted entity in
its new organizational form without reversion or impairment, without further
act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but
subject to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon;

 



195 (iii) all liabilities and obligations of the Partnership shall continue to
be liabilities and obligations of the converted entity in its new

RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS

 

Section 15.1 _Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time the
General Partner and its Affiliates hold more than 80% of the total Limited
Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding, the General Partner shall
then have the right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in
part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable
in its sole discretion, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such
Limited Partner Interests of such class then Outstanding held by Persons other
than the General Partner and its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current
Market Price as of the date three days prior to the date that the notice
described in _Section 15.1(b)_ is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates for any such Limited Partner
Interest of such class purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date
that the notice described in _Section 15.1(b)_ is mailed.

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests
granted pursuant to _Section 15.1(a)_, the General Partner shall deliver to
the Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the "Notice of
Election to Purchase") and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of
such Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited Partner
Interests of such class or classes (as of a Record Date selected by the
General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, days prior to the Purchase
Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be

 



196 published for a period of at least three consecutive days in at least two
daily newspapers of general circulation printed in the English language and
published in the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to
Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price (determined in
accordance with _Section 15.1(a)_) at which Limited Partner Interests will
be purchased and state that the General Partner, its Affiliate or the
Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such Limited Partner
Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Limited
Partner Interests in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by
Certificates in exchange for payment, at such office or offices of the
Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be required by any
National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are
listed or admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed
to a Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at his address as reflected in
the records of the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been
given regardless of whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the
Purchase Date, the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the
case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of such Limited Partner
Interests to be purchased in accordance with this _Section 15.1_. If the
Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly given as aforesaid
at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the
Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding sentence has been made
for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject to
purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase Date,
notwithstanding that any Certificate shall not have been surrendered for
purchase, all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner Interests shall
thereupon cease, except the right to receive the purchase price (determined
in accordance with _Section 15.1(a)_) for Limited Partner Interests therefor,
without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates
representing such Limited Partner Interests in the case of Limited
Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, and such Limited Partner
Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General Partner,
its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record books of
the Transfer Agent and the Partnership, and the General Partner or any
Affiliate of the General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests from and
after the Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such
Limited Partner Interests.

(c) In the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, at any
time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding Limited
Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this _Section 15.1_ may
surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the
Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in _Section
15.1(a)_, therefor, without interest thereon.

(d) Nothing in this _Article XV_ shall affect or limit the Partnerships call
rights with respect to Series A-2 Preferred Units, Series C Preferred Units,
Series D Preferred Units and Series E Preferred Units set forth in _Section
5.12(c)_,  _Section 5.14(c)_, _Section 5.15(c)_ and _Section 5.16(c)_,
respectively.

to the Sixth Amended and Restated

 

Agreement of Limited Partnership of

 

American Midstream Partners, LP

 

Form of Warrant

THIS WARRANT HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED OR QUALIFIED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE (THE "STATE
LAWS"). THIS WARRANT MAY NOT BE SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, ENCUMBERED OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR QUALIFICATION OR THE AVAILABILITY OF AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION
FROM THE REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT AND STATE
LAWS EVIDENCED BY AN OPINION OF LEGAL COUNSEL, WHICH OPINION AND LEGAL
COUNSEL ARE SATISFACTORY TO THE PARTNERSHIP.

FORM OF WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON UNITS OF

 

AMERICAN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP

 

This Warrant certifies that, for value received, Magnolia Infrastructure
Holdings, LLC, or its registered assigns (collectively, the "Holder"), is
entitled to purchase from American Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Partnership"), up to 700,000 common units representing
limited partner interests in the Partnership (the "Common Units"), subject to
adjustment as set forth herein, for an exercise price of $22.00 per Common
Unit (the "Exercise Price"). This Warrant shall be exercisable after the date
hereof and on or before the seventh anniversary of the date hereof (the
"Exercise Period").

As used herein, the term "Warrant Exercised Units" refers to the Common Units
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. Terms used but not defined in this
Warrant are defined in the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of the Partnership dated [], 2017, as amended (the "Sixth A/R
Partnership Agreement").

This Warrant, together with all warrants issued upon transfer, exchange or in
replacement hereof pursuant to _Section 4_ (collectively, the "Warrants"), is
subject to the following additional terms, provisions and conditions:

 

Section 1\. _Manner of Exercise; Issuance of Certificates; Payment for Warrant
Exercised Units_. Subject to the provisions hereof, this Warrant may be
exercised by the Holder, in whole or in part, during the Exercise Period by
the surrender of this Warrant, together with a completed Exercise Agreement in
the form attached hereto, to the Partnership during normal business hours on
any Business Day at the Partnerships office in Houston, Texas (or such other
office or agency of the Partnership as it may designate by notice to the
Holder).

 

On a net unit settlement basis, the Warrant Exercised Units shall be deemed to
be issued to the Holder or its designees as the record owner of such Common
Units as of the close of business on the date or dates on which this Warrant
shall have been surrendered and the completed Exercise Agreement delivered
(the "Exercise Date").

 



B-1 The Warrant Exercised Units deemed to be issued on the Exercise Date (which in
no event will be less than zero) (the "Net Unit Amount") shall equal (i) the
number of Common Units with respect to which the Holder is exercising purchase
rights as specified in the Exercise Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the VWAP
(as defined below) on the relevant Exercise Date, minus the Exercise Price,
divided by (iii) the arithmetic average of the daily VWAP (as defined below)
for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the Exercise Date,
provided that any fractional units will be rounded up or down to the nearest
whole Common Unit.

As used herein, the term "VWAP" means the dollar volume-weighted average
price for the Common Units on the New York Stock Exchange during the period
beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York
time, as reported by Bloomberg L.P. through its "Volume at Price" function
or, if the foregoing does not apply, the dollar volume-weighted average price
of the Common Units in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin
board for the Common Units during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New
York time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg
L.P., or, if no dollar volume weighted average price is reported for the
Common Units by Bloomberg L.P. for such hours, the average of the highest
closing bid price and the lowest closing ask price of any of the market
makers for the Common Units as reported in the OTC Link or "pink sheets" by
OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly Pink OTC Markets Inc.). If the VWAP cannot be
calculated for the Common Units on a particular date on any of the foregoing
bases, the VWAP of the Common Units on such date shall be the fair market
value as mutually determined by the Partnership and the Holder.

 

Section 2\. _Certain Actions Prohibited_. The Partnership will not, by
amendment of the Sixth A/R Partnership Agreement or through any
reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue
or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid
the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed
by it hereunder, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying
out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action
as may reasonably be requested by the Holder of this Warrant in order to
protect the exercise privilege of the Holder of this Warrant against dilution
or other impairment, consistent with the tenor and purpose of this Warrant.

 

Section 3\. _Anti-Dilution Provisions and Other Adjustments_. The number and
kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the
Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment, from time to time, as follows:

(a) _Consolidation or Merger_. If, at any time while this Warrant remains
outstanding and unexpired, the Partnership shall (i) consolidate or merge with
any other entity (regardless of whether the Partnership is the continuing or
surviving entity, except that in connection with a consolidation or merger
where the Partnership is not the continuing or surviving entity, the Common
Units shall be changed into or exchanged for units, stock or other securities
of the surviving entity or cash or any other property), (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any other person or entity or
(iii) effect a capital reorganization or reclassification of the Common Units,
the 

 



B-2  Partnership, or such successor entity as the case may be, shall, without
payment of any additional consideration therefor, execute a new warrant
providing that the Holder shall have the right to exercise such new warrant
(upon terms no less favorable to the Holder than those applicable to this
Warrant and subject to the same Exercise Period that is applicable to this
Warrant) and to receive upon such exercise, in lieu of each Common
Unit theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount
of units, shares of stock or other securities, money or property receivable
upon such capital reorganization, reclassification, change, consolidation,
merger or sale or conveyance by the holder of one Common Unit issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant had it been exercised immediately prior to such
capital reorganization, reclassification, change, consolidation, merger or
sale or conveyance. The provisions of this  _Section 3(a)_ shall similarly
apply to successive capital reorganizations, reclassifications, changes,
consolidations, mergers, sales and conveyances.

 

(b) _Dividends and Distributions in Common Units_. If the Partnership shall
pay or make a dividend or other distribution on its Common Units in
additional Common Units, the Exercise Price in effect at the opening of
business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of
unitholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution
(the "Determination Date") shall be reduced by multiplying such Exercise
Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of Common
Units outstanding as of the close of business on the Determination Date
and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the sum of (x) the number of
Common Units outstanding at the close of business on the Determination Date
and (y) the total number of Common Units constituting such dividend or other
distribution. Such reduction shall become effective immediately after the
opening of business on the day following the Determination Date. For the
purposes of this _Section 3(b)_, the number of Common Units at any time
outstanding shall not include Common Units held in the treasury of the
Partnership. The Partnership will not pay any dividend or make any
distribution on Common Units held in the treasury of the Partnership.

 

(c) _Unit Splits or Combinations_. In case the outstanding Common Units shall
be subdivided into a greater number of Common Units, the Exercise Price in
effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such
subdivision becomes effective shall be reduced, and, conversely, in case the
outstanding Common Units shall each be combined into a smaller number of
Common Units, the Exercise Price in effect at the opening of business on the
day following the date upon which such combination becomes effective shall be
increased, in each case, to equal the product of the Exercise Price in effect
on such date and a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of
Common Units outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination,
as applicable, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number
of Common Units outstanding immediately after such subdivision or
combination, as applicable. Such reduction or increase, as applicable, shall
become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day
following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes
effective (the "Alteration Date").



 



B-3 (d) _Reclassifications_. The reclassification or change of Common
Units (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger to
which _Section 3(a)_ shall apply) into securities, including securities other
than Common Units, shall be deemed to involve (i) a distribution of such
securities other than Common Units to all holders of Common Units (and the
effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be the
Determination Date within the meaning of _Section 3(b)_), and (ii) a
subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the number of Common Units
outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of
Common Units outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of
such reclassification shall be deemed to be the Alteration Date within the
meaning of _Section 3(c)_).

(e) _Adjustment of Number of Units_. Upon each adjustment in the Exercise
Price pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)-(d)_, the number of Common Units
purchasable hereunder at the Exercise Price shall be adjusted, to the nearest
whole Common Unit, to the product obtained by multiplying such number of
Common Units purchasable immediately prior to such adjustment in the Exercise
Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the Exercise Price
immediately prior to such adjustment and (ii) the denominator of which shall
be the Exercise Price immediately thereafter.

(f) _Other Provisions Applicable to Adjustments Under This Section_. The
following provisions will be applicable to the making of adjustments in the
Exercise Price provided in this _Section 3_:

 

(i) No adjustment in the Exercise Price need be made under _Section 3(b)_ if
the Partnership issues or distributes (or holds in a segregated manner
pending exercise of this Warrant into Common Units and upon such exercise
distributes) to the Holder the Common Units, evidences of indebtedness,
assets, rights, options or warrants referred to in those paragraphs that such
Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Warrant been exercised for
Common Units prior to the happening of such event or the record date with
respect thereto.

 

(ii) All calculations under this _Section 3_ shall be made to the nearest
1/100th of a cent or to the nearest whole Common Unit, as applicable. No
adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment
(plus any adjustments not previously made by reason of this _Section
3(g)(ii)_) would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such
Exercise Price.

(g) _Notice to the Holder_. The Partnership will deliver to the Holder written
notice, at the same time and in the same manner that it is required to give
such notice under the Sixth A/R Partnership Agreement of any event or
transaction potentially giving rise to an adjustment or modification of the
terms and provisions of the Warrant Exercised Units. The Partnership will
take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the Holder is able
to exercise this Warrant prior to the time of such event or transaction so as
to participate in or vote with respect to such event or transaction.

 



B-4 Section 4\. _Transfer, Exchange and Replacement of Warrant; Representations
and Covenants_.

(a) _Warrant Transferable_. The Holder of this Warrant may transfer and assign
it to any Affiliate, provided that such party is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as presently in
effect. The Holder of this Warrant may not transfer and assign it to any
other person without the prior written consent of the Partnership, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The permitted or approved transfer
of this Warrant and all rights hereunder, in whole or in part, is registrable
at the office or agency of the Partnership referred to in _Section 5_ by the
Holder in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this
Warrant properly endorsed. Upon any permitted or approved transfer of this
Warrant to any person, other than a person who is at that time a holder of
other Warrants, the Partnership shall have the right to require the Holder and
the transferee to make customary representations to the extent reasonably
necessary to assure that the transfer will comply with the Securities Act and
any applicable state securities laws. The Holder of this Warrant, by taking or
holding the same, consents and agrees that this Warrant, when endorsed in
blank, shall be deemed negotiable, and that the Holder, when this Warrant
shall have been so endorsed, may be treated by the Partnership and all other
persons dealing with this Warrant as the absolute owner and holder for any
purpose and as the person entitled to exercise the rights represented by this
Warrant and to the registration of transfer hereof on the books of the
Partnership; but until due presentment for registration of transfer on such
books the Partnership may treat the registered Holder as the owner and holder
of this Warrant for all purposes, and the Partnership shall not be affected by
any notice to the contrary.

 

(b) Warrant Exchangeable for Different Denominations. This Warrant is
exchangeable, upon the surrender of this Warrant by the Holder at the office
or agency of the Partnership referred to in _Section 5_, for new warrants of
like tenor representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the number of
Common Units that may be purchased hereunder, each of such new warrants to be
imprinted with the same legend appearing on the face of this Warrant and to
represent the right to purchase such number of Common Units as shall be
designated by the Holder at the time of such surrender.

 

(c) Replacement of Warrant. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Partnership of the loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of this
Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft, or destruction, upon
delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount
to the Partnership, or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender
and cancellation of this Warrant, the Partnership, at its expense, will
execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new warrant of like tenor.

 

(d) Cancellation; Payment of Expenses. Upon the surrender of this Warrant in
connection with any transfer, exchange, or replacement as provided in
_Section 4(a)-(c)_, this Warrant shall be promptly cancelled by the
Partnership. The Partnership shall pay all taxes (other than securities
transfer taxes) and all other expenses and charges payable in connection with
the preparation, execution and delivery of Warrants pursuant to this _Section
4_.

 



B-5 (e) Register. The Partnership shall maintain, at its office in Houston, Texas
(or such other office or agency of the Partnership as it may designate by
notice to the Holder), a register for this Warrant, in which the Partnership
shall record the name and address of the person in whose name this Warrant has
been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee and each
prior owner of this Warrant.

(f) Representations and Covenants of the Partnership. The Partnership
represents and covenants that all Warrant Exercised Units will, when issued,
be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except to the extent such
nonassessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the
Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act). Upon the exercise of this
Warrant, the issuance of the Warrant Exercised Units will not be subject to
any preemptive or similar rights, other than pursuant to Section 5.8 of
the Sixth A/R Partnership Agreement.

(g) Representations and Covenants of the Holder. The Holder is acquiring this
Warrant and will acquire the Warrant Exercised Units for its own account,
with no present intention of distributing or reselling this Warrant or the
Warrant Exercised Units or any part thereof in violation of applicable
securities laws. The Holder acknowledges that this Warrant has not been, and
when issued the Warrant Exercised Units will not be, registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any state in the United States or any
other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold by such Holder unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act (if applicable to the
transaction) and any other securities laws or unless exemptions from the
registration or other requirements of the Securities Act and any other
securities laws are available for the transaction. The Holder represents that
it is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act, as presently in effect.

 

Section 5\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, and other communications
required or permitted to be given or delivered hereunder to the Holder of
this Warrant shall be in writing, and shall be personally delivered, or shall
be sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, or by delivery
service with proof of delivery, and addressed to the Holder at the address
shown for the Holder on the books of the Partnership, or at such other
address as shall have been furnished to the Partnership by notice from the
Holder. All notices, requests, and other communications required or permitted
to be given or delivered hereunder to the Partnership shall be in writing,

mail, postage prepaid, or by delivery service with proof of delivery, and
addressed to the office of the Partnership at 2103 CityWest Boulevard,

Warrant by notice from the Partnership. Any such notice, request, or
other communication may be sent by facsimile but shall in such case be
subsequently confirmed by a writing personally delivered or sent by certified
or registered mail as provided above. All notices, requests, and other
communications shall be deemed to have been given either at the time of the
delivery thereof to (or the receipt by, in the case of a facsimile) the person
entitled to receive such notice at the address of such person for purposes of
this _Section 5_ or, if mailed, at the completion of the third full day
following the time of such mailing thereof to such address, as the case may
be.

 



B-6 Section 6\. _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS WARRANT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
REGARD TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF SUCH STATE.

 

Section 7\. _Remedies_. The Partnership stipulates that the remedies at law of
the Holder of this Warrant in the event of any default or threatened default
by the Partnership in the performance of or compliance with any of the terms
of this Warrant are not and will not be adequate, and that such terms may be
specifically enforced by a decree for the specific enforcement of
any agreement contained herein or by an injunction against a violation of any
of the terms hereof or otherwise.

Section 8.  _Miscellaneous_.

(a) _Amendments_. This Warrant and any provision hereof may not be changed,
waived, discharged, or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in
writing signed by the party (or any predecessor in interest thereof) against
which enforcement of the same is sought.

 

(b) _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several sections
of this Warrant are inserted for purposes of reference only, and shall not
affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof.

(a) Effective as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement on the date
hereof, the Membership Interests shall be divided into the following three

Agreement.

to a Class C Award Agreement. __

 

(ii) No Capital Contributions will be required to be made by the Class C
Members on account of the issuance of any Class C Membership Interest to such
Members.

(iii) The Class C Membership Interests shall be subject to such vesting,
forfeiture, repurchase and other terms and conditions as may be set forth in
the applicable Class C Award Agreement covering such Class C Membership
Interest, however, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or a Class
C Award Agreement to the contrary, all allocations and distributions under
_Article V_ will be made without regard to whether or not any outstanding
Class C Membership Interest is vested.

 

(iv) All assignees and substitute Members (including spouses and former
spouses) shall be subject to the terms of any applicable Class C Award
Agreement, regardless of the fact that any such assignee or substitute Member
is not an employee or other service provider of the Company (i.e., if the
employment of the Class C Member who assigned the Class C Membership Interest
to such assignee or substitute Member is terminated, the forfeiture,
repurchase and other applicable terms of the Class C Award Agreement shall
apply to such Class C Membership Interest regardless of their ownership).

 

(v) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including
_Section 15.5_, the number of authorized Class C Units shall not be
increased without the consent of the Board, provided that any increase in the
number of authorized Class C Units will not reduce the Sharing Percentage of
the Initial Class C Member without the consent of the Initial Class C Member.

by the Company, the Board may re-issue such forfeited or repurchased Class C
Units to other employees and service providers (including to current Class C
Membership Interest holders).

(vi) The Company and each Class C Member agree to treat any Class C
Membership Interest as separate "Profits Interests" within the meaning of

2001-2 C.B. 191, the Company shall treat a Class C Member holding a Profits
Interest as the owner of such Profits Interest from the date such Profits
Interest is granted, and shall file its IRS Form 1065, and issue appropriate
Schedule K-1s to such Class C Member, allocating to such Class C Member its
distributive share of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
associated with such Profits Interest as if it were fully vested. Each such
Class C Member agrees to take into account such distributive share in
computing its Federal income tax liability for the entire period during which
it holds the Profits Interest. Except

 



16  as required pursuant to a "Determination" as defined in Code Section 1313(a)
or a change in applicable law, the Company and each Class C Member agree not

market value of such Profits Interest issued to a Member, either at the time
of grant of the Profits Interest, or at the time the Profits Interest becomes
substantially vested. The undertakings contained in this _Section
3.1(d)(vi)_ shall be construed in accordance with Section 4 of Rev. Proc.
2001-43. Each Class C Member agrees to timely file an election pursuant to
Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such Class C Members Class C
Membership Interest.

(vii) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 3.1(d)_,  _Section
6.1(b)_ or in a Class C Award Agreement, and notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Class C Members shall not
have, in respect of their Class C Membership Interests, any voting,
control, information or other non-economic rights, except as required by law.

hereunder, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating
the Class C Payout Threshold amount.

(e) _Class D Membership Interests; Class D Member_. __

 

 __(i) The Class D Membership Interests will be represented by Class D units

(ii) An initial Capital Contribution will be deemed made by Holdings LP as
provided in Section 5.8 of the Holdings LP Contribution Agreement on account
of the issuance of Class D Units upon the consummation of the Holdings LP
Contribution.

 

(iii) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 3.1(e)_, _Section
6.1(c)_, _Section 7.1_, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Class D Member shall not have, in respect of
its Class D Membership Interests, any voting, control, information or other
non-economic rights, except as required by law.

 

(iv) Each of Holdings GP and the Class D Member represents, warrants,
covenants and agrees that:

 

(A) From the date of the Holdings LP Contribution Agreement until the date

Voting Control and Holdings GP Voting Control;

(B) Holdings GP shall, or shall cause the Class D Member to, provide written
notice to the Company of any and all Transfers of limited partner interests of
the Class D Member or of member interests of Holdings GP;

 



17 (C) No amendment shall be made to either the Holdings LP Agreement or
the Holdings GP Agreement in a manner that would have the effect of
eliminating the Holdings LP Voting Control or the Holdings GP Voting Control,
as applicable, without the prior written consent of the Class A Member;

 

(D) Neither Holdings GP nor the Class D Member shall authorize or permit EIG
and Tailwater to grant any Person (other than Tailwater or EIG, respectively)
control, directly or indirectly, of the member interests in Holdings GP or the
limited partner interests in the Class D Member, by vote, proxy, waiver,
Transfer or otherwise, and shall cause any such grant or authority to be void
ab initio and of no force or effect; and

(E) Any exercise by the Class D Member of its rights under this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, pursuant to _Section 3.1(g)_ and _Section
6.1(c)_ hereof, shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Holdings LP Agreement and the Holdings GP Agreement as of the date
hereof.

(v) The Class D Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company for any
breach or inaccuracy of the covenants and agreements set forth in _Section

__(f) _Additional Members; New Membership Interests_. Additional Person(s)
may be admitted to the Company as a Member(s) in exchange for such
consideration and upon such other terms and conditions, in each case as
determined by the Class A Members in good faith. The terms of admission or
issuance must specify the Sharing Percentages applicable thereto and may
provide for the creation of different classes or groups of Members having
different rights, powers and duties, including rights, powers and duties that
are senior in preference to existing Members. Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_
and _Section 6.1(c)_, the Class A Members holding not less than a majority of
the then outstanding Class A Membership Interests may reflect the creation of
any new class or group in an amendment to this Agreement indicating the
different rights, powers and duties, and such an amendment shall be deemed
approved and executed by the Members. Any such admission is effective only
after such new Member has executed and delivered to the Members and the
Company an instrument containing the notice address of the new Member and such
new Members ratification of this Agreement and agreement to be bound by it.
Upon the admission of a new Member, _Exhibit A_  will be updated to reflect
such admission. __

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed or (2) offer the Class D Member
the opportunity to purchase such New Securities or participate in any such
loan to the Company on a proportionate basis to the Class D Members Sharing
Percentage at a price per New Security equal to the price per New Security at

their respective Affiliates or, in the case of such a loan, on the same terms
as are agreed by the Class A Member(s) or their Affiliates providing such
loan to the Company.

(ii) Following the date hereof, if the Company proposes to issue, offer
or sell any New Securities to any Class A Member or any Affiliate thereof in

the Company, as directed by the Class A Members, shall either (1) obtain the
prior written consent of the Class D Member, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the issuance, offer or sale
of such New Securities, or (2) obtain the prior approval of such issuance,
offer or sale by the Board, including approval by the majority of the
Independent Committee, or (3) issue such New Securities on terms that are
"fair," with such determination of whether the terms of such New Securities
are "fair" to be deemed satisfied if (A) at least 40% of such New Securities
are purchased by a bona fide third party or (B) an independent financial
advisory firm selected by the Board (which financial advisory firm shall not
have represented the Company or the Partnership as an underwriter, placement
agent or lender within the preceding 24 months) provides an opinion stating
that the terms are fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company.

__(iii) If the Class A Members elect, on behalf of the Company, to provide
preemptive rights to the Class D Member in connection with the proposal to
issue New Securities pursuant to Section 3.1(g)(i)(2) above, then the Company
shall give prompt written notice (the " _New Issue Notice"_ ) of the
Companys proposal to issue, offer or sell New Securities to the Class D
Member. The New Issue Notice shall set forth (A) the New Securities being
offered, (B) the price and terms, if any, upon which the Partnership proposes
to issue, offer and sell the New Securities and (C) the proposed date of the
closing of the issuance of such New Securities. The Class D Member shall have
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the New Issue Notice to submit a written
notice (a " _New Issue Exercise Notice_ ") to the Company. The Class D Member
shall have the right to elect to purchase up to a number of New Securities
equal to the Class D Members _pro rata_ share (based on the ratio of the
Class D Members Sharing Percentage to the aggregate Sharing Percentages of
the Class A Members and Class D Member) at the price and on the terms set
forth in the New Issue Notice. The New Issue Exercise Notice shall set forth
the portion of the New Securities that the Class D Member elects to purchase.

share of any proposed issuance, the Class A Members shall have the opportunity
to increase their participation in such proposed issuance of New Securities
in such amounts as agreed by the Class A Members holding a majority of the

preemptive or other participatory right in any such business opportunity, and
the Class D Member hereby expressly disclaims any and all rights with respect
to any such business opportunity.

3.1(g)(ii)_ shall automatically terminate and will cease to be of any force
and effect thereafter.

 

(h) _Compensatory Issuances_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, but except as set forth in Section 6.1(c)(ii), the Company, as
directed by the Class A Members, may offer or sell New Securities to
directors, employees and service providers of the Company as compensation
without the consent of the Class D Member; _provided_  that any reduction to
the Sharing Percentages of the Class A Members and the Class D Member as a
result of any such issuance shall be _pro rata_ based on their respective
Sharing Percentages prior to such issuance; _provided further_  that the
issuance or sale of any New Securities pursuant to this Section 3.1(h) shall
require the consent of the Class C Member(s) if such issuance or sale reduces
the Sharing Percentage of the Class C Member(s).

debts, obligations or liabilities of the Company solely by reason of being a
member of the Company.

of the Members in their capacities as members of the Company are only as set
forth in this Agreement and as otherwise arise under the Act. Furthermore, the
Members agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
existence of any rights of a Member, or the exercise or forbearance from
exercise of any such rights, shall not create any duties or obligations of
such Member in its capacity as a member of the Company, nor shall such rights
be construed to enlarge or otherwise to alter in any manner the duties and
obligations of such Member.

SECTION 3.3 _Withdrawal_.

 

A Member does not have the right or power to Withdraw.

 

SECTION 3.4 _Access to Information_.

 

 __Each Member shall be entitled to receive, for any purpose reasonably
related to its interest as a Member, any information that it may reasonably
request concerning the Company; _provided, however_ , that this _Section 3.4_
shall not obligate the Company to create any information that does not already
exist at the time of such request (other than to convert existing information
__

 



20 _ _ from one medium to another, such as providing a printout of information
that is stored in a computer database); _provided further_ , _however_ , that
the Class D Member shall only be permitted to receive such information
prepared by the Company pursuant to _Section 12.2_. Each Member shall also
have the right, upon reasonable notice, and at all reasonable times during
usual business hours, to inspect the properties of the Company and to audit,
examine and make copies of the books of account and other records of the
Company for a purpose reasonably related to its interest as a Member;
_provided, however_ , that such information or copies of the Companys books
or records received pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be considered
confidential or a trade secret, and the Class D Member shall not be permitted
to distribute any such information or copies of the Companys books or
records received pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ to any Person holding direct
or indirect interests in the Class D Member other than EIG or Tailwater,
unless after consultation with the Class A Member the Class D Member
reasonably and in good faith determines that such information or copies of
the Companys books or records are not confidential or a trade secret. Such
right may be exercised through any agent or employee of such Member designated
in writing by it or by an independent public accountant, engineer, attorney
or other consultant so designated. All costs and expenses incurred in any
inspection, examination or audit made on such Members behalf shall be borne
by such Member. __

 

ARTICLE IV

 

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

 

SECTION 4.1 _Capital Contributions_.

 

The parties hereto agree that, as of the date hereof, the respective amounts
of the Capital Contributions of the Members with respect to their Membership
Interests and the percentage of such class of Membership Interests owned by
each Member, together with each Members Sharing Percentage, are as set forth
on _Exhibit A_. Except as otherwise described in the last sentence of this 
_Section 4.1_, HPIP and its Affiliates will not make any additional Capital
Contributions to the Company. Upon the admission of a subsequent Member or a
Capital Contribution made by any Member in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Class A Members shall update _Exhibit A_ to reflect the
Capital Contribution and Sharing Percentage attributable to such Member, and
such amendment need be executed only by an authorized officer of the Company.
After admission as a Member, no Member shall be obligated to make any
additional capital contributions to the Company. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, to the extent the Company would not have sufficient
Available Cash to permit the Company to make those distributions described in
_Section 5.5_ in any Quarter in full with respect to the Class C Member, each
of HPIP, AMID Holdings and the Class D Member shall, on a pro rata basis in
accordance with Sharing Percentages, contribute an amount of cash to the
Company within seven (7) Business Days after the end of the immediately
preceding Quarter so that such distributions may be made in full to the Class
C Member.

 



21 SECTION 4.2 _Loans_.

 

If the Company does not have sufficient cash to pay its obligations, any Class
A Member may advance all or part of the needed funds to or on behalf of the
Company. An advance described in this _Section 4.2_ constitutes a loan from
the Member to the Company, bears interest at a lawful rate determined by the
Class A Members holding a majority of the outstanding Class A Membership
Interests from the date of the advance until the date of payment and will not
constitute a Capital Contribution. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the terms and conditions with respect to any loan as
described above, and any other transaction between or among the Company on
the one hand and any Member or any Affiliate thereof on the other hand (i)
shall not be engaged in with a material purpose to disproportionately and
adversely affect, in any material respect, (A) the economic rights of the
Class C Members as compared to the Class A Members or Class D Member or (B)
the economic rights of the Class D Member as compared to the Class A Members,
or (ii) shall have fair market value terms (or be otherwise fair and
reasonable to the Company, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Company)) as reasonably
and in good faith determined by the Company, and any such transaction shall be
disclosed to the Initial Class C Member and the Class D Member in writing
before it is entered into by the Company.

 

SECTION 4.3 _Return of Contributions_.

 

Except as expressly provided herein, no Member is entitled to the return of
any part of its Capital Contributions or to be paid interest in respect of
either its Capital Account or its Capital Contributions. An unrepaid Capital
Contribution is not a liability of the Company or of any Member. A Member is
not required to contribute or to lend any cash or property to the Company to
enable the Company to return any Members Capital Contributions.

SECTION 4.4 _Capital Accounts_.

 

A Capital Account shall be established and maintained for each Member in
accordance with the Allocation Regulations. The Capital Account balances of
each Member shall be made available to a Member upon a written request to the
Company.

DISTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS

 

SECTION 5.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes._

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_, for purposes of
maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Members
among themselves, the Companys items of income, gain, loss and deduction for
any fiscal year shall be allocated and charged to the Members to cause, to the
extent possible, the positive Capital Account balances of the Members (as
adjusted to reflect all allocations under _Section 5.1(b)_ and all
distributions through the end of such fiscal year) to equal, as nearly as
possible:

 

(i) the amount such Member would receive if all assets of the Company at the
end of such taxable period were sold for cash at their Carrying Value, all
liabilities of the Company were satisfied in cash in accordance with their
terms (limited in the case of

 



22  "nonrecourse liabilities" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-1(a)(2)) and "partner nonrecourse debt" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(4)) to the Carrying Value of the property
securing such liabilities), and any remaining cash were distributed to the
Members under _Section 5.4_, _minus_

 

(ii) the sum of (x) the amount, if any, that such Member would be obligated to
contribute to the Partnership immediately after such a hypothetical
liquidation, (y) such Members share of any "partnership minimum gain" (within
the meaning of Section 1.704-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations) determined
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(g), and (z) such Partners
share of "partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain" (within the meaning of
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) determined pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(5), in the case of clauses (y) and (z)
as all computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale described above

 

(b) Prior to making any allocations provided for in _Section 5.1(a)_ above,
the following special allocations shall be made in the following order:

__(i) _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. To the extent required by Section 1.704-2(f)
of the Treasury Regulations, if there is a net decrease in "partnership
minimum gain" (within the meaning of Section 1.704-2(b)(2) of the Treasury
Regulations) in a fiscal year, then each Member shall be specially allocated
items of income and gain (including gross income) arising during that fiscal
year (and if necessary subsequent fiscal years), equal to such Members share
of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain. Allocations pursuant to the
previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Member pursuant thereto. The items to be
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This  _Section 5.1(b)(i)_ is intended to
comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. __

 

 __(ii) _Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain Chargeback_. If there is a net
decrease in "partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain" (within the meaning of
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) in any fiscal year, then
each Member that has a share of the "partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain" as
of the beginning of the fiscal year shall be specially allocated items of
income and gain arising during that fiscal year (and if necessary subsequent
fiscal years) to the extent required by Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury
Regulations. Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in
proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to Member
pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2).
This _Section 5.1(b)(ii)_ is intended to comply with the partner nonrecourse
debt minimum gain chargeback requirement of Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. _ _

 



23 (iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Member receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Company income and gain shall
be specifically allocated to such Member in an amount and manner sufficient
to eliminate, to the extent required by the Allocation Regulations, the
deficit balance, if any, in such Members Adjusted Capital Account created by
such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible.

__(iv) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. If there are any "nonrecourse deductions"
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(b)(1) and
1.704-2(c)) in a fiscal year, then each Member shall be allocated its share of
such nonrecourse deductions in proportion to its respective Sharing
Percentage. __

__(v) _Member Nonrecourse Deductions_. If there are any "partner
nonrecourse deductions" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-2(i)(1)) in a fiscal year, then such deductions shall be allocated to
the Member that bears the economic risk of loss for the "partner nonrecourse
liability" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(4))
to which the deductions are attributable. __

 

 __(vi) _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Member has a deficit
balance in such Members Adjusted Capital Account at the end of any Company
taxable period, such Member shall be specially allocated items of Company
gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible;
_provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this  _Section 5.1(b)(vi)_ shall
be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have a deficit
balance in such Members Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations
provided in this _Section 5.1_ have been tentatively made as if _Section
5.1(b)(iii)_ were not in the Agreement. __

__(vii) _Code Section 754 Adjustment_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b)
of the Code is required, pursuant to the Allocation Regulations, to be taken
into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment
to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment
increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the
Members in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts
are required to be adjusted pursuant to the Allocation Regulations. __

 

 __(c) _Curative Allocation_. The special allocations set forth in _Section
5.1(b)(i)_ through _(vii)_ (the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended
to comply with the Allocation Regulations. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this _Section 5.1_, the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken
into account in allocating items of income, gain, loss and deduction among
the Members such that, to the extent possible, the net amount of allocations
of such items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Member shall be equal to
the net amount that would have been allocated to each Member if the
Regulatory Allocations had not occurred. __

 



24 SECTION 5.2 _Tax Allocations_.

 

For federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by the Code, the
Allocation Regulations or the following sentence, each item of Company
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be allocated among the Members
in the same manner as corresponding items are allocated in _Section 5.1_.
Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein to the contrary, in
accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, Company items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be
allocated to take into account any variation between the Companys tax basis
in Company Property and its Carrying Value. Any elections or other decisions
relating to such allocations shall be made by the Tax Matters Member in any
manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement,
provided, that the Company shall use the remedial allocation method set forth
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d). Allocations pursuant to this
_Section 5.2_ are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes, and
shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any
Members Capital Account, share of allocations pursuant to _Section 5.1_, or
distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.3 _Varying Interests_.

 

All items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit shall be allocated, and
all distributions shall be made, to the Persons shown on the records of the
Company to have been Members as of the last calendar Day of the period for
which the allocation or distribution is to be made. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if during any taxable year there is a change in any Members
Sharing Percentage, the Members agree that their allocable shares of such
items for the taxable year shall be determined on any reasonable method
determined by the Class A Members in their sole discretion to be permissible
under Code Section 706 and the related Treasury Regulations to take account
of the Members varying Sharing Percentages.

SECTION 5.4 _Distributions_. 

Except as otherwise provided in _Section 13.2_ or Section 14.10, and
expressly subject to _Section 5.5_,  _Section 5.6_ and the last sentence of
this _Section 5.4_, cash may be distributed at such time and in such amounts
as the Class A Members holding a majority of the then-outstanding Class A
Membership Interests shall determine to the Members in accordance with their
then respective Sharing Percentages. Such distributions shall be made
concurrently to the Members (or their Assignees) as reflected on the books of
the Company on the date set for purposes of such distribution; _provided,
however_ , that within fifty (50) days following the end of each Quarter, an
amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall be
distributed in accordance with this _Article V_. Distributions to the
Members shall be made simultaneously in accordance with each such Members
Sharing Percentage (at the time the amounts of such distributions are
determined). For the avoidance of doubt, if any amount is distributed by
the Company pursuant to or in accordance with this _Section 5.4_ (including
by way of _Section 13.2(a)(iii)(C)_) prior to Class C Payout having occurred,
and such distribution is in an amount in excess of the amount that causes
Class C Payout to have occurred, such distribution shall be bifurcated and
distributed in accordance with the Sharing Percentages pre- and post- Class C
Payout, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything is this _Section 5.4_ to the
contrary, to the extent HPIP, AMID Holdings or the Class D Member make any
Capital Contributions described in the last sentence of _Section 4.1_,
amounts otherwise distributable pursuant to this

 



25   _Section 5.4_ shall first be distributed to HPIP, AMID Holdings or the
Class D Member in an amount equal to such Capital Contributions (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any distributions to HPIP, AMID Holdings or the Class D
Member pursuant to this sentence will not reduce or otherwise impact HPIPs,
AMID Holdings or the Class D Members entitlement to any subsequent or other
contemporaneous distributions).

SECTION 5.5 _Tax Distributions_.

 

Prior to any distributions being made by the Company pursuant to _Section
5.4_ in any Quarter, the Company shall within ten (10) Business Days after
the end of the immediately preceding Quarter, only to the extent of Available
Cash, distribute to each Member an amount equal to the Hypothetical Tax Amount
with respect to such Member and such immediately preceding Quarter, provided,
however, that for purposes of calculating the Hypothetical Tax Amount with
respect to such immediately preceding calendar quarter and making such
distribution within ten (10) Business Days after the end of such Quarter,
the net amount of cumulative income and gain, less losses, deductions and
credits, estimated by the Company to be allocable to such Member for federal
income tax purposes for such quarter will be determined based on the average
of the Partnerships net cumulative income and gain, less losses, deductions
and credits (taking into account the character of income and loss and the
deductibility of state and local taxes for federal income tax purposes) over
the four (4) prior Quarters. As soon as practicable after the making of any
distribution under the preceding sentence (or the making of the determination
that no such distribution was required), the Company shall determine an actual
estimate of the net amount of cumulative income and gain, less losses,
deductions and credits allocable to each Member (taking into account the
character of income and loss and the deductibility of state and local taxes
for federal income tax purposes) for federal income purposes for the Quarter
in question (an " _Actual Estimate_ "), and (i) if the distribution that was
made was less than what a Member should have received based upon such Actual
Estimate, the Company will promptly, only to the extent of Available
Cash, distribute to such Member an amount equal to such deficit, or (ii) if
the distribution that was made was more than what a Member should have
received based upon such Actual Estimate, then subsequent distributions under
this  _Section 5.5_ shall be reduced (but not below zero) until such excess
has been recouped. To the extent the Company does not have sufficient
Available Cash to make any distributions described in this _Section 5.5_,
such distributions shall be made in the same proportion as the amounts
otherwise distributable pursuant to this _Section 5.5_; _provided, however_ ,
that to the extent HPIP, AMID Holdings or the Class D Member make any Capital
Contributions described in the last sentence of _Section 4.1_, such amounts
so contributed shall be distributed entirely to the Class C Member. Any amount
distributed to any Member pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be treated as
an advance against the next subsequent distributions to such Member (whether
in such Quarter or any future Quarter) pursuant to or in accordance with
_Section 5.4_ (including by way of _Section 13.2(a)(iii)(C)_), and shall
reduce such next subsequent distributions to such Member on a dollar-for-
dollar basis. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to contrary, the
Company shall not be required to make any distribution under this _Section
5.5_ with respect to any Quarter if the Class C Member is not entitled to a
distribution under this _Section 5.5_ with respect to such Quarter.

 



26 SECTION 5.6 _Limitations on Distributions_.

 

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not make a distribution to any Member on account of its
interest in the Company if such distribution would violate any Applicable Law.

SECTION 6.1  _Management_.

__(a) _Management by the Class A Member_. Except as set forth in _Section
6.1(b)_ and  _Section 6.1(c)_, the management of the Company is fully
reserved to the Class A Members, and the Company shall not have "managers" as
that term is used in the Act. The powers of the Company shall be exercised by
or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Company shall
be managed under the direction of, the Class A Members acting by the holders
of a majority of the then-outstanding Class A membership Interests, who,

decisions and take all actions for the Company or other Persons. __

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, including this _Section 6.1_, to
the contrary, the consent of any Member other than a Class A Member shall not
be required for any sale or transfer of the Company or any of its assets
(including any portion of the Incentive Distribution Rights) to (i) any member
of the Partnership Group in exchange for any partnership interests or other
equity interests in the Partnership or any other member of the Partnership
Group or (ii) any Person that is not an Affiliate of the Class A Members. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership Group shall not be deemed an
Affiliate of the Class A Member for purposes of the foregoing sentence.

to the contrary, including, without limitation, anything in _Section 3.1(f)_
to the contrary, without the prior written consent of the Class C Members
holding a majority of Class C Units, but specifically including the Initial
Class C Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, the Company shall not (directly or through any Subsidiaries): __

 

(i) create or issue any New Securities to the extent such New Securities would
reduce the Sharing Percentage of any Class C Member hereunder; or

(ii) take any action, except with respect to the Companys exercise of
preemptive rights provided to the Company pursuant to the Partnership
Agreement, that would result in the issuance of any security of the
Partnership to an Affiliate of a Class A Member, the issuance of which would
have a material and disproportionate adverse effect on the Class C Members as
compared to the Class A Members, without the approval of the transaction in
accordance with Section 7.9 of the Partnership Agreement (including approval
of the Conflicts Committee); or

 



27 (iii) merge, consolidate, combine or engage in any other restructuring with
any other Person if a material purpose of such transaction is to materially
and adversely affect the rights or obligations of any Class C Member in a
manner that would require the consent of such Class C Member pursuant to the
last sentence of  _Section 15.5_ if such result were instead achieved or to
be achieved pursuant to an amendment or proposed amendment to this Agreement
or the Delaware Certificate, without first obtaining the consent described
therein.

 

 __(c) _Consent Rights of the Class D Member_. Without the prior written
consent of the Class D Member, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company shall not (directly or through
any Subsidiaries): __

(i) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $50,000,000
(excluding accrued and unpaid interest thereon) at any time outstanding that
has a preference as to payment or any rights upon liquidation of the Company
that are senior to the Class D Membership Interests, provided that the
foregoing restriction on the incurrence of indebtedness shall not apply to
indebtedness of any member of the Partnership Group; or

 

(ii) amend, restate or waive any provision of this Agreement in a manner that
would (A) increase or extend any financial obligation or liability of the
Class D Member hereunder, (B) materially and adversely affect the rights,
privileges and preferences of the Class D Member in relation to those of the
Class A Members or (C) other than in accordance with this Agreement,
including _Section 3.1(f)_, _Section 3.1(g)_ and _Section 3.1(h)_, reduce
the Sharing Percentage of the Class D Member or (D) amend the last sentence of
_Section 15.5_ in a manner that is materially adverse to the Class D Member.

_provided, however_ , that if at any time EIG and Tailwater fail to
collectively hold Holdings LP Voting Control or Holdings GP Voting Control,
the Class D Members rights pursuant to _Section 6.1(c)(i)_ shall
automatically terminate and will cease to be of any force and effect
thereafter. __

 

SECTION 6.2 _Delegation_.

 

Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(c)_ and _Section 6.4_ and without
limiting the power and authority of the Class A Members to manage the
business and affairs of the Company pursuant to the Act and this Agreement,
the Class A Members, acting by the holders of a majority of the then-
outstanding Class A Membership Interests, shall have the power and authority
to delegate to one or more other Persons the Class A Members rights and power
to manage and control the business and affairs, or any portion thereof, of the
Company, including to delegate to agents, officers and employees of the Class
A Members or their respective Affiliates.

 



28 SECTION 6.3 _Board of Directors_.

 

 __Except to the extent specifically reserved to the Members in this
Agreement, the Members hereby delegate to the Board of Directors of the
Company (the " _Board_ ") all power and authority related to the Companys
management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership Group.
__

 

SECTION 6.4 _Powers Reserved for the Class A Members_. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this Agreement except  _Section 6.1(b)_ and
_Section 6.1(c)_:

(a) the Class A Members shall have exclusive authority over the
internal business and affairs of the Company that do not relate to management
and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership Group, and the
Board and the Officers shall have no authority to act with respect to any
matter that does not relate to the management and control of the business and
affairs of the Partnership Group except as may be expressly authorized and
directed from time to time by members holding a majority of the Class A
Membership Interests. For illustrative purposes, the internal business and
affairs of the Company where the Class A Members shall have exclusive
authority include (i) the amount and timing of distributions paid by the
Company, (ii) the prosecution, settlement or management of any claim made
directly against the Company and not involving or relating to the Partnership
Group, (iii) the decision to sell, convey, transfer or pledge any asset of the
Company, (iv) the decision to amend, modify or waive any rights relating to
the assets of the Company, (v) the voting of, or exercise of other rights with

enter into any agreement to incur an obligation of the Company, other than an
agreement entered into for and on behalf of any Group Member for which the
Company is liable exclusively by virtue of the Companys capacity as general
partner of the Partnership; and

(b) without obtaining approval of the Class A Members holding a majority of
the Class A Membership Interests, the Company shall not, and shall not take
any action to cause any Group Member to, (i) sell all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company or such Group Member, (ii) merge, consolidate or
convert the organizational form of the Company, the Partnership or any other
Group Member that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary, (iii) to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, dissolve, liquidate or wind-up the

Subsidiary, (iv) make or consent to a general assignment for the benefit of
its respective creditors, (v) file or consent to the filing of any Bankruptcy,
(vi) make any election to be classified as other than a partnership or a
disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (vii) enter into any
hedging transactions that are not in compliance with FAS 133 or (viii) take
various actions similar to those described in any of _clauses (i)_ through
_(vii)_ of this _Section 6.4(b)_.

 



29 ARTICLE VII

 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 

SECTION 7.1 _Number; Qualification; Tenure_.

 

 __(a) Subject to _Section 7.1(b)_, the number of directors constituting the
Board shall be between one and eleven (each a " _Director_ " and,
collectively, the " _Directors_ "), as such number may be fixed from time to
time pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of Directors. A Director
need not be a Member. Nine (9) of the Directors shall be elected or approved
by the Class A Members at an annual meeting of the Class A Members and, for so
long as (A) the Sharing Percentage of the Class D Member is 10% or more and
(B) EIG and Tailwater collectively hold Holdings LP Voting Control and
Holdings GP Voting Control, two (2) of the Directors shall be appointed by the
Class D Member (the " _Class D Directors_ ") and shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Class A Members. Each Person appointed or elected as a
Director of the Company shall serve for a term of one year (or until such
Persons earlier death, resignation or removal from office) or until such
Persons successor is elected and qualified (or his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal from office) by the Members entitled to elect and
qualify such successor. The number of Directors on the Board as of the date of
this Agreement shall be eleven (11) and the names of the Directors of
the Company as of the date hereof are listed on _Exhibit B_. For so long as
the Class D Member has the right to appoint the Class D Directors as provided
in the second sentence of this _Section 7.1(a)_, if the Board reduces the
number of Directors on the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
majority of Directors, any such reduction shall not affect the right of the
Class D Member to appoint two Class D Directors. __

 

(b) If the Sharing Percentage of the Class D Member is less than 10% or EIG
and Tailwater cease at any time to collectively hold either Holdings LP
Voting Control or Holdings GP Voting Control, then (i) the Class D Directors
shall automatically be removed from their positions as Directors and (ii)
thereafter, the number of directors constituting the Board
shall automatically and immediately be decreased by two.

SECTION 7.2 _Regular Meetings_.

 

Regular quarterly and annual meetings of the Board shall be held at such time
and place as shall be designated from time to time by resolution of the
Board. Notice of such regular quarterly and annual meetings shall not be
required.

A special meeting of the Board may be called at any time at the written
request of (a) the Chairman of the Board, (b) a majority of the Independent

sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if in writing and when
delivered by hand, courier or overnight delivery service, three days after
being mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with
appropriate postage prepaid, and when received in the form of an 

 



30  email or facsimile, and shall be directed to the mailing address, email
address or facsimile number as such Director shall designate by notice to the
Company. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Board need be specified in the notice of
such meeting, except for amendments to this Agreement, as provided herein.

 

(c) Attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute waiver of notice of
such meeting, except where such Director attends the meeting for the express
purpose of objecting to the transaction of business on the ground that the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A meeting may be held at any time
without notice if all the Directors are present or if those not present waive
notice of the meeting either before or after such meeting.

SECTION 7.5 _Action By Consent of Board or Committee of Board_.

 

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Board, or any committee of the
Board, may act without a meeting so long as a written consent with respect to
any action taken in lieu of a meeting (" _Consent_ ") is signed by at least as
many members of the Board or the committee thereof as would have been required
to take such action at a meeting of the Board or such committee at which all
members of the Board or such committee are present, _provided however_ , that,
for so long as ArcLight Energy Partners Fund V, L.P. or an Affiliate thereof
(" _ArcLight_ ") controls the Company and at least one (1) Board member
(other than any Independent Director) is appointed by ArcLight, including
through its right as a Class A Member under Section 7.1(a), said Consent must
include the signature of at least one (1) such ArcLight Board member.

SECTION 7.6 _Conference Telephone Meetings_.

 

Directors or members of any committee of the Board may participate in a
meeting of the Board or such committee by means of conference telephone,
videoconference or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting.

 

SECTION 7.7 _Quorum_.

A majority of all Directors (or members of a committee of the Board), present
in person or participating in accordance with _Section 7.6_, shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business of the Board (or committee thereof),
but if at any meeting of the Board (or committee thereof) there shall be less
than a quorum present, a majority of the Directors (or members of a committee
thereof) present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, all decisions of the
Board, or any committee of the Board, shall require the affirmative vote of a
majority of all Directors of the Board, or any committee of the Board,
respectively. The Directors (or members of a committee of the Board) present
at a meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business
until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Directors (or
members of such committee) to leave less than a quorum.

 



31 SECTION 7.8 _Vacancies; Increases in the Number of Directors_.

 

Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
number of Directors shall be filled by the individuals approved by the Class
A Members holding a majority of the Class A Membership Interests in their sole
discretion; _provided_ that for so long as the Class D Member has the right to
appoint the Class D Directors as provided in  _Section 7.1_, any vacancy
created by the death, resignation or removal of a Class D Director shall be
filled by an individual appointed by the Class D Member and reasonably
acceptable to the Class A Members. Each Director shall hold office until the
earlier of the next election (or, with respect to the Class D Directors,
appointment) or the death or resignation of such Director, unless sooner
removed in accordance with _Section 7.10_.

 

SECTION 7.9 _Committees_. In addition to the standing committees referenced
below, the Board may establish other committees of the Board and may delegate
any of its responsibilities to such other committees, except as prohibited by
Applicable Law.

(a) The membership and chairs of each committee shall be appointed by the
Board. The Board shall also make all determinations regarding committee
membership qualifications, provided the members of the Conflicts Committee
shall at least satisfy the qualifications thereof specified in the
Partnership Agreement.

(b) The Board shall have an Audit Committee in accordance with the rules of
the NYSE (or such other National Securities Exchange or quotation service on
which the Common Units may be listed), as amended from time to time.

(c) The Board may have a Conflicts Committee that shall function in the
manner described in the Partnership Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement, the Partnership Agreement or any Group Member Agreement or
any duty (including any fiduciary duty) otherwise existing under the Act or
any other Applicable Law or in equity, any matter approved by the Conflicts
Committee in accordance with the provisions, and subject to the limitations,
of the Partnership Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a breach of any duty
(including any fiduciary duty) owed by the Board or any Director to the
Company or the Members or any other Person bound by this Agreement.

 

(d) A majority of any committee, present in person or participating in
accordance with _Section 7.6_, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business of such committee.

(e) A majority of any committee may determine its action and fix the time and
place of its meetings unless the Board shall otherwise provide. Notice of

indemnified and held harmless by the Company from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including
legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements
or other amounts arising from any and all threatened, pending or completed
claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and including
appeals, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee
and acting (or refraining to act) in such capacity on behalf of or for the
benefit of the Company; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnitee shall not
be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to this Agreement if there has been
a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the
Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in intentional fraud, willful
misconduct (including a willful breach of this Agreement) or, in the case of a
criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitees conduct was
unlawful. Any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ shall be made
only out of the assets of the Company, it being agreed that the Members shall
not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Company to
enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified
pursuant to _Section 10.2_ in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or
proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Company prior to a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which
the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Section 10.2_,
the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Company
of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if
it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized by this _Section 10.2_.

 

(c) The indemnification provided by this _Section 10.2_ shall be in addition
to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any
agreement, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both as to actions in
the Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other
capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors,
assigns, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee.

 



42 (d) The Company may purchase and maintain (or reimburse its Affiliates for the
cost of) insurance on behalf of the Indemnitees, the Company and its
Affiliates and such other Persons as the Company shall determine, against any
liability that may be asserted against, or expense that may be incurred by,
such Person in connection with the Companys activities or such Persons
activities on behalf of the Company, regardless of whether the Company would
have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(e) For purposes of this _Section 10.2_, (i) the Company shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit
plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Company also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; (ii) excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee
with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of _Section 10.2_; and (iii) action
taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan
in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be
in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall
be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Company.

 

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Members to personal liability by
reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this _Section 10.2_ because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 10.2_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators
and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other
Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 10.2_ or any
provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of
any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company, nor
the obligations of the Company to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.2_ as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.

(j) TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SUBJECT TO

proposed to be Transferred by the Initiating Member (the " _Participation
Interest_ ") and the Sharing Percentage attributable thereto, the purchase

making such election, a " _Participating Offeree_ ") as shall equal the
product of (x) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate Sharing
Percentage attributable to the amount of Class A Membership Interest proposed
to be transferred by the Initiating Members and the denominator of which

Transferee in respect of such Membership Interests as described in the last
sentence of _Section 14.7(a)_ (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to

extent inconsistent with the following): __

(i) the twenty-five percent (25%) figure first described in  _Section

51 _ _ Interests (including by way of distributions and by way of consideration
received in exchange for Membership Interests) equal to the Class C Payout
Threshold, including with respect to the transaction in which such event
occurs, and _provided further_ that the rights and benefits of this _Section
14.7_ shall not apply for any Member with respect to any Transfer by a Class A
Member to any Affiliate of such Class A Member; __

(ii) the amount of Class C Membership Interest or Class D Membership Interest
that may be Transferred by any Class C Member or Class D Member, as
applicable, to the purchasers in a proposed transfer described in _Section
14.7(a)_ shall be that same proportion of all of such Members Membership
Interests that the aggregate Participation Interest of all Class A Members
bears to their aggregate Class A Membership Interests (but, with respect to a
Class C Member, only to the extent the Class C Members Class C Membership
Interests are then vested or would become vested in such proposed transfer,
taking into account all prior transfers of Class A Membership Interests);

 

(iii) notwithstanding anything in the last sentence of _Section 14.7(a)_, in
_Section 14.8(d)_, or otherwise herein to the contrary, the consideration to
be received by all selling Members in a sale described in _Section 14.7(a)_
or _Section 14.8_ shall be allocated among the Class A Membership Interests,
Class C Membership Interests and Class D Membership Interests being sold in
the same proportions as if the deemed value of the Company implied by the
price to be paid by the prospective Transferee for the Membership Interests
being sold were distributed without any discounts or deductions in accordance
with _Section 5.4_;

__(iv) notwithstanding anything in  _Section 14.7(a)_ or _(b)_ , or _Section
14.8_, to the contrary, with respect to any transaction described therein, (A)

any governmental or third party consents, approvals, filings or notifications
required to be obtained or made by such Member in connection with such
transaction (and then only to the extent that the other selling Members
are similarly obligated to provide similar representations, warranties and
indemnities with respect to the Membership Interests which they are selling)

_Seller Fundamental Reps_ "), and (B) no Class C Member or Class D Member
shall have joint liability with respect to any other Member; provided,

and the Class D Member shall bear a pro rata amount (based on the ratio of
the total proceeds received in such transaction by the Class C Member or the
Class D Member, as applicable, to the total proceeds received in such
transaction by all selling Members) of  __

 



52  all indemnity obligations applicable to such transaction (including all
indemnity obligations relating to representations and warranties made in
respect of or regarding the Company, the Partnership or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of such entities respective businesses or operations, but
excluding any indemnity obligations relating to any breach of a Seller
Fundamental Rep made by another Member), and provided further that the pro-

terms of any agreement for the Transfer of such Class C Membership
Interest or Class D Membership Interest, as applicable, and any other
agreement, instrument or certificates necessary to effectuate such Transfer;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, the terms and conditions agreed to by the Class
C Members or the Class D Member, as applicable, shall be substantially the

the prospective Transferee for the Sharing Percentage attributable to the
Class A Membership Interest and (B) the resulting relative value of the
Sharing Percentage

 



53  attributable to the Class D Membership Interests and (ii) with respect to a
Class C Membership Interest only if the consideration to be received in
respect of the Class C Membership Interest to be sold to the prospective
Transferee shall be determined based upon (A) the deemed value of the Company
implied by the price to be paid by the prospective Transferee for the Sharing
Percentage attributable to the Class A Membership Interest and (B) the
resulting distributions that would be made in respect of the Class C
Membership Interest under _Section 5.4_ if the Company were dissolved
pursuant to _Section 13.1_ and the distributions described in  _Section
13.2(a)(iii)(C)_ were all made on the date of such Transfer.

reasonably practical upon the terms set forth in the ROFO Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the Transferring Member receives more than one ROFO
Offer, the Transferring Member can only accept the ROFO Offer with the higher
purchase price. __

__(c) If (i) the Class A Members fail to make a ROFO Offer within
fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of a ROFO Notice or (ii) the
Transferring Member notifies the Class A Members of its refusal of a ROFO
Offer following receipt thereof or fails to timely provide written notice of
its election to accept or refuse such ROFO Offer (the date either such
condition is met, the " _ROFO Refusal Date_ "), then the Transferring Members
shall have the right to Transfer all but not less than all of the Subject
Interest to a third party that is not a Competitor or an Affiliate thereof on
terms no less favorable to the Transferring Member than those set forth in the
ROFO Offer (if a ROFO Offer has been made); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
purchase price for the Subject Interest to be paid by any such third party
shall be the price equal to or greater than (A) the consideration set forth in
the ROFO Offer multiplied by (B) 103%. __

 

 __(d) If the Transferring Member does not consummate a third-party sale
within 120 days of the ROFO Refusal Date (the " _ROFO Transfer Period_ "),
(i) the Transferring Member shall not be permitted to Transfer any portion of
the Subject Interest for a period of 180 days after the expiration of the ROFO
Transfer Period and (iii) after such 180-day period, the Subject Interest
shall again become subject to the restrictions on Transfer contained in this
_Section 14.9_ and shall not be Transferred without again complying with this
_Section 14.9_. __

 

SECTION 14.10 _Transfer and Amendment of Incentive Distribution Rights_.

 

The Company shall not transfer any Incentive Distribution Rights to the Class
A Members or their respective Affiliates (it being understood that members of
the Partnership Group shall not be considered Affiliates of the Class A
Members for purposes of this _Section 14.10_) without the prior written
consent of the Class C Members holding a majority of Class C Units, but
specifically including the Initial Class C Member, and the Class D Member
holding a majority of the then-outstanding Class D Units, which consents shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that, subject to the provisions of the Partnership Agreement, the Company
may, without the consent of the Class C Members or the Class D Member,
transfer, amend or suspend a portion of the Incentive Distribution Rights, or
the rights associated therewith whether or not for consideration, up to an
amount equal to all Incentive Distribution Rights multiplied by the aggregate
of the Class A Members Sharing Percentages, subject in each case to the
principles set forth in the following illustrative example. By way of
illustrative example, a transaction whereby the Class A Members or an
Affiliate thereof contributes an asset to the Company or a subsidiary thereof
in exchange for, among other consideration, the return to the Partnership of
or a distribution holiday in respect of Incentive Distribution Rights, would
require (a) the consent of the Class C Members holding a majority of Class C
Units, but specifically including the Initial Class C Member, except no such
consent of the Class C Members will be required if (I) such return or
distribution holiday is structured so that such return or distribution holiday
is only from the Class A Members pro rata share of the 

 



55  Incentive Distribution Rights, with such pro rata share equal to the Class A
Members then aggregate Sharing Percentages and (II) during the pendency of
such return or distribution holiday the Class C Members Sharing Percentage
is equitably adjusted upward, as necessary, to reflect the reduction in total
Incentive Distribution Rights cash flow received by the Company or such other
action is taken as necessary in order for the Class C Members to remain
economically unaffected in any material respect as a result of the
transaction, and/or (b) the consent of the Class D Member, except no such
consent of the Class D Member will be required if (I) such return or
distribution holiday is structured so that such return or distribution holiday
is only from the Class A Members pro rata share of the Incentive Distribution
Rights, with such pro rata share equal to the Class A Members then aggregate
Sharing Percentages, and (II) during the pendency of such return or
distribution holiday the Class D Members Sharing Percentage is equitably
adjusted upward to reflect the reduction in total Incentive
Distribution Rights cash flow received by the Company or such other action is
taken as necessary in order for the Class D Member to remain economically
unaffected in any material respect as a result of the transaction.

SECTION 15.3 _Entire Agreement; Superseding Effect_.

 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Members relating to the
Company and the transactions contemplated hereby, and supersedes all
provisions and concepts contained in all prior contracts or agreements of the
Members with respect to the Company, whether oral or written, including the
Existing Agreement.

 



57 SECTION 15.4 _Effect of Waiver or Consent_.

 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a waiver or consent, express
or implied, to or of any breach or default by the Board or any Member in the
performance by the Board or that Member of its respective obligations with
respect to the Company is not a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or
default in the performance by the Board or that Member of the same or any
other obligations of the Board or that Member with respect to the Company.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, failure on the part of the
Board or a Member to complain of any act of the Board or any Member or to
declare the Board or any Member in default with respect to the Company,
irrespective of how long that failure continues, does not constitute a waiver
by the Board or that Member of its rights with respect to that default until
the applicable statute-of-limitations period has run. 

SECTION 15.5 _Amendment or Restatement_.

 

This Agreement and the Delaware Certificate may be amended or restated only by
a written instrument approved by the Class A Members. Notwithstanding any
provision of this _Section 15.5_ to the contrary, for so long as the Initial
Class C Member is a Member, the Class A Members shall not amend or restate
this Agreement (or the Delaware Certificate to the extent such amendment
would be inconsistent with this Agreement) (a) without the prior written
consent of the Initial Class C Member if such amendment would (i) increase or
extend any financial obligation or liability of the Initial Class C
Member, (ii) materially and adversely affect the rights and privileges of the
Initial Class C Member in relation to the Class A Members, (iii) reduce the
Sharing Percentage of the Initial Class C Member, (iv) amend the definition
of Class C Payout or Class C Payout Threshold, or _Section 5.5_ or the
definitions therein, or (v) amend this sentence, in a manner that is
materially adverse to the Initial Class C Member and (b) without the prior
written consent of the Class D Member if such amendment would (i) increase or
extend any financial obligation or liability of the Class D Member, (ii)
materially and adversely affect the rights and privileges of the Class D
Member in relation to the Class A Members, (iii) other than in accordance
with this Agreement, including _Section 3.1(f)_, _Section 3.1(g)_ and
_Section 3.1(h)_, reduce the Sharing Percentage of the Class D Member, (iv)
amend  _Section 3.1(f)_, _Section 3.1(g)_ or _Section 3.1(h)_, or (v)
amend this sentence, in a manner that is materially adverse to the Class D
Member.

 

SECTION 15.6 _Binding Effect_.

 

Subject to the restrictions on Transfers set forth in this Agreement, this
Agreement is binding on and shall inure to the benefit of the Members and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

SECTION 15.7 _Governing Law; Severability_.

 

THIS AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT-OF-LAWS RULE OR
PRINCIPLE THAT MIGHT REFER THE GOVERNANCE OR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE LAW

 



58  OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. In the event of a direct conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and any mandatory, non-waivable provision of the
Act, such provision of the Act shall control. If any provision of the Act may
be varied or superseded in a limited liability company agreement (or otherwise
by agreement of the members or managers of a limited liability company), such
provision shall be deemed superseded and waived in its entirety if this
Agreement contains a provision addressing the same issue or subject matter. If
any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Member or
circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable to any extent, (a)
the remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to
other Members or circumstances is not affected thereby, and (b) the Members
shall negotiate in good faith to replace that provision with a new provision
that is valid and enforceable and that puts the Members in substantially the
same economic, business and legal position as they would have been in if the
original provision had been valid and enforceable.

 

SECTION 15.8 _Further Assurances_.

 

In connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
each Member shall execute and deliver any additional documents
and instruments and perform any additional acts that may be necessary or
appropriate to effectuate and perform the provisions of this Agreement and
those transactions.

 

SECTION 15.9 _Waiver of Certain Rights_.

 

Each Member, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, irrevocably
waives any right it may have to maintain any action for dissolution of the
Company or for partition of the property of the Company.

SECTION 15.10 _Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same
effect as if all signing parties had signed the same document.
All counterparts shall be construed together and constitute the same
instrument. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the use of
facsimile signatures and signatures delivered by email in portable document
format affixed in the name and on behalf of a party is expressly permitted by
this Agreement.

SECTION 15.11 _Jurisdiction_.

 

Any and all claims, suits, actions or proceedings arising out of, in
connection with or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent the Court of
Chancery lacks jurisdiction, any other state or federal court in the State of
Delaware) or in any court of competent jurisdiction in Harris County in the
State of Texas. Each party hereto unconditionally and irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of any such court over any claim, suit, action, or proceeding
and, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives any objection
that such party may have to the laying of venue of any claim, suit, action or
proceeding in any such court.

 



59 SECTION 15.12 _Confidentiality_.

 

 __The Members agree that all non-public information related to the business,
financial condition or prospects of the Company, the Partnership and their
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, including any information related to a
prospective investment, debt incurrence or equity issuance by the Company, the
Partnership or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be
considered confidential, shall be kept confidential and shall not be
disclosed by a Member to any Person that is not a Member until the date that
is two years after the disclosure of such confidential information by the
Company or the Partnership to such Member, except such information may be
disclosed by such Member: (i) to an Affiliate of such Member; (ii) to the
extent such information is required to be furnished in compliance with
Applicable Law, or pursuant to any legal proceedings or because of any order
of any Governmental Authority binding upon such Member; (iii) to
representatives, agents and counsels employed or engaged by such Member where
disclosure of such information is essential to such representatives, agents
or counsels work for such Member; (iv) to a bona fide prospective transferee
of such Members Membership Interest to the extent appropriate in order to
allow the assessment of such Membership Interest (including a Person with
whom a Member and/or its Affiliates are conducting bona fide negotiations
directed toward a merger, consolidation or the sale of majority ownership of
the Member or an Affiliate); (v) to a bona fide prospective investor in such
Member to the extent appropriate in order to allow the assessment of such
investment opportunity; and (vi) to the extent such information: (a) through
no fault of such Member, is, was or becomes a part of the public domain; (b)
is, was or becomes available to such Member on a non-confidential basis from
a source other than the Company or the Partnership, which source represents
that it had the right to disseminate such information at the time it was
acquired by such party; or (c) is third party non-public information that is,
was or becomes available to such party from a source other than the Company or
the Partnership; _provided, however_ , that, with respect to clauses (i),
(iii), (iv) and (v) above, prior to such disclosure, the disclosing Member
has obtained a written undertaking from the recipient to keep the information
strictly confidential until the date that is two years after the disclosure of
such confidential information by the Company or the Partnership to such
Member (unless the recipient is subject to legal obligations of
confidentiality providing protections similar to those set forth above). The
restrictions set forth in this _Section 15.12_ do not apply to
any disclosure made by a Member to an existing or bona fide prospective
investor in such Member of the terms of its investment in the Company and the
performance of that investment. __

C. The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not a party to, is not

other similar name as agreed upon by the Escrow Agent and the Transfer Agent.

E. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned
to them in the Contribution Agreement.

In consideration of the promises and agreements of the Parties and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Parties and the Escrow Agent agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

ESCROW DEPOSIT

 

Section 1.1. _Establishment of Escrow Funds_.

 

(a) Following execution of this Agreement, on the date hereof and upon the
closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, AMID
shall issue and deposit or cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent, the
General Indemnity Escrow Units, the Special Indemnity Escrow Units and the
Adjustment Escrow Units in book-entry form (collectively, and together with
any dividends, distributions, earnings or other amounts paid with respect
thereto or accrued thereon, and as reduced as a result of disbursements made
from time to time in accordance with the procedures specified in this
Agreement, the " _Escrow Property_ "). AMID shall direct the Transfer Agent
to deliver a written confirmation of the deposit of General Indemnity Escrow
Units in the General Indemnity Escrow Fund, Special Indemnity Escrow Units in
the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund and Adjustment Escrow Units in the
Adjustment Escrow Fund. AMID shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a copy of the
direction letter to the Transfer Agent. Upon the Escrow Agents receipt of
confirmation from the Transfer Agent, the Escrow Agent shall send notice to
the Parties confirming receipt of the Escrow Units from AMID and the Escrow
Property will be held and disbursed only in accordance with the express terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Contribution Agreement.

 

(b) With respect to any Escrow Units held in escrow by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Agreement, for so long as such Escrow Units are so held,
AMID shall retain all voting rights with respect to such Escrow Units and upon
disbursement of any Escrow Units to Holdings LP (the " _Holdings Disbursed
Units_ "), AMID shall no longer have voting rights with respect to
the Holdings Disbursed Units, and Holdings LP shall have the voting rights
with respect to the Holdings Disbursed Units. The Escrow Agent shall not vote
any Escrow Units or Holdings Disbursed Units, and shall not execute or deliver
any proxy to the Transfer Agent with respect to voting such units until the
Escrow Agent has received written instructions from AMID. The Escrow Agent
shall deliver any proxy materials relating to the Escrow Units to AMID upon
receipt of such proxy materials from the Transfer Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall not be responsible for delivering a vote on behalf of AMID to the
Transfer Agent in the event AMID does not provide written instructions to the
Escrow Agent.

 



2 Section 1.2. _No Investment of Escrow Property_. During the term of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Property in non-interest
bearing demand deposit accounts and the Escrow Property shall not be invested
during the term of the Escrow Agreement. Any investment of the Escrow Property
is expressly prohibited by this Agreement. Following the end of each calendar
month during which the Escrow Agent holds any Escrow Property pursuant to this
Agreement and at such other times as any Party may reasonably request, the
Escrow Agent shall provide to each of the Parties a statement detailing, for
the Escrow Funds, the total amount of the Escrow Property that remains in
escrow, all transactions involving such Escrow Property (if any) and any
disbursements made from such Escrow Funds pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, during such calendar month. This statement shall be provided
without any additional cost to any Party.

Section 1.3. _Disbursements_.

 

(a) _Disbursements from the Adjustment Escrow Fund._ With respect to the
distribution of the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Parties acknowledge that the
Adjustment Escrow Units shall be released from the Adjustment Escrow Fund
pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 2.4(d) of the Contribution
Agreement and this Section 1.3(a) as follows:

 

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is positive, then the Parties shall
promptly execute and deliver a joint instruction letter substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Joint Instruction Letter_ ") to
the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release to Holdings LP all AMID
Common Units in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(ii) of the Contribution
Agreement.

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is negative, the Parties shall promptly
execute and deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to release to AMID out of the Adjustment Escrow Fund the
number of AMID Common Units required to be released to AMID pursuant to
Section 2.4(d)(iii) of the Contribution Agreement. If the number of AMID
Common Units in the Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the entire
amount payable to AMID pursuant to Section 2.4(d)(iii) of the Contribution
Agreement, the Parties shall promptly execute and deliver the Joint
Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release
the deficiency to AMID from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If the number of AMID
Common Units in the Adjustment Escrow Fund exceeds the number required to
cover the Final Adjustment Amount, the Parties shall promptly execute and
deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to release the remaining AMID Common Units in the Adjustment Escrow Fund
to Holdings LP in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(iii) of the Contribution
Agreement.

(b) _Disbursements from the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund_. With respect to
the distribution of the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Parties acknowledge
that the Special Indemnity Escrow Units shall be released from the Special
Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Contribution
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 8.6 of the Contribution
Agreement) and this Section 1.3(b) as follows:

 



3 (i) The Parties acknowledge that if at any time AMID is entitled to receive
any amount pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Article VIII of the
Contribution Agreement with respect to Special Indemnity Damages, the Parties
shall promptly execute and deliver a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse that portion of the Special
Indemnity Escrow Units required to satisfy such obligation from the Special
Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Contribution
Agreement. If the number of Special Indemnity Escrow Units in the Special
Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the entire amount of claims for
the Special Indemnity Damages, the Parties shall promptly execute and deliver
a Joint Instruction Letter to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
disburse that portion of the General Indemnity Escrow Units to satisfy the
deficiency.

(ii) Five Business Days after Holdings LPs delivery of written evidence of a
final and enforceable resolution (whether by settlement, final non-appealable
judgment, dismissal with prejudice or otherwise) of each of the Special
Indemnity Matters to the Escrow Agent and AMID accompanied by a written
certification from counsel for Holdings LP attesting that such resolution is
final and not subject to further proceedings or appeal, the Escrow Agent shall
disburse to Holdings LP 100% of any and all Escrow Property then remaining in
the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if prior to
five Business Days after the receipt by AMID of such copy and certification,
(x) AMID shall have made a claim for indemnification for Special Indemnity
Damages in accordance with the Contribution Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 8.5 of the Contribution Agreement), (y) such claim remains
unresolved, and (z) AMID shall have delivered written notice of such
unresolved claim to the Escrow Agent and Holdings LP, the Escrow Agent shall
retain in the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund the number of Special Indemnity
Escrow Units specified in AMIDs notice (a " _Special Indemnity Retained
Amount_ "), in which case 100% of the then outstanding amount of the Escrow
Property in the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund, less any Special Indemnity
Retained Amount, shall promptly be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Holdings
LP. Upon final resolution of any unresolved claim in accordance with the
Contribution Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall thereafter release from the
Special Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Party entitled thereto all portions
of the Special Indemnity Retained Amount as and when it receives a Joint
Instruction Letter. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely
upon any such certification and instruction and shall have no responsibility
to review the resolution to which such certification and instruction refers
or to make any determination as to whether such resolution is final.

(c)  _Disbursements from the General Indemnity Escrow Fund_. With respect to
the distribution of the General Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Parties acknowledge
that the General Indemnity Escrow Units shall be released from the General
Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Contribution
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 8.6 of the Contribution
Agreement) and this Section 1.3(c) as follows:

 



4 (i) If at any time AMID is entitled to receive any amount from the

Units required to satisfy such obligation from the General Indemnity Escrow
Fund.

 

(ii) On [ ] (the " _Release Date_ "),1 the Escrow Agent shall
disburse to Holdings LP 100% of any and all Escrow Property then remaining in
the General Indemnity Escrow Fund; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if prior to
such date, (a) AMID shall have made a bona fide claim for indemnification
pursuant to and in accordance with Article VIII of the Contribution Agreement
(including but not limited to a claim for Special Indemnity Damages), (b) such
claim remains unresolved, and (c) AMID shall have, prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time on the Business Day prior to the Release Date, delivered written notice
of such unresolved claim to the Escrow Agent and Holdings, LP, the Escrow
Agent shall retain in the General Indemnity Escrow Fund the number of General
Indemnity Escrow Units specified in AMIDs notice (a " _General Indemnity
Retained Amount_ ") with respect to such unresolved claim, in which case 100%
of the then outstanding amount of the Escrow Property in the General
Indemnity Escrow Fund, less any General Indemnity Retained Amount, shall
promptly be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Holdings LP. Upon final
resolution of any unresolved claim in accordance with the Contribution
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall thereafter release from the General
Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Party entitled thereto all portions of the
General Indemnity Retained Amount as and when it receives a Joint Instruction
Letter.

 

(d) _Court Order._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Escrow
Agent shall disburse the Escrow Property, or any portion thereof, in
accordance with a certified copy of any final and nonappealable order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction directing such disbursement (a "
_Final Order_ "), accompanied by a written certification from counsel for the
instructing Party attesting that such order is final and not subject to
further proceedings or appeal along with a written instruction from the
instructing Party given to effectuate such order or judgment and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any such certification and
instruction and shall have no responsibility to review the order or judgment
to which such certification and instruction refers or to make any
determination as to whether such order or judgment is final.

(e) _Payment by the Escrow Agent_. The Parties agree that any payment that the
Escrow Agent is instructed to make from the Escrow Property pursuant to this
Escrow Agreement shall be the lesser of (i) the stated payment amount and (ii)
the balance of the Escrow Property, as applicable, and shall be disbursed as
set forth in the Joint Instruction Letter delivered by the Parties. The
release of any Escrow Units under this Section 1.3 shall include cash from any
dividends, distributions, earnings or other amounts paid or accrued thereon
with respect to such Escrow Units in accordance with the Contribution
Agreement and as set forth in the applicable Joint Instruction Letter. The
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to verify, calculate or confirm the value of
any Escrow Property. The Parties agree that any release of Escrow Units

 



   1  |

Date to be later of 12 months from the closing date and May 31, 2019.  

---|--- 
 



5  will always reflect unit amounts as whole units, not fractional units.
Within five Business Days after the Escrow Agent is required to release Escrow
Units in accordance with this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall
deliver written instructions in the form of _Exhibit E_ to the Transfer Agent
requesting Transfer Agent to disburse the Escrow Units. The Escrow Agent shall
not be responsible for Transfer Agents processing time to release the Escrow
Units by the Transfer Agent to any Party.

Section 1.4. _Security Procedure For Funds Transfers_. The Escrow Agent shall
confirm each Escrow Property transfer instruction received in the name of a
Party by means of the security procedure selected by such Party and
communicated to the Escrow Agent through a signed certificate in the form of
Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 attached hereto, which upon receipt by the Escrow
Agent shall become a part of this Agreement. Once delivered to the Escrow
Agent, Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 may be revised or rescinded only by a
writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such revisions
or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and following such
period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable
opportunity to act on it. If a revised Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 or a
rescission of an existing Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 is delivered to the
Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to such Party, such
document shall be accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to
the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and
responsibilities of the Party under this Agreement.

The Parties understand that the Escrow Agents inability to receive or
confirm Escrow Property transfer instructions pursuant to the security
procedure selected by such Party may result in a delay in accomplishing such
funds transfer, and agree that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
loss caused by any such delay.

Section 1.5. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, Holdings LP shall be
treated as owning the Escrow Property.

 

(b) For certain payments made pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may
be required to make a "reportable payment" or "withholdable payment" and in
such cases the Escrow Agent shall have the duty to act as a payor or
withholding agent, respectively, that is responsible for any tax withholding
and reporting required under Chapters 3, 4, and 61 of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Escrow Agent shall
have the sole right to make the determination as to which payments are
"reportable payments" or "withholdable payments." All parties to this
Agreement shall provide an executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8
(or, in each case, any successor form) to the Escrow Agent prior to the date
hereof, and shall promptly update any such form to the extent such
form becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect. The Escrow Agent shall
have the right to request from any Party to this Agreement, or any other
person or entity entitled to payment hereunder, any additional forms,
documentation or other information as may be reasonably necessary for the
Escrow Agent to satisfy its reporting and withholding obligations under the
Code. To the extent any such forms to be delivered under this Section 1.5(b)
are not provided prior to the date hereof or by the time the related payment
is required to be made or are

 



6  determined by the Escrow Agent to be incomplete and/or inaccurate in any
respect, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to withhold (without liability) a
portion of any income derived from the Escrow Property or on any such
payments hereunder to the extent withholding is required under Chapters 3, 4,
or 61 of the Code, and shall have no obligation to gross up any such payment.

 

(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of income derived from the Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent
shall satisfy such liability to the extent possible from the Escrow Property.
The Parties, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest,
penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed against the Escrow
Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Units unless such tax, late payment,
interest, penalty or other expense was directly caused by the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The indemnification provided by
this Section 1.5(c) is in addition to the indemnification provided in Section
3.1 and shall survive the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent and the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge that, in order to help fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
person or corporation who opens an account and/or enters into a business
relationship. The Parties hereby agree that they shall provide the Escrow
Agent with such information as the Escrow Agent may request including, but
not limited to, each Partys name, physical address, tax identification number
and other information that will assist the Escrow Agent in identifying and
verifying each Partys identity such as organizational documents,
certificates of good standing, licenses to do business, or other pertinent
identifying information.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon
receipt of Tax Distribution Instructions (as defined below) which may be
delivered on a quarterly basis, Escrow Agent shall pay to Holdings LP the Tax
Distribution Amount (as defined below) set forth in such Tax Distribution
Instructions from any cash distributions received by Escrow Agent on the
Escrow Units. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax Distribution Amount_ "
shall mean the amount necessary for Holdings LP to distribute on a quarterly
basis any required tax distributions pursuant to the Holdings LP
Organizational Documents in effect as of the date hereof related to any
income allocated to Holdings LP in connection with the Escrow Units, as
determined in the reasonable discretion of Holdings LP based on (i) the
requirements of the Holdings LP Organizational Documents in effect as of the
date hereof and (ii) AMIDs expected profit and loss allocations for the
relevant period, as determined in the reasonable discretion of AMID. Holdings
LP and AMID agree to cooperate with each other and act reasonably and in good
faith in the determination of the quarterly Tax Distribution Amount and timely
request for payment in accordance with this Agreement and the Holdings LP
Organizational Documents. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax Distribution
Instructions_ " shall mean joint written instructions from Holdings LP and
AMID to Escrow Agent setting forth, and requesting payment of, any Tax
Distribution Amount which shall be delivered to Escrow Agent no more
frequently than once each calendar quarter.

 



7 Section 1.6. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the
disbursement of all of the Escrow Property except that the provisions of
Sections 1.5(c), Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 hereof shall survive termination,
and the Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to disburse the Escrow
Property in accordance with Section 1.3.

Escrow Agent will not be responsible for determining or making inquiry into

taken or not taken by it in accordance with the direction or consent of the
Parties or their respective agents, representatives, successors, or assigns.

attorneys fees and expenses or other reasonable professional fees and
expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by reason of any action,
claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent, arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction to which this Agreement relates, unless such
loss, liability, cost, damage or expense shall have been finally adjudicated
to have been directly caused by the own fraud, willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Escrow Agent. Solely among the Parties, and without limiting
the obligations of the Parties under this Section 3.1, such indemnification
obligations, if any, shall be paid severally among AMID and Holdings LP. The
provisions of this Section 3.1 shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Limitation of Liability_. THE ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT

AGENTS OWN FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE
FORM OF ACTION.

Section 3.3. _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time
by furnishing at least 60 calendar days prior written notice of its

other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding

9  contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that the conditions for the disbursement of funds under this Agreement are not
fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this
Agreement at the direction of any Party, or any material modification hereof,
or if any material controversy arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a
party to any litigation pertaining to this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary
services and reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay, controversy,
litigation or event. The Escrow Agent shall have, and is hereby granted, the
right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and
unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow Property in the event such
fees, expenses and indemnification obligations are not paid within 45
calendar days after Escrow Agent has provided written notice to the Parties
that such fees, expenses or indemnification obligations are due.

 

Section 3.5. _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises
between, among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning
or validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to be
taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, retain the Escrow
Property until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a Final Order, (ii) receives a
Joint Instruction Letter directing delivery of the Escrow Property, in which
event the Escrow Agent shall be authorized to disburse the Escrow Property in
accordance with such final court order, arbitration decision, or Joint
Instruction Letter, or (iii) files an interpleader action in any court of
competent jurisdiction, and upon the filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be
relieved of all liability as to the Escrow Property and shall be entitled to
recover attorneys fees, expenses and other costs incurred in commencing and
maintaining any such interpleader action. Any such Final Order shall be
accompanied by a written instrument of the presenting Party certifying that
such Final Order is final, non-appealable and from a court of competent

Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely without
further investigation. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such
agreement, court order, or arbitration decision without further question,
inquiry, or consent.

which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such conversion,
sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party,
shall be and become the successor escrow agent under this Agreement and shall
have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and privileges as
its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any instrument or paper
or the performance of any further act.

Section 3.7. _Attachment of Escrow Property; Compliance with Legal Orders_.
In the event that any Escrow Property shall be attached, garnished or levied
upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined
by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made
or entered by any court order affecting the Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent
is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems
appropriate or to comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or
issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is
binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. In the event

 



10  that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree
it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, firm or
corporation, should, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding, such writ,
order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or
vacated. The Escrow Agent shall further have no obligation to pursue any
action that is not in accordance with applicable law.

Section 4.4. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State without
giving effect to the choice of law principles of such state that would require
or permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State

 



13  of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other
than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts
for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
Section 4.4, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
parties agrees that a judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other many provided by Law.

 

Section 4.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Contribution Agreement, (except for the Contribution Agreement with respect
to Holdings LP and AMID only) (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or
remedies hereunder.

 

Section 4.6. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded,
rescinded, or canceled only by a written instrument executed by the Parties
and the Escrow Agent.

Section 4.7. _Waivers_. The failure of any party to this Agreement at any time
or times to require performance of any provision under this Agreement shall
in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same performance.
A waiver by any party to this Agreement of any such condition or breach of any
term, covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement, in
any one or more instances, shall neither be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or breach nor a waiver of any other
condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation, or warranty

S-1 _EXHIBIT A_

 

[RESERVED] _EXHIBIT B-1_

 

American Midstream Partners, LP (" _AMID_ ") certifies that the names, titles,
telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and specimen signatures set forth in
Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1 identify the persons authorized to provide
direction and initiate or confirm transactions, including funds transfer
instructions, on behalf of AMID, and that the option checked in Part III of
this Exhibit B-1 is the security procedure selected by AMID for use in
verifying that a funds transfer instruction received by the Escrow Agent is
that of AMID.

AMID has reviewed each of the security procedures and has determined that the
option checked in Part III of this Exhibit B-1 best meets its requirements;
given the size, type and frequency of the instructions it will issue to the
Escrow Agent. By selecting the security procedure specified in Part III of
this Exhibit B-1, AMID acknowledges that it has elected to not use the other
security procedures described and agrees to be bound by any funds transfer
instruction, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by
the Escrow Agent in compliance with the particular security procedure chosen
by AMID.

_NOTICE_ : The security procedure selected by AMID will not be used to detect
errors in the funds transfer instructions given by AMID. If a funds transfer
instruction describes the beneficiary of the payment inconsistently by name
and account number, payment may be made on the basis of the account number
even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. If a
funds transfer instruction describes a participating financial institution
inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number
may be relied upon as the proper identification of the financial institution.
Therefore, it is important that AMID take such steps as it deems prudent to
ensure that there are no such inconsistencies in the funds transfer
instructions it sends to the Escrow Agent.

 Part III

 

 _Means for delivery of instructions and/or confirmations_

 

The security procedure to be used with respect to funds transfer instructions
is checked below:

 

 _ _Option 1. Confirmation by telephone call-back__. The Escrow Agent shall
confirm funds transfer instructions by telephone call-back to a person at the
telephone number designated on Part II above. The person confirming the funds
transfer instruction shall be a person other than the person from whom the
funds transfer instruction was received, unless only one person is
designated in both Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1.

CHECK box, if applicable:

 

If the Escrow Agent is unable to obtain confirmation by telephone call-back,
the Escrow Agent may, at its discretion, confirm by e-mail, as described in
Option 2.

__Option 2. Confirmation by e-mail__. The Escrow Agent shall confirm funds
transfer instructions by e-mail to a person at the e-mail address specified
for such person in Part II of this Exhibit B-1. The person confirming the
funds transfer instruction shall be a person other than the person from whom
the funds transfer instruction was received, unless only one person is
designated in both Parts I and II of this Exhibit B-1. AMID understands the
risks associated with communicating sensitive matters, including time
sensitive matters, by e-mail. AMID further acknowledges that instructions
and data sent by e-mail may be less confidential or secure than instructions
or data transmitted by other methods. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any loss of the confidentiality of instructions and data prior to receipt by
the Escrow Agent. 

CHECK box, if applicable:

 

If the Escrow Agent is unable to obtain confirmation by e-mail, the Escrow
Agent may, at its discretion, confirm by telephone call-back, as described in
Option 1.

* _ _Option 3. Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password protected file transfer system only no confirmation__. The Escrow Agent offers the option to deliver funds transfer instructions through a password protected file transfer system. If AMID wishes to use the password protected file transfer system, further instructions will be provided by the Escrow Agent. If AMID chooses this Option 3, it agrees that no further confirmation of funds transfer instructions will be performed by the Escrow Agent. 

 

* _ _Option 4. Delivery of funds transfer instructions by password protected file transfer system with confirmation__. Same as Option 3 above, but the Escrow Agent shall confirm funds transfer instructions by telephone call-back or e-mail (must check at least one, may check both) to a person at the telephone number or e-mail address designated on Part II above. By checking a box in the prior sentence, the party shall be deemed to have agreed to the terms of such confirmation option as more fully described in Option 1 and Option 2 above. 



    _*_  | _The password protected file system has a password that
expires every 60 days. If you anticipate having infrequent activity on this
account,_ _please consult with your Escrow Agent before selecting
this option_ _._

_Important information about identifying our customers _

_To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, and record information that identifies each person (individual,
corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other entity recognized as a legal
person) for whom we open an account._

 

 _What this means for you: Before we open an account, we will ask for your
name, address, date of birth (for individuals), TIN/EIN or other information
that will allow us to identify you or your company. For individuals, this
could mean identifying documents such as a driver s license. For a
corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other entity recognized as a legal
person, this could mean identifying documents such as a Certificate of
Formation from the issuing state agency. _ _EXHIBIT D_

announce the intention to do any of the foregoing, or (ii) enter into any swap
or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Tranche
B Lock-Up Securities, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by
delivery of AMID Common Units, AMID Preferred Units, the Option, the Option
Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the final release of any
Special Indemnity Escrow Units out of the Special Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Contribution Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, but in each case subject to compliance with applicable law
(including securities laws) and the terms and conditions of the limited
partnership agreement of the Partnership as then in effect, the undersigned
may transfer the Lock-Up Securities to holders of Class A-I Units (as defined
in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the
undersigned, dated as of April 13, 2016 (the "Holdings LPA")) or Class A-II
Units (as defined in the Holdings LPA) without the prior written consent of
the Partnership, provided that the transferee thereof agrees in writing to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this letter agreement by executing and
delivering to the Partnership a joinder substantially in the form attached
hereto as Annex A.

This letter agreement shall automatically terminate upon a "change of
control" of the General Partner or the Partnership. For purposes of this
letter agreement, "change of control" shall mean the consummation of any
transaction (including, without limitation, any merger, consolidation or
business combination), the result of which is that any person (excluding the
undersigned), other than the owners of the General Partner immediately
following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement, becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than
fifty percent (50%) of the equity of the General Partner or of the
Partnership, in each case measured by voting power rather than number of
units.

The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer
instructions with the Partnerships transfer agent and registrar against the
transfer of the Tranche A Lock-Up Securities and Tranche B Lock-Up Securities
during the Tranche A Lock-Up Period or Tranche B Lock-Up Period, respectively,
except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

This letter agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or
related to this letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflict of laws principles thereof.       |  |

ARTICLE II

 

THE OPTION

2.1  _Option_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AMID
hereby grants to the Holder the right and option to cause AMID to issue the
Option Units to the Holder at a price per unit equal to the Exercise Price
(the " _Option_ "), and the Holder may exercise the Option in accordance with
this Agreement. If the Option is exercised, AMID shall issue to the Holder the
Option Units to be delivered upon such exercise of the Option pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.2 _Option Exercise_. The Option may be exercised at any time or from time to
time on or after the Transaction Closing Date until the Expiration Time as to
the entire number or any lesser number of the Option Units the Holder elects
to exercise. If the Option is not fully exercised by the Expiration Time, the
Option and this Agreement will automatically terminate without any action by
any Party. The Option may be exercised by the Holder as follows:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.2_, the Holder may
exercise the Option, in whole or in part, without the payment of cash by the
Holder (the " _Cashless Exercise_ ") as provided for in this _Section 2.2_.
Upon the Cashless Exercise, AMID shall promptly issue to the Holder (without
payment by the Holder of any of the Exercise Price) that number of AMID Common
Units equal to (i) (A) the number of AMID Common Units with respect to which
the Holder is exercising purchase rights, _multiplied by_ (B) (x) the 
20-Day VWAP _minus_ (y) the Exercise Price, _divided by_ (ii) the 20-Day VWAP,
provided that any fractional units to be issued will be rounded up or down to
the nearest whole AMID Common Unit. An example calculation of the
implementation of the provisions of this _Section 2.2(a)_ is set forth in
_Exhibit B_.

 

(b) In order to exercise the Cashless Exercise, the Holder shall deliver a
written notice (the " _Cashless Exercise Notice_ ") of its intent to exercise
the Option by exercising the Cashless Exercise. The delivery of the Cashless
Exercise Notice shall be deemed a waiver of the Holders obligation to pay in
cash all or any portion of the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the
Option Units as to which such Cashless Exercise is being exercised. The Option
(or so much thereof as shall have been surrendered for conversion or deemed to
have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.2_)) will be deemed to have
been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the day of
delivery of the Cashless Exercise Notice.

(c) Within 15 days of receipt of the Cashless Exercise Notice (the "
_Issuance Date_ "), AMID shall deliver to the Holder the Option Units to be
delivered upon such exercise of the Option (which shall be in non-certificated
book-entry form).

 



2 2.3 _Lock-Up Agreement_. The Holder acknowledges that this Option and the
Option Units are "Tranche B Lock-Up Securities" as such term is defined in
the Lock-Up Letter entered into by the Holder and AMID on the Transaction
Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Letter_ "), and therefore this Option and any
Option Units shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in the Lock-Up
Letter.

ARTICLE III

Issuance Date as follows:

generally and subject, as to enforceability, to legal principles of
general applicability governing the availability of equitable remedies,
including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) (collectively, " _Creditors  Rights_").

3.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by AMID of
this Agreement, and the consummation by AMID of the transactions contemplated
hereby, does not and will not: result in any breach of any provision of the
Organizational Documents of AMID; constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a default) under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
(with or without the giving of notice, or the passage of time or both) under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which AMID is a
party or by which any property or asset of AMID is bound or affected; or
violate any Law to which AMID is subject or by which AMIDs properties or
assets are bound, except, in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) for such
defaults or rights of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration or
violations as would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
materially impair AMIDs ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



3 3.4 _Option Units_. When issued in accordance with this Agreement, the Option
Units will be duly authorized in accordance with the Organizational Documents
of AMID and will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE HOLDER

 

The Holder hereby represents and warrants to AMID as of the Execution Date and
each Issuance Date as follows:

 

4.1 _Organization; Qualification_. The Holder is an entity duly formed,

(a) The Holder has the power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery by the Holder of this Agreement and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by such Holder, and no other proceedings on the part of the
Holder are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Holder and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Party,
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Holder, enforceable against
the Holder in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by Creditors Rights.

4.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Holder
of this Agreement, and the consummation by the Holder of the transactions
contemplated hereby, does not and will not: result in any breach of any
provision of the Organizational Documents of the Holder; constitute a default
(or an event that with notice or passage of time or both would give rise to a
default) under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration (with or without the giving of notice, or the
passage of time or both) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Contract to which the Holder is a party or by which any property or asset

subject or by which the Holders properties or assets are bound, except, in
the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such defaults or rights of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration or violations as would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to materially impair the
Holders ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



4 4.4 _Investment Representation_. The Holder is an Accredited Investor. The
Holder is acquiring the Option Units for investment for its own account with
the present intention of holding the Option Units for investment purposes and
not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution. The
Holder acknowledges that it can bear the economic risk of its investment in
the Option Units indefinitely, and has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in the Option Units. The Holder acknowledges that the
Option Units will not have been registered pursuant to the Securities Act or
any applicable state securities Laws, that the Option Units will be
characterized as "restricted securities" under federal securities Laws, and
that under such Laws and applicable regulations, the Option Units cannot be
sold or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or

ARTICLE V

 

ADJUSTMENTS

5.1 _Number of Units; Exercise Price_. The number of Option Units for which
the Option is exercisable and the Exercise Price shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time following the Transaction Closing Date as set
forth in this _Article V_. 

5.2 _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by AMID_.
If at any time following the Transaction Closing Date AMID (i) makes a
distribution on the AMID Common Units in AMID Common Units, (ii) subdivides or
splits the outstanding AMID Common Units into a greater number of AMID Common
Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies the AMID Common Units into a smaller
number of AMID Common Units or (iv) issues by reclassification of the AMID
Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any reclassification in
connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which AMID
is the surviving Person), then (x) the number of Option Units for which the
Option is exercisable at the time of the record date for such distribution or
the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination, or
reclassification (the " _Pre-Adjustment Option Units_ ") shall be
proportionately adjusted so that the exercise of the Option (or, if a portion
of the Option has been exercised prior to such record date or effective date,
the portion thereof that has not been exercised) after such time shall
entitle the Holder to receive the aggregate number of AMID Common Units (or
any Partnership Interests into which such AMID Common Units would have been
combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified pursuant to clauses (iii) and
(iv) above) that the Holder would have been entitled to receive if the Option
(or portion thereof) had been exercised immediately prior to such record date
or effective date, as the case may be (the " _Post-Adjustment Option Units_
"), (y) the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to equal (1) the product of the
Exercise Price and the number of Pre-Adjustment Option Units divided by (2)
the number of Post-Adjustment Option Units, (z) and in the case of a merger,
consolidation or business combination in which AMID is the surviving Person,
AMID shall provide effective provisions to ensure that the provisions in this
_Section 5.2_ shall not be abridged or amended and that the Option Units
shall thereafter retain the same powers, preferences and relative
participating, optional and other special rights, and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereon, that the Option Units had immediately
prior to such transaction or event. An adjustment made pursuant to this
_Section 5.2_ shall become effective immediately after the record date in the
case of a distribution and shall become effective immediately after
the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination,
reclassification (including any reclassification in connection with a merger,
consolidation or business combination in which AMID is the surviving Person)
or split. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event
described above shall occur.

 



5 5.3 _Follow-On Adjustments_. Except in connection with the exercise of a
Warrant (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), if AMID shall issue or
sell, or grant any AMID Common Units or Convertible Securities at an
indicative per AMID Common Unit price (the " _Follow-On Price_ ," and such
AMID Common Units or Convertible Securities so issued, sold or granted, on an
as-converted basis, the " _Follow-On Units_ ") that is less than the Fair
Market Value, then the Exercise Price will be reset to equal the result
achieved through application of the following formula; provided that in no
event shall the Exercise Price be increased pursuant to this _Section 5.3_:

((CP x OB) + (FP x Q)) / OA

Where:

CP = the Exercise Price in effect immediately before the issuance of the
Follow-On Units

FP = the Follow-On Price

 

OB = the total number of fully diluted AMID Common Units outstanding before
the issuance of the Follow-On Units

 

Q = the total number of fully diluted Follow-On Units issued

 

OA = the total number of fully diluted AMID Common Units outstanding after
giving effect to the issuance of the Follow-On Units.

 

For purposes of this _Section 5.3_, the indicative price per AMID Common Unit
resulting from the issuance of Convertible Securities will be determined
using the principles set forth in _Section 5.5(c)_.

5.4 _When Adjustment Not Required_. Notwithstanding any of the other
provisions of this _Article V_ , no adjustment shall be made to the number of
Option Units for which the Option is exercisable or the Exercise Price
pursuant to this _Article V_ as a result of any of the following:

 

(a) the grant of AMID Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase
AMID Common Units or the issuance of AMID Common Units upon the exercise of
any such options, warrants or rights to employees, officers or directors of
the General Partner or AMID and its Subsidiaries in respect of services
provided to or for the benefit of AMID or its Subsidiaries, under compensation
plans and agreements approved in good faith by the General Partner (including
any Long Term Incentive Plan); provided that, in the case of options, warrants
or rights to purchase AMID Common Units, the exercise price per AMID Common
Unit shall not be less than the Closing Price (as defined in the Partnership
Agreement) on the date such option, warrant or other right is issued;

(b) the issuance of any AMID Common Units as all or part of the consideration
to effect (i) the closing of any acquisition by AMID of assets of an unrelated
third party in an arms-length transaction or (ii) the consummation of a
merger, consolidation or other business combination of AMID with or into
another entity to the extent such transaction(s) is or are validly approved by
the vote or consent of the General Partner; and

 



6 (c) the issuance of Partnership Interests for which an adjustment is made
under another provision of this _Article V_.

5.5 _Adjustment Rules_. The following rules shall apply for purposes of this
_Article V_ :

 

(a) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of AMID
Common Units for cash, the consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of
cash paid therefor before deducting any reasonable underwriting discounts or
placement agent fees, commissions or the expenses allowed, paid or incurred by
AMID for any underwriting or placement agent or otherwise in connection with
the issuance and sale thereof.

(b) In the case of the issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) of AMID
Common Units for consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be valued at the Agreed Value (as defined
in the Partnership Agreement) thereof;

 

(c) In the case of the issuance or sale of Convertible Securities, the
following provisions shall apply for all purposes of this  _Section 5.5_:

(i) The aggregate maximum number of AMID Common Units deliverable upon
exercise (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
including, without limitation, the passage of time, but without taking into
account potential antidilution adjustments) of options or warrants to purchase
or rights to subscribe for AMID Common Units shall be deemed to have been
issued at the time such options, warrants or rights were issued and for
consideration equal to the consideration (determined in the manner provided in
this _Section 5.5_), if any, received by AMID upon the issuance of
such options, warrants or rights plus the minimum exercise price provided in
such options, warrants or rights (without taking into account potential
antidilution adjustments) for the AMID Common Units covered thereby.

 

(ii) The aggregate maximum number of AMID Common Units deliverable upon
conversion of or in exchange (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to
convertibility or exchangeability, including, without limitation, the passage
of time, but without taking into account potential antidilution adjustments)
for any such convertible or exchangeable securities or upon the exercise
of options or warrants to purchase or rights to subscribe for such
convertible or exchangeable securities and subsequent conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued at the time such securities were
issued or such options, warrants or rights were issued and for a
consideration equal to the consideration, if any, received by AMID for any
such securities or options, warrants or rights, plus the minimum additional
consideration, if any, to be received by AMID (without taking into account
potential antidilution adjustments) upon the conversion or exchange of such
securities or upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights and
subsequent conversion or exchange of the underlying convertible or
exchangeable securities, as appropriate (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the manner provided in this _Section 5.5_).

 



7 (iii) In the event of any change in (x) the number of AMID Common Units
deliverable or (y) the consideration payable to AMID upon exercise of such
options, warrants or rights with respect to either AMID Common Units or such
convertible or exchangeable securities or upon conversion of or in exchange
for such convertible or exchangeable securities and not otherwise entitled to
any appropriate antidilution adjustment pursuant to this _Article V_ ,
including, but not limited to, a change resulting from the antidilution
provisions thereof, the number of Option Units for which the Option is
exercisable or the Exercise Price, to the extent in any way affected by or
computed using such options, warrants, rights or securities, shall be
recomputed to reflect such change, but no further adjustment shall be made
for the actual issuance of AMID Common Units or any payment of such
consideration upon the exercise of any such options, warrants or rights or the
conversion or exchange of such securities.

 

(iv) Upon the expiration of any such options, warrants or rights with respect
to either AMID Common Units or such convertible or exchangeable securities or
the termination of any such rights to convert or exchange, the number of
Option Units for which the Option is exercisable or the Exercise Price, to the
extent in any way affected by or computed using such options, warrants, rights
or securities shall be recomputed to reflect the issuance of only the number
of AMID Common Units actually issued upon the exercise of such options,
warrants or rights with respect to AMID Common Units, upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities, or the number of AMID Common Units issuable upon
conversion or exchange of the convertible or exchangeable securities that were
actually issued upon exercise of options, warrants or rights related to such
securities.

 

(v) The number of AMID Common Units deemed issued and the consideration deemed
paid therefor pursuant to _Section 5.5(c)(i)_ and  _(ii)_ shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect any change, termination or expiration of the
type described in either _Section 5.5(c)(iii)_ and _(iv)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this _Section 5.5_, no
adjustment shall be made to the number of Option Units for which the Option
is exercisable or the Exercise Price as a result of an event for which an
adjustment is made under another provision of this _Section 5.5_.

 

(e) For purposes of this _Article V_ , no adjustment to the number of Option
Units for which the Option is exercisable shall be made in an amount less
than 1/100th of an AMID Common Unit and no adjustment to the Exercise Price
shall be made in an amount less than 1/100th of one cent per AMID Common Unit;
provided that any adjustments that are not required to be made by reason of
this sentence shall be carried forward and shall be taken into account in any
subsequent adjustment made.

 

5.6 _AMID Undertaking_. AMID agrees that it will act in good faith to make any
adjustment(s) required by this _Article V_ equitably and in such a manner as
to afford the Holder the benefits of the provisions hereof, and will not take
any action that could reasonably be expected to deprive the Holder of the
benefit hereof.

Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but in each case subject to compliance with applicable Law (including
securities law), the terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement, as it
may be amended from time to time, and any transfer restrictions on this
Agreement and AMID Common Units otherwise held by Holder (including the Lock-
Up Letter), Holder may assign in writing all but not less than all of its
rights under this Agreement to any Person who would otherwise be a permitted

right under any provision of this Agreement or shall by reasons of any such
provision make any claim in respect of any liability (or otherwise) against
any other Party.

 

7.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and

among the Parties or between any of them with respect to such subject matter.

 

7.9 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such provision or portion of any provision shall be severable
and the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement
will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had
never been contained herein.

7.10  _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party agrees that it has been
represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that it
has executed the same upon the advice of such independent counsel. Each Party
and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be construed
against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the Parties waive
the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

purposes hereof, without delivery of an original signature being thereafter
required. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
