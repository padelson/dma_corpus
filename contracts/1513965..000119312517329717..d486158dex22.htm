OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.</B> In the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any mandatory, non-waivable provision of the Act, such provision of the Act shall
control. If any provision of the Act may be varied or superseded in a limited liability company agreement (or otherwise by agreement of the members or managers of a limited liability company), such provision shall be deemed superseded and waived in
its entirety if this Agreement contains a provision addressing the same issue or subject matter. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Member or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable to any extent, (a)&nbsp;the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Members or circumstances is not affected thereby, and (b)&nbsp;the Members shall negotiate in good faith to replace that provision with a new provision that is valid and
enforceable and that puts the Members in substantially the same economic, business and legal position as they would have been in if the original provision had been valid and enforceable.<B> </B></P>
