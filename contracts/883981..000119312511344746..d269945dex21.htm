_THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_

Section 2.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to use commercially reasonable efforts to commence
within five (5) Business Days from the date hereof (and in any event Purchaser
shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, commence within ten (10) Business
Days from the date hereof), the Offer within the meaning of the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of
Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject
to (i) there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
of the Offer that number of shares of the Company Common Stock that, together
with shares of the Company Common Stock already owned by Parent and Purchaser
or their respective Affiliates, which shall include, for the avoidance of
doubt, Tilman J. Fertitta, would represent at least a majority of the Fully
Diluted Shares (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ") and (ii) the satisfaction,
or waiver by Parent or Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements
set forth in _Exhibit C_ as such conditions may be modified in accordance with
the express terms of this Agreement. The initial expiration date of the Offer
shall be midnight (New York City time) on the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the
Exchange Act). Purchaser expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion
to waive, in whole or in part, any condition to the Offer or modify the terms
of the Offer, except that, without the written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of the Company Common
Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive or amend
the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit
C_ or modify any condition set forth in _Exhibit C_ in any manner adverse to
the Company or the holders of the Company Common Stock, (v) except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 2.1(a)_, extend the Offer or change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend the Offer
in any manner adverse to the Company or the holders of the Company Common
Stock. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith to modify the terms
of the Offer as and if required by the SEC. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for the
minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to
cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In addition,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, if at
the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer (i) any condition to
the Offer is not satisfied, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, extend the Offer for one (1) or more consecutive increments of not more
than ten (10) Business Days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed
to by the Company) and (ii) if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time
of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Exhibit C_ ,
Purchaser may, and Parent may cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer to a date
that is not more than (2) two Business Days after the end of the Marketing
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to, and
Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer beyond
the Outside Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept
and pay for (subject to any

 



-11-   withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_) all shares of the Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer promptly
after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended and re-extended in
accordance with this _Section 2.1(a)_). Nothing contained in this _Section
2.1(a)_ shall affect any termination rights in _Article VIII_.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall
file with the SEC, pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and
the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_
"). Parent and Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of the Company Common Stock
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the Company
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or
reasonably requested by Parent and Purchaser for inclusion therein. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and to correct any material omissions therein; and each of
Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so amended
or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws.
Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel copies of any
written comments, and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any
oral comments or discussions, that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from or engage in with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or the commencement or
occurrence of any such discussions. Prior to the filing of the Offer
Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Purchaser
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final
version thereof), and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by the Company or its counsel.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of the Company Common Stock
that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

(d) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration
thereof without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII. In the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII prior to any scheduled
expiration thereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated
prior to the purchase of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Offer,
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered shares of the Company Common Stock
to the registered holders thereof.

 



-12-  (e) _Board Representation_. Subject to applicable Law and to the extent
permitted by the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, if after the
Acceptance Time the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders
is required by Law (including if the conditions to the Top-Up Option are not
satisfied or the Top-Up Option is for any reason deemed to be invalid or
unenforceable), Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the Company Board
as will give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the
product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to the election or appointment of any additional directors pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(e)_) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and/or Purchaser (including all Shares which have
been accepted for payment pursuant to _Article III_ ) bears to the number of
Shares outstanding, and upon the request of Parent, the Company
shall promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use its reasonable
best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is
necessary to provide Parent with such level of representation (the date on
which the majority of the Companys directors are designees of Parent that
have been effectively elected or appointed to the Company Board in accordance
herewith, the " _Board Appointment Date_ "). Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals designated
by Parent to constitute the same percentage as is on the entire Company Board
(after giving effect to this _Section 2.1(e)_) to be on (i) each committee of
the Company Board of the Company and (ii) each board of directors and each
committee thereof of each Company Subsidiary. The Companys obligations to
elect or appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. At the request of Parent, the Company
shall promptly take, at its expense, all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act in order to fulfill its
obligations under this  _Section 2.1(e)_ and shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 or otherwise timely mail to its stockholders all necessary information
to comply therewith. Parent will supply to the Company, and be solely
responsible for, all information with respect to itself and its officers,
directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the
Exchange Act. In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to
the Company Board pursuant to this  _Section 2.1(e)_, then, until the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least
three directors who are members of the Company Board on the date of this
Agreement and who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act and applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the "
_Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the number of
Independent Directors is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining
Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate an individual or
individuals to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors
then remain, the other directors shall promptly (and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days) designate three individuals to fill such vacancies who are
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and applicable
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, and such individuals shall be
deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_
, that if no such Independent Director is appointed in such time period,
Parent shall designate such Independent Director(s). Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the Board Appointment Date
and prior to the

 



-13-   Effective Time, subject to the terms hereof, any amendment or termination of
this Agreement by the Company requiring action by the Company Board, any
extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser or waiver of any of the
Companys rights hereunder, will, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
require the concurrence of a majority of the Independent Directors (or in the
case where there are two or fewer Independent Directors, the concurrence of
one Independent Director).

 

Section 2.2. _Company Actions_.

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents
and warrants that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the Top-Up Option,
are advisable, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and the
Top-Up Option, (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares and, if required by
applicable Law, adopt and approve this Agreement, provided that such
recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended only in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 6.2_, (iv) resolved to elect, to the extent
permitted by Law, not to be subject to any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-
takeover Laws of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to this
Agreement, and (v) taken all necessary steps to render the restrictions of
Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger, Parent, Purchaser, and the
acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company
Board described in the first sentence of this _Section 2.2(a)_, subject to
the Companys rights to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation only in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.2._ The Company hereby
represents and warrants that, as of the date hereof, it has been advised that
each of its directors and named executive officers of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries intends to tender pursuant to the Offer any and all Shares
they own beneficially or of record.

(b) The Company shall file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the
filing by Parent of the Offer Documents (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter), a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to
time, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") describing, subject to _Section 6.2_, the
recommendations referred to in _Section 4.3(b)_, and shall mail the Schedule
14D-9 to the holders of the Company Common Stock. Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Purchaser required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9
or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion therein. Each of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and to correct
any material omissions therein. The Company shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel copies of any written comments and shall inform Parent and its 

 



-14-   counsel of any oral comments or discussions that the Company or its counsel
may receive from or engage in with the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments or the
commencement or occurrence of any such discussions. Prior to the filing of the
Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or
the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company
shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed final
version thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent or its counsel. Subject to
_Section 6.2_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the Company Board contained in the
Schedule 14D-9.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to furnish Purchaser promptly with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Company Common Stock as of a recent
date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date,
together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys possession
or control regarding the beneficial owners of the Company Common Stock, and
shall furnish to Purchaser such information and assistance (including updated
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as
Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Companys
stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser shall
hold in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request of the Company, return to
the Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their
possession or control.

Section 2.3. _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to _Sections 2.3(b)_ and _2.3(c)_ , the Company grants to
Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, to
purchase from the Company that number of shares of the Company Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or
their respective Affiliates at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes at least one share of the Company Common Stock more than ninety
percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of all shares of the Company Common Stock to be
issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option (such shares of the Company Common
Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_
").

(b) Subject to satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature must be satisfied on
the Closing Date), if there shall not have been validly tendered in the Offer
and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock
which, when added to the shares of Company Common

 



-15-   Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or their respective Affiliates, would
represent at least 90% of the shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding
(treating shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as not outstanding)
at the Acceptance Time (the " _Short-Form Threshold_ "), then Purchaser shall
exercise the Top-Up for such number of Top-Up Shares as is necessary for
Purchaser to reach the Short-Form Threshold;  _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable (i) if any Law or Judgment then in effect shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Shares and (ii) unless Parent or Purchaser has accepted for payment all shares
of the Company Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn.
The closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares shall take place at the
location of the Closing specified in Section 2.5, and shall take place
simultaneously with, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the
Acceptance Time. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier to occur
of (x) the Effective Time and (y) valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_. The aggregate purchase price payable for the
Top-Up Shares being purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall
be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer
Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Purchaser, at its
election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in cash an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares and by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any such promissory note
shall be fully secured by the Top-Up Shares (to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law), shall be full recourse against Parent and Purchaser, shall
bear interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per annum, shall mature on the
first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Without
the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up
Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only once and shall
not be assigned by Purchaser other than to Parent or a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of Law or otherwise, without the
prior written consent of the Company. Any attempted assignment in violation of
this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be null and void. The Company Board has
determined that such consideration for the Top-Up Shares is adequate in
accordance with the DGCL and otherwise taken all steps necessary such that
upon issuance and delivery in accordance with this  _Section 2.3(b)_ the
Top-Up Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassesable.

(c) In the event that Purchaser shall exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall deliver to the Company written notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting
forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Purchaser intends to purchase
pursuant to the Top-Up Option, and (ii) the manner in which Purchaser intends
to pay the applicable purchase price. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Purchaser that, promptly following such
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser shall consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to
Purchaser specifying, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its
notice, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, Parent and Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser the Top-Up
Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that
the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.4_, and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as
possible. The parties hereto further agree to

 



-16-   use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, subject to applicable Law, as close
in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day
as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares. Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall
cooperate to ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished in
a manner consistent with all applicable Laws. 

(d) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of
Parent and Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that Purchaser is,
and will be upon any exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor"
as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
Each of Parent and Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up
Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Purchaser for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with
any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any
certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required
by applicable securities Laws.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company agrees and acknowledges that, in any appraisal
proceeding under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares,
the Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered by Purchaser to the Company
in payment for the Top-Up Shares should be considered in connection with the
determination of the fair market value of the shares of Company Common Stock
held by dissenting stockholders in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

Section 2.4. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, (i) Purchaser shall be merged with and into
the Company in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, and the separate
existence of Purchaser shall cease and (ii) the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall
continue its corporate existence under the DGCL. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of
Purchaser shall vest in the Company as the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation
may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any action (including
executing and delivering any document) in the name and on behalf of either
the Company or Purchaser in order to carry out and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall
thereafter be responsible and liable for all the liabilities and obligations
of the Company and Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and any other Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Parent shall collectively own at least one share of Company
Common Stock more than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, following the satisfaction or waiver (by the parties) of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , Parent and the Company hereby
agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective, without a meeting of the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as promptly as
practicable

 



-17-  Section 2.5. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New
York, New York 10022, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date designated by the
Company which is reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which shall be as soon
as practicable, but not later than two (2) Business Days, after satisfaction
or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature must be satisfied on the Closing Date),
or at such other place, time and date as the parties hereto shall agree. The
date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing
Date_."

Section 2.6. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable during the Closing, Purchaser and the
Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing all necessary
documentation, including a Certificate of Merger, with the Secretary of State
as provided in the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State, or such later time as is agreed upon by the parties hereto
and specified in the Certificate of Merger. The time when the Merger becomes
effective is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

Section 2.7. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate and Company By-
Laws, by virtue of the Merger, shall be amended in their entirety to read as
set forth in _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ hereto, respectively, and as so
amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law (subject to _Section 6.7(b)_ hereof).

 

Section 2.8. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Purchaser and the officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the DGCL
and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.9. _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions
of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed
to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney
to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law and
to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm
title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 



-18-  Section 2.10. _Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
rights of the Company under _Sections 6.2(c)_ and  _8.1(c)_ ), if the
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is required by Law
(including if the conditions to the Top-Up Option are not satisfied or the
Top-Up Option is for any reason deemed to be invalid or unenforceable), the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall:

(i) as soon as reasonably practicable following the acceptance for payment by
Purchaser of any shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the
" _Acceptance Time_ "), prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy
statement (such proxy statement, as amended and supplemented, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by the Exchange Act in the Proxy Statement and, after
consultation with Parent, Purchaser and their counsel, to respond promptly to
any comments received from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy
Statement and cause to be mailed to the Companys stockholders a definitive
Proxy Statement, a copy of this Agreement or a summary thereof and a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL (relating to dissenters rights) and (y) subject to
the proviso in _Section 2.10(a)(ii)_, obtain the necessary approval and
adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders;

(ii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation referred to in
_Section 4.3(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such recommendation may be
withdrawn, modified or amended, in each case (x) in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_ or (y) other than in connection with an
Alternative Proposal, if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys outside counsel) that the failure to do
so could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; and

(iii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") for the
purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening
the Stockholders Meeting if the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys outside counsel) that the
failure to do so could reasonably be determined to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) Parent and Purchaser shall in the case of a Stockholders Meeting, cause
all shares of the Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and all
other shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of
their affiliates to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

(c) The Company, Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of any Proxy Statement required hereunder. Parent, Purchaser and

Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel, promptly after
receipt thereof, with copies of any written comments or other material
communications the

 



-19-   Company or its counsel receives from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement, and with copies of any written responses
to and telephonic notification of any material verbal responses received from
the SEC or its staff by the Company or its counsel with respect to the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders the Company shall become aware of the occurrence of
any event or other circumstance relating to it or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as to which an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
shall be required, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
stockholders such amendment or supplement. The Company shall not mail the
Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, without reasonable
advance consultation with Parent, Purchaser and their counsel.

 

(d) The Company agrees that the information relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries contained in the Proxy Statement, or in any other
document filed in connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions
with any other Governmental Entity (to the extent such information was
provided by the Company for inclusion therein), at the respective times that
the applicable document is filed with the SEC or such other Governmental
Entity and (if applicable) first mailed or otherwise disseminated to
stockholders of the Company and, in addition, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the date it or any amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to
the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, will

the respective times that the applicable document is filed with the SEC or
such other Governmental Entity and first mailed or otherwise disseminated to
stockholders of the Company and, in addition, in the case of the
Proxy Statement, at the date it or any amendment or supplement thereto is
mailed to the Companys stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

ARTICLE III __

_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_

 

Section 3.1. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Purchaser or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company, Parent
or Purchaser:

(a)  _Common Stock of Purchaser_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



-20-  (b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. All Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of
Parent, Purchaser and any other Subsidiary of Parent, and all Shares held in
the treasury of the Company or owned by any Company Subsidiary, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(i) _Series A Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive $5.00 in cash, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with this
_Article III_ (the " _Series A Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender and
exchange of a Certificate.

(ii) _Common Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with this _Article
III_ (the " _Common Share Merger Consideration_ " ), upon surrender and
exchange of a Certificate.

For all purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Merger Consideration_ "
means, with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Merger
Consideration and, with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock, the
Common Share Merger Consideration.

 

(iii) _Cancellation_. All such Shares when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such outstanding
Share (other than any Dissenting Share) (a " _Certificate_ " ) and each non-
certificated share of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (other
than any Dissenting Shares) (a " _Book Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with _Section 3.2_.

(d) _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for
Shares) with a record date during such period, then the applicable Merger
Consideration payable under _Section 3.1(c)_ in respect of such Shares shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 



-21-  Section 3.2. _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_
") to receive, for the benefit of the Company stockholders, funds representing
the aggregate Merger Consideration to which Company stockholders shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and for the purpose of exchanging the
Merger Consideration for Certificates or Book Entry Shares. The Paying Agent
shall also act as the agent for the Company stockholders for the purpose of
holding the Certificates and shall obtain no rights or interests in the
shares represented by such Certificates. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, funds sufficient
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of Shares
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (such funds being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). For purposes of determining the aggregate amount to be
so deposited, Parent shall assume that no stockholder of the Company shall
perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. If for any reason
(including losses) such funds are inadequate to pay all amounts to which
holders of Shares shall be entitled under _Section 3.1(c)_, Parent shall
promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit
additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required
under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any
event be liable for payment thereof. Such funds shall not be used for any
purpose other than as set forth in this _Article III_ , and shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation solely
in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations
for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged
to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, or (iv) a combination of any of the foregoing.
Parent shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the
Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the exchange of shares and the
Exchange Fund. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced
by, such investments will be payable to Purchaser or Parent, as Parent
directs.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event
not more than the 5th Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record
of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares representing Shares which were converted
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificate to the Paying Agent, or receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares, which letter shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall
mutually agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
each such Certificate or Book Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
total amount of Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry
Shares to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents reasonably requested by the Paying Agent
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration (subject to subsection (e) of this _Section
3.2_) for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry
Shares, and the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration

 



-22-   is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or transferred Book Entry Shares is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment of such Merger Consideration that either (i)
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, in each case, as determined by the Paying Agent and as
set forth in the letter of transmittal and related instructions and (ii) the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid to the Paying Agent in advance
any Tax required by reason of the payment of such Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book Entry
Shares surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate
and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and Book Entry Share as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2_. No interest will be paid or accrue upon
the cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. After the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book
Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law and, without
limitation of the foregoing, subject to the Surviving Corporations obligation
to pay any and all dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which may have been declared by the Company on Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the
Paying Agent for the payment of Merger Consideration and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, which shall thereafter act as the Paying Agent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law), as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book Entry Shares, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding Taxes_. The right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be subject to any applicable
requirements with respect to the withholding of any Tax. To the extent amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, (i)
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book Entry Shares in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made and (ii) Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, to promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental
Entity.

 



-23-  (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the
delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation on account
of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the total amount of Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as
determined in accordance with this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who
shall have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until
the applicable holder fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holders rights to
receive payment of the fair value of such holders Shares under Section 262
of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to comply
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent notice of any
written demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company under Section
262 of the

 

DGCL, and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 3.4. _Restricted Stock Award_. Each holder of a restricted share of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plan (the " _Restricted
Shares_ ") shall have the right to tender such Restricted Share into the
Offer. Effective upon Acceptance Time, each Restricted Share (whether tendered
into the Offer or not) shall become fully vested, and, to the extent not
withheld by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations, shall be
treated the same as other outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 3.4 under the Company Equity Plan and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all notices
and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Purchaser simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ " ), and except as disclosed in

and Purchaser as follows:

Section 4.1. _Corporate Organization_. 

(a) Each of the Company and the Material Company Subsidiaries is (i) in the
case of the Company, a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, and each has the requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except for the failure to be so incorporated
(or formed, as the case may be), existing and in good standing or to have
such power and authority as would not be reasonably expected to have, when
aggregated with all such other failures, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and the Material Company Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not be
reasonably expected to have, when aggregated with all other such failures, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The copies of the Company Certificate, as amended (the " _Company
Certificate_ "), and Company By-Laws, as amended (the " _Company By-Laws_ "),
most recently filed with the Companys SEC Documents are complete and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.2. _Capitalization_.

date of this Agreement, except (A) as provided in this Agreement and (B) for
the conversion rights of the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in the
Series A Certificate of Designations, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, commitments, stock appreciation rights or similar
derivative securities, or agreements of any character calling for the purchase

-25-  (b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, each Material Company Subsidiary. The Company owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each of the Material Company
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, except for (i) Liens imposed under

Credit Agreement (or any replacement thereof). All such shares of capital
stock or other equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and

the Material Company Subsidiaries, other than with respect to Liens arising
under the Company Credit Agreement (or any replacement thereof). There are no
restrictions on the Company with respect to voting the stock of any Material
Company Subsidiary. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
voting trusts, proxies or similar agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound with respect to the voting of any equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(c) The Company has sufficient authorized shares of Company Common Stock to
issue the Top-Up Shares to Purchaser if only the Minimum Tender Condition of
Company Common Stock is validly tendered and Purchaser exercises the Top-Up
Option.

 

Section 4.3. _Authority_.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions to be consummated by
it, subject to the Company obtaining, prior to the Effective Time if required
by Law, the vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding Company Common
Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "). The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this

Statement, at the date such materials are first mailed to the Companys
stockholders and, if a Stockholders Meeting is required by applicable Law, at
the time of such Stockholders Meeting, will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and

result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits or (iii) result in any payment (whether severance pay or otherwise)

that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could reasonably be expected to subject the Company to a material Tax
or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a violation of Section 406 of ERISA that would reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) To the extent that any noncompliance, operation or maintenance would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Benefit
Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (i) complies, and at all relevant
times after December 31, 2008 has complied, both in form and operation, with

in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of the laws of each
jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those
laws are applicable to such Foreign Plan, (ii) the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has complied with all applicable reporting and notice requirements,
and such Foreign Plan has obtained from the Governmental Entity having

Parent has delivered to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of

other contingences related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as set forth in or expressly contemplated by the
Financing Commitments. No event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of

payable by either of them). The Financing Commitments contain all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
Financing available to Parent or Purchaser on the terms therein, and Parent
and Purchaser have no reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent
to the Financing will not be satisfied in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions or that the Financing will not be available to Purchaser on
the Closing Date. Parent and Purchaser have obtained the consent of the
lenders under the Financing Commitments to publicly file the Financing
Commitments with the SEC if requested by the SEC or required by Law. Parent
and Purchaser shall, and shall cause CJAC to, comply with and accept any
"flex" terms contained in any of the Financing Commitments as may be necessary

acquisition of all shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the Merger, as the case may be, and payment of all fees, expenses
and other amounts related to the Transactions or the Financing), and
immediately after the consummation of the Transactions, each of Parent and the

and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than the amounts
required to pay its debts and other liabilities (including a reasonable
estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become due; and
(ii) shall not have unreasonably small capital to carry on the businesses in
which is it engaged or proposed to be engaged. For all purposes of this
Agreement, clauses (i) and (ii) shall mean that each of Parent and the

asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets or any of their respective officers or directors (in their capacity as

Subsidiaries) before any Governmental Entity.

supplied by the Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information,

forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and (c) that

disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet of the Parent as of September 30,
2011 (including the notes thereto) that are included in the Parent Financial
Statements and liabilities and obligations since such date incurred in
the ordinary course of businesses consistent with past practices or under

-51-  Section 6.2. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company agrees that (i) the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall not, and neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall authorize any of their respective Representatives
to, initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing
non-public information) the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons or engage in any substantive discussions or
negotiations concerning, or provide any non-public information with respect
to, an Alternative Proposal and (ii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall cease, and instruct their respective Representatives to cease, any
existing solicitation, substantive discussions or negotiations by or on behalf
of the Company with any Person(s) conducted theretofore with respect to any
Alternative Proposal and shall request each person that has received any
confidential information relating to the Company in connection with the
Companys March 2011 solicitation of acquisition proposals to return or
destroy all such confidential information.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company (directly or through its Representatives) may: 

(i) until the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Time and the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approvals, engage in substantive discussions or
negotiations with a Person or group of Persons that makes a bona fide
Alternative Proposal and may furnish to such Person(s) and its/their
Representatives information concerning, and may afford such Person(s) and
its/their Representatives access to, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and their businesses, properties, assets, books and records, if (x) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor and outside counsel), such Alternative Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (y)
prior to furnishing such information or access to, or entering into
substantive discussions (except as to the existence of this _Section 6.2_ or
to ask such Person(s) to clarify the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal) or negotiations with, such Person(s), (A) the Company receives from
such Person(s) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) the
Company notifies Parent to the effect that it intends to furnish information
or access to, or intends to enter into substantive discussions or negotiations
with, such Person(s);

 

(ii) comply with Rules 14e-2 and 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer;

(iii) make "stop-look-and-listen" communications with respect to an
Alternative Proposal of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act; and

(iv) make any other disclosure to the Companys stockholders, and take any
other action, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure or take such other action could reasonably be determined to be
inconsistent with applicable Law.

 



-52-  (c) The Company Board may not (i) (A) withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of the Offer,
the Merger or this Agreement (except as set forth in clause (y) of the proviso
in _Section 2.10(a)(ii) _or as set forth below in this  _Section 6.2(c)_)
or (B) approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company an Alternative
Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) cause the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Alternative
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the earlier
to occur of the Acceptance Time and the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approvals, (x) the Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
other than in connection with an Alternative Proposal if the Company Board
(after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel)
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action could reasonably
be determined to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law or (y) in response to an Alternative
Proposal, if the Company Board (after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor and outside counsel) determines in good faith that any
Alternative Proposal referred to in clause (i) of _Section 6.2(b)_
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may:

(i) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger
and this Agreement;

(ii) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal;

(iii) cause the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into a
binding written agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "
_Superior Proposal Agreement_ "); or

(iv) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)_;

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) prior to taking any action pursuant to
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this _Section 6.2(c)_, the Company shall
give Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice (the "
_Notice Period_ ") thereof; which notice shall state that the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, and include a copy of all relevant documents
relating to the Superior Proposal and a written summary of the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal not made in writing and the identity
of the Person or "group" making the Superior Proposal , attaching the Superior
Proposal Agreement (or, if applicable, the latest draft of the Superior
Proposal Agreement), which notice need only be given once with respect to any
Superior Proposal, unless such Superior Proposal is modified in any material
respect in which case a new Notice Period will begin, (B) during the Notice
Period, the Company shall have negotiated with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith (to the extent Parent and Purchaser desire to negotiate) with
respect to any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would permit the Company Board not to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and (C) following the Notice Period the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) after taking into account any such modifications, changes or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company (taking into account,
among other things, (I) the terms of such offer and (II) such legal,
financial, regulatory, timing, financing, conditionality (i.e. closing
conditions) and other aspects of such offer which the Company Board deems
relevant), that

 



-53-   (x) failure to effect the Adverse Recommendation Change action still would
reasonably likely be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) if the intended Adverse Recommendation Change is the
result of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes were to be given effect.

 

Section 6.3. _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, none of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or
any of the other Transactions without the prior written approval of the
Company and Parent, as the case may be, except as may be required by Law or by
any listing agreement with a securities exchange as determined in the good
faith judgment of the party wanting to make such release or announcement;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to obtain the prior
written approval of Parent in connection with any press release or public
announcement that the Company Board has made an Adverse Recommendation Change
or resolved to do so.

 

Section 6.4. _Access to Information_.

(a) During the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives of Parent access to
senior executives of the Company to answer Parents questions concerning the
business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and access to the Companys and each of the Company Subsidiaries properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, in each case, as reasonably
requested by Parent including, if reasonably requested, making available any
corporate management personnel and other employees at the general manager
level and above of the Company by travel to Parents corporate offices in
Houston, Texas, for limited time periods (which shall not exceed two
consecutive Business Days) at Parents sole expense and upon reasonable
advance notice;  _provided_ , that in each case, such access shall be given
at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice and Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business, operations or personnel of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries and it is expressly agreed that such
access shall in no way include any Phase II investigation or other invasive
procedure or investigation, including without limitation any sampling,
testing or the removal of materials from the offices and properties of the
Company. From the Business Day following the date of this Agreement until this
Agreement is terminated, Parent and Purchaser shall be provided, at
the Companys corporate office location, such office space as is reasonably
requested by Parent for its Representatives to have access to the books and
records and, subject to _Section 6.4(b)_ the employees, of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, such access shall
include, but not be limited to, reasonable access to, and cooperation from,
the Companys information technology systems and, subject to _Section
6.4(b)_, employees to permit the integration of such systems with those of
Parents and Purchasers own systems. Subject to _Section 6.4(b)_, the
Company shall cooperate with Representatives of Parent, including making a
representative or representatives knowledgeable about the operations
(including in relation to environmental, health and safety matters) of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries available for questions and discussions.
From the Business Day following the date of this Agreement until this
Agreement is terminated,

 



-54-   Parent and Purchaser shall be provided reasonable access at reasonable times
and upon reasonable notice to each of the Companys restaurants and Parent and
its Representatives shall conduct any such activities under the supervision
of one or more designated employees of the Company and in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business, operations or personnel of the
Companys restaurants. The Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit the
access to any designated office space, documents or information (including to
the Companys information systems and computer networks) or limit the access
or communication to its employees or any landlord to the extent that (i) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access
to such documents or information, (ii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such
documents or information; (iii) access to such documents or information would
violate any obligation of confidentiality by the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company existing on the date hereof, or (iv) access to a Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound
would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to
terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract.

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, all requests for access shall be made
to such Representatives of the Company as it shall designate, who shall be
solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and access thereunder.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with the respective employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries regarding the businesses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any of the Transactions without first
obtaining the reasonable consent of the Company in writing.

(c) The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information provided pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_, and neither Purchaser nor
Parent may rely on the accuracy of any such information, other than as
expressly set forth in the Companys representations and warranties in
_Article IV_.

(d) The information provided pursuant to  _Section 6.4(a)_ will be used
solely for the purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5. _Further Assurances; Regulatory Matters_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use)
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such party with respect to the Offer, the Top-Up
Option, the Merger or the other Transactions and, subject to the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and (ii) promptly to prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other
documents, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all necessary permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all 

 



-55-   Governmental Entities necessary or advisable in connection with consummating
the Transactions, including the Company Required Governmental Approvals and
Parent Required Governmental Approvals. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.5(a)_, each party shall, within
ten (10) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, file all
necessary documentation required to obtain termination of applicable waiting
periods for the Transactions under the HSR Act. Parent and Purchaser shall,
and Parent shall cause Affiliates of Parent and Purchaser to, vote all shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them (including all Shares
which have been accepted for payment pursuant to _Article III_ ) in favor of
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at any stockholders meeting at which
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger is voted upon. From the date
hereof until the Closing Date, each of Parent, Purchaser and the other
Affiliates of Parent shall not acquire Company Common Stock, except pursuant
to the Offer. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, other than pursuant
to the Offer and the Top-Up Option Parent, Purchaser and the other Affiliates
of Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, sell, assign, transfer, tender,
pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any Shares beneficially owned by
Parent, Purchaser and the other Affiliates of Parent to any Person.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
hereto contained in  _Section 6.5(a)_, each of the parties hereto shall use
(and Parent shall cause its Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to
resolve all objections, if any, to the Transactions by any Governmental Entity
under the HSR Act and ensure the expiration of all waiting periods under the
HSR Act, including reaching an agreement, settlement or consent providing for
divestiture, a "hold separate" agreement, contractual undertakings with third
Persons or any other relief with the Governmental Entity investigating the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. In connection with the
foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including
any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as violative of the HSR Act or
any other antitrust Law or other Law in any jurisdiction, the parties hereto
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use (and Parent
shall cause its Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of any of the Transactions, including defending through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any such action or proceeding
by any Person.

 

Section 6.6. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform in
accordance with their terms all the Benefit Plans. 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for at
least one (1) year following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, provide each
employee of the Company (or any of the Company Subsidiaries) employed by the
Surviving Corporation (or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) with
compensation (including base salary or wages and incentive compensation
opportunities) and benefits that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than equity
based benefits and individual employment agreements) currently provided to
similarly situated employees of HoldCo, Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
operating in similar concept restaurants.

 



-56-  (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries to, (i) credit all service with the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including service recognized by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries for service with other Persons) for all purposes
(other than benefit accrual under a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(35) of ERISA) under any employee benefit plan, policy or program
applicable to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries after the Closing, (ii) waive any waiting period, pre-
existing condition or limitation or exclusion and any actively-at-work
requirement with respect to employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and their dependents under any group health plan or other
welfare benefit plan, and (iii) recognize the dollar amount of all expenses
incurred by employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
their dependents in the plan year in which such employees begin to
participate in a group health plan of Parent or any of Parents Affiliates or
Subsidiaries for purposes of deductibles, co-payments and maximum out-of-
pocket limits under any such group health plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such credit shall not be used to determine benefit accruals, except with
respect to severance and vacation benefits.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6_, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to, pay severance benefits to any employee of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries who was an employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and whose employment with the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries is terminated within one (1) year following the Effective Time
in amounts no less favorable than the amount of severance benefits to which
such employee shall be entitled based on the formula set forth on Section
6.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;  _provided_ , that payment of such
severance may be conditioned on such employee entering into a severance
agreement in the same form as required by Parent, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates in connection with severance of similarly situated employees of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.6_, the
parties expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) this Agreement is not
intended to create a contract between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any employee, on
the other hand, and no employee may rely on this Agreement as the basis for
any breach of contract claim against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries; (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed or construed to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates or Subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular employee
for any period after Closing; (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent,
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries; (iv) nothing
in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to limit the right of Parent,
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any employee during any period after Closing; and (v)
nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Benefit Plan of Parent,
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries or other
agreement, plan, program, or document.

 



-57-  (f) With respect to annual bonuses for calendar year 2011 (the "
_2011 Bonuses_ "), each participant in the annual bonus plans maintained by
the Company listed on Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Company Bonus Plans_ ") shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation (or an Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation) the 2011
Bonuses earned by such participant under the applicable Company Bonus Plan in
the amounts as set forth on Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
solely based on the achievement of the performance criteria established by
the Company with respect to such 2011 Bonuses as set forth on Section 6.6(f)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule unless such participants employment is
terminated by the participant without Good Reason or by the Company for Cause
(as such terms are defined on Section 6.6(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) in each case, prior to the bonus payment date. If owed, the 2011
Bonuses shall be paid promptly following the audit of the financial
statements of the Company for the 2011 fiscal year.

(g) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board or the board of directors
of the appropriate Company Subsidiary shall adopt a resolution stating that
each of the following Benefit Plans shall terminate effective on the day
preceding the Acceptance Time (or as of such other time as the Parent and
the Company mutually agree), but contingent upon the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time: (i) each Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Code, (ii)
each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of the
PRIRC, and (iii) each Benefit Plan that is intended to be a registered
retirement savings plan under the Income Tax Act (Canada).

 

Section 6.7. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted under the DGCL or other applicable Law, each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such
prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ ,"
and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any and all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements), obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges), fines, liabilities,
judgments, and amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) (collectively, " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, serving as a witness
with respect to or otherwise participating in (and including preparation for
any of the foregoing) any pending, threatened, asserted or completed claim,
action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation (including, without
limitation, any action brought by an Indemnified Party under this _Section
6.7_ any action on appeal, or any arbitration or other alternative
dispute resolution mechanism), whether civil or criminal, and whether
instituted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Governmental Entity
or any other party, (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") based in whole 

 



-58-   or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole
or in part to (i) the fact that such Person is or was an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (or served at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)) or (ii)
matters occurring or existing at or prior to the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any Benefit Plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after, the Effective Time. In the event that any claim for Indemnified
Liabilities is asserted or made by an Indemnified Party, such claim is deemed
to be Indemnified Liabilities unless finally adjudicated by a court of law
under DGCL or there is a determination made with respect to whether such
Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
DGCL or other applicable Law made by independent legal counsel selected by
such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation
(it being understood and agreed that the burden of proof shall be on Parent
and the Surviving Corporation to establish that such Indemnified Party does
not so comply). Unless and until such final adjudication or independent
counsel determination is made Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of each
Indemnified Party in connection with any Proceeding as such expenses
(including attorneys fees and disbursements) are incurred upon receipt from
such Indemnified Party of a request therefor (accompanied by invoices or other
relevant documentation), _provided_ (if and to the extent required by the DGCL
or other applicable Law) that such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such
amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified under the DGCL or other applicable Law with respect
to such Proceeding. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Party (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of
such matter, _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in such
Proceeding without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and
to the extent the terms of the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment
involve any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified Party.

(b) All rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of any of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the Company Certificate or Company
By-Laws (or comparable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries)
as in effect as of the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto. The Surviving Corporation
shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to,
distribute or dispose of assets in a manner that would render the Surviving
Corporation unable to satisfy any of its obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.7_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect the
current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by or
for the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by such policies as of the Effective Time with
respect

 



-59-   to claims arising in whole or in part from matters occurring or allegedly
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (provided that the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least as
beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable
carriers having a rating comparable to the Companys current carrier);
_provided_ , _however_ , that each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, first use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
a "tail" policy on substantially the same terms and conditions for claims
arising out of acts or conduct occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and
effective for claims asserted prior to or during the six (6)-year period
referred to above (and, with respect to claims made prior to or during such
period, until final resolution thereof), and only if Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries are unable, after exerting commercially
reasonable efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, then Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain such
coverage from such carriers in annual policies; and, _provided_ , _further_
that (i) if the existing policies expire or are terminated or cancelled
during such six (6)-year period, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are at least as beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies with
reputable carriers having a rating comparable to the Companys
current carrier, (ii) Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall not be required to spend as an annual
premium therefor an amount in excess of 150% of the premium therefor as of the
date of this Agreement and (iii) if, during such six (6)-year period, such
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for an
amount in excess of 150% of the current annual premium therefor, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much directors and
officers liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for an amount equal
to 150% of the current annual premium therefor, on terms and conditions
substantially similar to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing
directors and officers liability insurance.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the Effective Time the Company shall be permitted to purchase prepaid "tail"
policies in favor of the individuals referred to in _Section 6.7(c)_ with
respect to the matters described therein (provided that the premium therefor
shall not exceed 150% of the annual premium therefor as of the date of this
Agreement). If and to the extent such policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in effect and continue to honor the obligations of the
Company thereunder.

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform in accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and any director or officer of the Company, on the other hand.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who is now, or who has
been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her
personal representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Parent and 

 



-60-   the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns, (iii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have, whether
pursuant to Law, Contract, any Benefit Plan, the Company Certificate or
Company By-Laws (or comparable organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation), or otherwise and (iv)
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the consent of such Indemnified Party.

 

(g) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_
") (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all the
obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this  _Section 6.7_. In
addition, if upon or following any merger, consolidation or sale of assets any
Indemnifying Party is or becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another
Person, the ultimate parent entity of such Indemnifying Party shall guaranty
the obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8.  _Obligations of Parent and Purchaser_. Prior to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_:

(a) Purchaser shall not, Parent shall cause Purchaser not to and FEI shall
cause HoldCo not to, undertake any business or activities other than in
connection with this Agreement and engaging in the Offer, the Top-Up Option,
the Merger and the other Transactions (including the financing thereof).

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

(c) Parent and Purchaser shall not (and FEI shall cause the other Affiliates
of Parent not to) engage in any action or enter into any transaction or
permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into that could
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the consummation of, or otherwise
adversely affect, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions (including the financing thereof).

(d) Except as expressly contemplated, required or permitted by this Agreement
or the Financing Commitments, or required by Law, during the period from the
date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_, FEI shall cause HoldCo
not to, and the Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
(including Purchaser and CJAC) to, without the prior written consent of the
Company:

(i) incur, create or modify any indebtedness for borrowed money or guarantee
any such indebtedness or make any loans or advances to any Person other than
the Financing, except in any such case trade payables incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

 



-61-  (ii) declare, set aside for payment or pay any dividend, or make any other
distribution in respect of any shares of its capital stock, or otherwise make
any payments to stockholders in their capacity as such;

(iii) enter into or amend in any material manner any contract, agreement or
commitment with any former or present director, officer or direct or indirect
shareholder of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with any Affiliate or
associate (as defined under the Exchange Act) of any of the foregoing Persons
other than, with respect to agreements existing as of the date hereof and
provided to the Company, in a manner that is more advantageous to the Parent
or Purchaser (or its Subsidiary) than the original underlying agreement;

(iv) engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any action
to be taken or transaction to be entered into that is prohibited under the
terms of the Financing Commitments or could reasonably be expected to cause a
condition to the closing of the Financing Commitments not to be satisfied or
the funding under the Financing Commitments to be delayed; and

(v) make any commitment to take any of the actions prohibited by this 
_Section 6.8(d)_.

Section 6.9. _Financing_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best
efforts to arrange the Financing, including entering into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions in accordance with
those set forth in the Financing Commitments. In the event that any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable so as not to enable Parent and Purchaser
to proceed with the Transactions in a timely manner, Parent and Purchaser
shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternate
financing from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms (to
Parent and Purchaser) than those set forth in the Financing Commitments as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including
entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive
agreements entered into pursuant to the first or second sentence of this
_Section 6.9(a_) being referred to as the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_
"). Parent and Purchaser shall, shall cause their Affiliates to, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to, comply with
the terms and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions of the Financing
Commitments, any alternate financing commitments and the Definitive Financing
Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material breach of
any of the Financing Commitments, the Definitive Financing Agreements, any
alternate financing commitment and any related fee and engagement letters by
Parent or Purchaser shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this  _Section
6.9(a)_. Parent shall (i) furnish complete, correct and executed copies of the
Definitive Financing Agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution,
(ii) give the Company prompt notice (x) of any breach by any party of, or
material dispute or disagreement between any of the parties to, the Financing
Commitments, any alternate financing commitment

 



-62-   or the Definitive Financing Agreements of which Parent or Purchaser becomes
aware or any termination thereof or (y) if for any reason Parent or Purchaser
believes in good faith that it is reasonably likely that it will not be able
to obtain all or any material portion of the Financing in the amounts or from
the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments and that it is not
reasonably likely that it will be able to obtain acceptable alternative
financing and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacements thereof).
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to their
respective obligations to effect the Merger.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the respective officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including
legal and accounting advisors, of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to,
provide to Parent and Purchaser any cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
and Purchaser in connection with the arrangement of debt financing for any
portion of the aggregate funds to consummate the Offer and the Merger,
including, without limitation, (i) furnishing Parent, Purchaser and their
financing sources, as promptly as reasonably practicable, with financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as may reasonably be requested in writing by Parent and identifying any
portion of such information that constitutes material non-public
information, (ii) in each case upon reasonable notice and in reasonably
convenient locations, making senior management of the Company available to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with prospective lenders,
investors and rating agencies in connection with the financing, (iii)
assisting with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency
presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate, credit and
facility ratings from ratings agencies), offering documents, private placement
memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and all other material to
be used in connection with the financing (including customary authorization
and management representation letters) and all documentation and other
information required in connection with applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including U.S.A. Patriot Act
of 2001, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort
letters as reasonably requested by Parent, (v) entering into one or more
credit or other agreements on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
Purchaser in connection with such debt financing immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, (vi) taking all corporate actions, subject to and only
effective upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, required to permit the
consummation of the financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made
available to the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Acceptance Time,
and (vii) otherwise taking actions within its control to cooperate in
satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in any definitive document
related to the financing; provided, however, that (A) no obligation of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any such credit or other
agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time, (B) nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
(C) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required
to pay any commitment fee or similar fee or incur any liability with respect
to such debt financing prior to the Effective Time and (D) in no event shall
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be required to make any
representations or warranties regarding Parent, Purchaser,

 



-63-   Holdco or their respective Affiliates. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing cooperation, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of such debt
financing and any information utilized in connection therewith to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and with appropriate contribution
to the extent such indemnification is not available (other than arising from
(x) such Persons fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation or (y) material misstatements or omissions in
written historical information of the type prepared by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business that is provided by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use in
connection with the debt financing). The information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.9_ will be used solely for the purpose of effecting the
Transactions and will be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Debt
Financing Sources a final confidential information memorandum satisfying the
requirements of the Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement but in any event no later than January 3, 2012.

Section 6.10. _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall control, and the
Company shall, subject to such limitations as counsel to the Company
reasonably determines are necessary to protect any attorney-client privilege
of the Company, give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of
any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not settle or offer to
settle any claim, action, suit, charge, investigation or proceeding against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) other than the settlement of litigation
concerning this Agreement or any of the Transactions that do not involve any
monetary payment (other than as may be permitted by _Section 6.1(i)_) or
other ongoing obligation of the Company and that would otherwise not
materially impact the operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. The Company shall not cooperate with any Person that may
seek to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall, subject to such
limitations as counsel to the Company reasonably determines are necessary to
protect any attorney-client privilege of the Company, cooperate with Parent
and Purchaser in resisting any such effort to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or
otherwise oppose such transactions.

 

Section 6.11. _State Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover statute or
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up
Option, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall (a) take
all reasonable action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such takeover statute or Law.

 



-64-  Section 6.12. _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to
the extent permitted by Law, the Company (acting through its Board,
compensation committee or its independent directors, to the extent required)
will take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on or after the date hereof with any officer, director or employee that holds
Shares pursuant to which compensation is paid to such officer, director or
employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act and to otherwise satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.13. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Shares (including any derivative securities with respect thereto) resulting
from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.14. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of The New York Stock Exchange to cause the
delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock and Series A

indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify such
person (or the heirs, executors or administrators of such person) in

trustee of a trust at the request of the Corporation. 

E. The rights and authority conferred in this Article XI shall not be
exclusive of any other right that any person may otherwise have or hereafter
acquire.

more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any

no alternate member has been designated by the Board of Directors, the member
or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of the absent or
disqualified member. Except as limited by law, each committee, to the extent
provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing it, shall
have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation.

Section 14\. _Operation of Committees_. A majority of all the members of a
committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the

at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be
