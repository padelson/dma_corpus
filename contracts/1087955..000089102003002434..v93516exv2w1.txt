Agreement   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (this "Agreement"), is entered into as of October 8, 2003 by and among
Emulex Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Aviary Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Purchaser"), and Vixel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").   RECITALS   A. The Board of Directors of each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company has approved, and deems it advisable and in the
best interests of its respective stockholders to consummate, the acquisition
of the Company by Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.   B. In furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Purchaser
commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer") to acquire (i) all shares of the
issued and outstanding common stock, par value $.0015 per share (the "Common
Stock"), of the Company (together with any associated preferred stock or
other rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as
of November 15, 2000, between the Company and Computer Share Trust Company,
Inc. (as the same has been amended through the date hereof, the "Rights
Agreement")) and (ii) all shares of the issued and outstanding Series B
convertible preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Series B
Preferred Stock" and, together with the Common Stock and the associated
Rights, the "Shares"), for $10.00 per Share, net to the seller thereof in
cash (such price, or any such higher price per Share as may be paid in the
Offer, referred to herein as the "Offer Price"), subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.   C. The Board of Directors of each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company has approved this Agreement, the Purchaser
Option (as defined in Recital F) and the Transactions (as defined in Section
9.4(h)), including the Merger (as defined in Section 1.4) following the Offer
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Such approval of this
Agreement, the Purchaser Option and the Transactions, including the Merger,
by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board of Directors")
was unanimous.   D. The Company Board of Directors has unanimously
determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer and
the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the
holders of such Shares and has recommended that the holders of such Shares
accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer and has
further unanimously determined that this Agreement is advisable and
recommended that, following the Offer, the stockholders of the Company
approve and adopt this Agreement and each of the Transactions upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein.   E. Contemporaneously with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company (each, a "Stockholder") are
entering into a Stockholders Agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement") in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to    1  which each such
Stockholder has agreed, among other things, to tender his, her or its Shares
in the Offer and to grant Parent a proxy with respect to the voting of such
Shares in favor of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein.   F. As a condition and further inducement to Parent and
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth
herein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Purchaser and the Company are entering into a Stock Option Agreement in the
form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Purchaser Option"), pursuant to which, among
other things, the Company has granted Purchaser an option to purchase certain
newly-issued shares of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, subject to
certain conditions.   G. In addition, contemporaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to
Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
employees of the Company are entering into Non-Competition Agreements with
Parent in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit C (collectively, the "Non-
Competition Agreements").   H. The Company, Parent and Purchaser desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, the parties
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE OFFER AND THE MERGER   1.1 The
Offer.   (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Section 8.1 and none of the events set forth in Annex I
hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Purchaser shall commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
the "Exchange Act")) the Offer as promptly as practicable on or after October
15, 2003 and the Offer shall remain open at least twenty (20) business days
(as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act) from commencement of the
Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date"). The obligation of Purchaser to accept
for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance
with requirements of this Section 1.1(a)) shall be subject only to (i) there
being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
(x) that number of shares of Common Stock which, together with any shares of
Common Stock then owned by Parent or Purchaser (without giving effect to
shares subject to purchase under the Purchaser Option or the Stockholders
Agreements), represents greater than 50.1% of the shares of Common Stock
outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis and (y) there being validly tendered and
not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock which, together with any shares of Series B
Preferred then owned by Parent or Purchaser (without giving effect to   
2  shares subject to purchase under the Purchaser Option or the
Stockholders Agreements), represents greater than 50.1% of the Series B
Preferred Stock outstanding on a Fully Diluted Basis (clauses (x) and (y)
together, the "Minimum Condition"); and (ii) the other conditions set forth
in Annex I hereto. As used in this Agreement, "Fully Diluted Basis" shall
refer, with respect to the Common Stock, to the number of shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding at any time after taking into account all shares
of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of convertible securities (other
than the shares of Series B Preferred Stock) or upon the exercise of any
options, warrants or other rights to purchase shares of Common Stock (whether
or not exercised or converted at the time of determination) and, with respect
to the Series B Preferred Stock, to the number of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at any time after taking into account
all shares of Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon the conversion of
convertible securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or other
rights to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock (whether or not
converted at the time of determination). Subject to the prior satisfaction of
the Minimum Condition and the prior satisfaction or waiver by Parent or
Purchaser of the other conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex I hereto,
Purchaser shall consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept
for payment and pay for all Shares tendered and not withdrawn
promptly following the acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the
Offer. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer
to Purchase") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto.
Parent expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions, to
increase the Offer Price and to make any other changes in the terms of the
Offer; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser not to, waive the Minimum Condition, decrease the Offer Price,
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of
Shares sought in the Offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer, extend
the Offer beyond the Initial Expiration Date except as set forth below, or
amend any other condition of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders
of the Shares, in each case without the prior written consent of the Company
(such consent to be authorized by the Company Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may,
without the consent of the Company, (i) if, at any scheduled expiration
of the Offer any of the conditions to Purchaser\'s obligation to accept
Shares for payment shall not be satisfied or waived, extend the Offer beyond
the Initial Expiration Date for a time period reasonably necessary to permit
such condition to be satisfied, (ii) extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer or
(iii) extend (or re-extend) the Offer for an aggregate period of not more
than five (5) business days beyond the latest applicable date that would
otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, if, as of
such date, all of the conditions to Purchaser\'s obligations to accept Shares
for payment are satisfied or waived, but there shall not have been validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of Shares
necessary on a Fully Diluted Basis to permit the Merger to be effected
without a meeting of the Company\'s stockholders in accordance with the DGCL.
Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. In addition, the Offer
Price may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the extent required
by law in connection with such increase, in each case without the consent of
the Company.   (b) As soon as practicable after the date the Offer is
commenced, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC, pursuant to
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act    3  ("Regulation M-A"), a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The
Schedule TO shall include the summary term sheet required under Regulation
M-A and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (collectively, together with
any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation
referred to in clause (c) of Section 3.4 and the approval of the Board of
Directors referred to in Section 3.4. Parent and Purchaser agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO before it
is filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that
Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of
such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.   1.2 Company
Actions.   (a) On the date the Offer is commenced, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") which shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2,
contain the recommendation referred to in clause (c) of Section 3.4 and the
approval of the Board of Directors referred to in Section 3.4. The Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by law. The Company agrees to take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel shall be given the opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
in writing with any comments, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and to
consult with Parent, Purchaser and their counsel prior to responding to any
such comments, either in written or oral form.   (b) In connection with the
Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent
or Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and all
available    4  listings and computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall
promptly furnish Parent or Purchaser with such information and assistance
(including, but not limited to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated
periodically, and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security
positions) as Parent or Purchaser or their agent(s) may reasonably
request.   1.3 Directors.   (a) Effective upon the purchase of and payment
for any Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any of their affiliates pursuant to
the Offer (the "Appointment Time"), Parent shall be entitled to elect or
designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board of Directors as is equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving effect to the
directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially
owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by Purchaser,
Parent and any of their affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. The Company shall, upon Parent\'s request, use all reasonable
efforts to promptly increase the size of the Company Board of Directors,
including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to
increase the size of the Company Board of Directors, or use all reasonable
efforts to promptly secure the written resignations of such number of its
incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parent\'s
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors,
and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause Parent\'s designees to be so
elected or designated at the Appointment Time. At the Appointment Time, the
Company shall, upon Parent\'s request, also use all reasonable efforts to
cause persons elected or designated by Parent to constitute the same
percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board
of Directors of (i) each committee of the Company Board of Directors; (ii)
each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company subsidiary; and
(iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case only
to the extent permitted by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange
or trading market on which the Company\'s common stock is listed or traded.
The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all actions
required pursuant to such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including, but not limited to, mailing to stockholders (together with
the Schedule 14D-9) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l
as is necessary to enable Parent\'s designees to be elected or designated to
the Company Board of Directors. Parent or Purchaser shall supply the Company
information with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers,
directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-l. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not
limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of
law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.   (b) In the
event that Parent\'s designees are elected or designated to the Company Board
of Directors, then, until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.5), the
Company shall cause the Company Board of Directors to have at least two (2)
directors who are directors on the date hereof including at least two (2)
directors, or such other number as may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq
Stock Market, Inc. (the "Nasdaq"), who are independent directors for purposes
of the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq (the
"Independent Directors");    5  provided, however, that if any
Independent Director is unable to serve due to death or disability, the
remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate
another person (or persons) who serves as a director on the date hereof to
fill such vacancy, and such person (or persons) shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate two
(2) persons, or such other number as may be required by the rules of the
Nasdaq, who are directors on the date hereof (or, in the event there shall be
less than two (2) directors, or such other number as may be required by the
rules of the Nasdaq, available to fill such vacancies as a result of such
persons\' deaths, disabilities or refusals to serve, such smaller number of
persons who are directors on the date hereof) to fill such vacancies and such
persons shall be deemed Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent\'s
designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to the
Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent
Directors (or if only one exists, then the vote of such Independent Director)
shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement by the Company;
(ii) exercise or waive any of the Company\'s rights, benefits or remedies
hereunder, if such action would materially and adversely affect holders of
Shares other than Parent or Purchaser; (iii) amend the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company if such action would materially and
adversely affect holders of Shares other than Parent or Purchaser; or (iv)
take any other action of the Company Board of Directors under or in
connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and adversely
affect holders of Shares other than Parent or Purchaser; provided, however,
that if there shall be no Independent Directors as a result of such persons\'
deaths, disabilities or refusal to serve, then such actions may be effected
by a 66-2/3% vote of the entire Company Board of Directors. The Independent
Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel and other advisors
at the expense of the Company as determined appropriate by a majority of the
Independent Directors.   1.4 The Merger.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and
Purchaser shall consummate a merger (the "Merger") in accordance with the
DGCL pursuant to which (i) Purchaser shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall thereupon
cease; (ii) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in
the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware; (iii) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue
unaffected by the Merger; and (iv) the Company shall succeed to and assume
all the rights and obligations of Purchaser. The corporation surviving the

event that Parent or Purchaser shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of
the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled
to vote on the Merger, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto
agree that, subject to Article VII, Parent and Purchaser shall take, or cause
to be taken, all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger
to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without
a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of
the DGCL.    8   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   2.1
Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser ("Purchaser
Common Stock"):   (a) Purchaser Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding
share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.
All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares
owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion
of Shares. Each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares
(as defined in Section 2.3(a))) shall be converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest and
subject to withholding in accordance with Section 2.7 (the
"Merger Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2.   2.2
Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Paying Agent. Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to
receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(c). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in
immediately available next-day funds in an amount equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration (the "Payment Fund"). For purposes of determining the
amount of Merger Consideration to be so deposited, Parent and Purchaser shall
assume that no stockholder of the Company will perfect any right to appraisal
of his, her or its Shares. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in its sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. In
the event the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy
all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent thereunder,
then Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit cash in the
Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency. Earnings from
such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Shares.    9   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"), whose
shares were converted pursuant to Section 0 into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify); and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
without interest thereon, and shall not evidence any interest in, or any
right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any surrendered Certificate that represents Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to the person surrendering such Certificate.   (c) Transfer Books;
No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (d)
Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following one (1) year after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed
(or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent\'s
routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law to the extent
that such law requires such delivery.   (e) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made    10  against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
thereto.   2.3 Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who complies with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal. From and after the
Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised such appraisal
rights shall not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those provided
under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him
or her in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his,
her or its right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Shares pursuant to Section 2.2.   (b) The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights of
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in the conduct of all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal.   2.4 Stock Option
and Other Plans.   (a) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding stock
option, stock equivalent right or right to acquire Shares (a "Company Option"
or "Company Options") granted under the Company\'s Amended and Restated 1995
Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended), 2000 Non-Officer
Equity Incentive Plan and 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Company ESPP")
(collectively, the "Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable or
vested, shall (without any action on the part of the Company) automatically
be converted into an option to purchase Parent common stock, par value $.01
per share ("Parent Common Stock"), in accordance with this Section 2.4(a).
Each Company Option so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to,
similar terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as are currently
applicable to each such Company Option, except that, as of the Effective
Time, (i) each Company Option shall be exercisable (or shall become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (defined
below), rounded to the nearest whole number, and (ii) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option so converted shall be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Common Stock at which such
Company    11  Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As
used in this Agreement, "Option Exchange Ratio" means the quotient determined
by dividing the Merger Consideration by the average closing prices of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") Composite
Transaction Tape for the five business day period ending two days prior the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion of any Company
Options which are "incentive stock options," within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, into options to purchase Parent Common stock shall be made
so as not to constitute a "modification" of such Company Options within the
meaning of Section 424 of the Code.   (b) (i) As of the Effective Time,
except as provided in this Section 2.4, all rights under any provision of the
Option Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of
the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company
shall take all action necessary to ensure that, as of and after the Effective
Time, except as provided in this Section 2.4, no person shall have any right
under the Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect
to equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary thereof and (ii) upon completion of the existing Offering (as
defined in the Company ESPP), the Company shall not permit a new Offering to
commence under the Company ESPP without the prior written consent
of Parent.   (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery upon the exercise of Company Options assumed in accordance with
Section 2.4(a). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to any
assumed Company Options.   (d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause to be effected any necessary amendments to the Option Plans to
give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4.   2.5 Company
Warrants. If permitted under the terms of the applicable governing
instruments, the Company shall take all necessary action such that, at the
Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding warrant to purchase shares
of Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Warrants") shall have the right
to receive, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock theretofore issuable
upon exercise of such Company Warrant, an amount per share equal to the
excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such
Company Warrant; provided, however, that to the extent the foregoing is not
permissible under the terms of any such Company Warrant, each such Company
Warrant shall, at the Effective Time, be deemed to constitute a warrant to
acquire, upon payment of the aggregate exercise price of such Company
Warrant, and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Warrant prior to the Effective Time, the aggregate Merger
Consideration that the holder of such Company Warrant would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to Article II of this Agreement had such holder
exercised such Company Warrant in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Company shall deliver to each holder of a Company Warrant timely
notice of the Merger in accordance with the provisions thereof. The Company
shall take all necessary actions to provide that as of the Effective Time no
holder of a Company Warrant will    12  have the right to receive shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation upon the exercise of any Company
Warrant.   2.6 Section 16. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
shall each take all such steps as may be required to provide that, with
respect to each Section 16 Affiliate (as defined below), (a) the transactions
contemplated by this section, and (b) any other dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) or other acquisitions of
Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement, shall be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that
certain No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Section 16 Affiliate" shall mean each individual who (a) immediately prior
to the Effective Time is a director or officer of the Company or (b) at the
Effective Time will become a director or officer of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.   2.7 Withholding. The Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent,
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, or Parent has
determined is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent, or Parent such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent, or Parent, as the case may be.   2.8
Transfer Taxes. If payment of the Offer Price payable to a holder of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

Option and the consummation of the Transactions have each been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
subject only to the approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger by the Company\'s stockholders. Each of this Agreement and the
Purchaser Option has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by
Parent and Purchaser, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the effect, if any, of
(i) any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or
other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally, and
(ii) general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability
is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.   3.4 Board Approvals.
The Company Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has
unanimously (a) determined that each of this Agreement, the Purchaser Option,

corporate action required to be taken by the Company Board of Directors to
authorize the consummation of the Transactions, (c) recommended that the
holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant

and recommended that, following the Offer, the stockholders of the Company
approve and adopt this Agreement and each of the Transactions, and none of
the aforesaid actions by the Company Board of Directors has been amended,
rescinded or modified. The action taken by the Company Board of Directors
constitutes approval of the Transactions (including each of the Offer and the
Merger) by the Company Board of Directors under Section 203 of the DGCL, and
no other state takeover statute is applicable to the Transactions.   3.5
Required Vote. Assuming the accuracy of Parent\'s representations set forth
in Section 4.7, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Shares (including the Series B Preferred Stock voting on
an as-converted basis) is the only vote of the holders of any class or series

Plans and related material plan documents (including trust
documents, insurance policies or contracts, employee booklets, summary plan
descriptions and other authorizing documents, and any material employee
communications relating thereto) and has, with respect to each Company
Employee Plan which is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided
copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three (3) plan years. Any
Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable determination letter as to
its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code
effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, or has applied to the IRS for such a
determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period under
applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for
such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination or has been established under a standardized
prototype plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained by the plan
sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. The Company has also
delivered to Parent the most recent IRS determination, notification,
advisory, or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee
Plan, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, nothing has occurred since the
issuance of each such letter which could reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of the tax-qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Code
Section 401(a).   (c) There has been no "prohibited transaction," as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with
respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been
administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), except as would not be reasonably expected to
have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and the
Company and each of its subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates have performed all
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in any material
respect in default under or violation of, and have no     
27  knowledge of any material default or violation by any other party to,
any of the Company Employee Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates is subject to any liability or penalty under
Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or ERISA with respect to any of the
Company Employee Plans. All contributions and premiums required to be made by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates to any Company
Employee Plan have been made on or before their due dates. Each Company
Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued in
accordance with its terms. With respect to each Company Employee Plan subject
to ERISA as either an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA, the Company has prepared in good faith and timely
filed all requisite material governmental reports (which, to the Company\'s
knowledge, were true and correct as of the date filed) and has properly and
timely filed and distributed or posted all material notices and reports to
employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each
such Company Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action
or other litigation has been brought, or to the best knowledge of the Company
is threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan,
including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or
United States Department of Labor other than routine claims for benefits.  
(d) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company, each
Company subsidiary and their respective ERISA Affiliates have complied with
(i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the
regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, (ii) the applicable
requirements of the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations
thereunder, and (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations (including
proposed regulations) thereunder, except where the failure to comply with the
applicable requirements of such laws and regulations would not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (e) The
consummation of the Transactions will not (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliates to severance benefits or any other payment, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii) except as disclosed in Section
3.17(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of Company Options, or increase the amount of compensation due
any such employee, director or consultant.   (f) No amounts payable under
any of the Company Employee Plans or any other contract, agreement or
arrangement with respect to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries may
have any liability could fail to be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. None of the
Company Employee Plans contains any provision requiring a gross-up pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code or similar tax provisions.   (g) No Company
Employee Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees of the Company, its subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate after
retirement or other termination of service (other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable laws, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any
"employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2)
of     28  ERISA, or (iii) benefits, the full direct cost of which is
borne by the current or former employee (or beneficiary thereof)).   (h)
There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in participation
or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan which would increase the expense
of maintaining such Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to
that Plan for the most recent fiscal quarter included in the Company
Financials.   (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes
to, nor have they ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in,
or contributed to, any employee pension benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.   (j) Neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or
has ever made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation to
contribute to, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA.   (k) Section 3.17(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
for each Company Option, where applicable, the performance targets, design
wins, thresholds or other measurement pursuant to which vesting or exercise
of such option is contingent.   3.18 Certain Agreements Affected by the
Merger. Except as disclosed in Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Transactions will (a) result in any payment (including, without
limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due to any officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, (b) materially increase any benefits under the
Company Employee Plans or (c) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefits. No payment which will or may be made
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any employee will be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.   3.19 Employee Matters.   (a) There are no
actions, suits, claims, charges, labor disputes, grievances or controversies
pending, or to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened involving the Company or
any of its subsidiaries and any of their respective employees or former
employees. To the Company\'s knowledge, no Governmental Entity responsible
for the enforcement of labor or employment laws intends to conduct an
investigation with respect to or relating to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and no such investigation is in progress. To the
Company\'s knowledge, no employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
has violated any employment contract, nondisclosure agreement or
noncompetition agreement by which such employee is bound due to such employee
being employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and disclosing to
the Company or any such subsidiary or using Trade Secrets of any other
person. There has been: (i) no labor union organizing or attempting to
organize any employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries into one or
more collective bargaining units; and (ii) no labor     29  dispute,

any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective
bargaining agreements or other agreement with any labor organization
applicable to the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and no
such agreement is currently being negotiated.   (b) Each of the Company and

applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and

(c) To the Company\'s knowledge, no employee of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law
enforcement agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any
crime or the violation or possible violation of any applicable law involving
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of
the Company or any such subsidiary of the Company has discharged, demoted,
suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against
an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the terms and
conditions of employment because of any act of such employee described in 18
U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).   (d) Since June 30, 2000, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" as defined in

any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of
employment or facility of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; nor has the
Company or any of its subsidiaries been affected by any transaction or

application of any state, local or foreign law or regulation similar to the
WARN Act. To the Company\'s knowledge, neither the Company\'s nor any of its
subsidiaries\' employees has suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in the
WARN Act) in the ninety (90) days prior to the date of this Agreement.  
(e) Section 3.19(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true
and complete list of (i) the names of all directors and elected and
appointed officers of each of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with
such person\'s position or function, annual base salary and incentives or
bonus arrangement, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
owned beneficially or of record, or both, by each such person and the
family relationships, if any, among such persons. As of the date hereof, no
key employee, director or officer of the     30  Company or any of its
subsidiaries has given notice to the Company, nor, except as provided in
Section 6.7, is the Company otherwise aware of any information that would
lead it to reasonably believe, that any such person will or may cease to be
engaged by the Company or applicable subsidiary of the Company for any reason
prior to the Effective Time.   3.20 Potential Conflict of Interest. Except
as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as
disclosed in Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Letter, since December
31, 2002, there have been no transactions, agreements, arrangements or
understandings between the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, on the
one hand, and their respective affiliates, on the other hand, that would be
required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to
the date hereof, no officer of the Company or any Company subsidiary owns,
directly or indirectly, any interest in (excepting not more than one percent
(1%) stock holdings for investment purposes in securities of publicly-held
and traded companies) or is an officer, director, employee or consultant of
any person which is a competitor, lessor, lessee, customer or supplier of the
Company; and no officer or director of the Company or any Company subsidiary

any commission, fee or other amount to, or to purchase or obtain or
otherwise contract to purchase or obtain any goods or services from, any

subsidiary, or, to the Company\'s knowledge, a relative of any of the
foregoing, is a partner or stockholder (except stock holdings solely for
investment purposes in securities of publicly held and traded companies) or
(d) owes any money to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (except for
reimbursement of advances in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice).   3.21 Insurance. The Company and each of its subsidiaries
has policies of insurance and bonds of the type and in amounts customarily

the Company and each of its subsidiaries. Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains an accurate summary of the material terms of all
material policies of fire, liability, workmen\'s compensation, director and
officer and other forms of insurance owned or held by the Company. All such
policies and other forms of insurance are in full force and effect, all
premiums with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the
date of the Closing have been paid, and no notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any such policy or other form
of insurance. There is no material claim pending under any such policies as
to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by any underwriter
of such policies or other forms of insurance. Such policies or other forms of
insurance are sufficient for compliance with all requirements of law and of
all agreements to which the Company is a party, are valid, outstanding and
enforceable, provide adequate insurance coverage for the normal risks
incident to the business of the Company and its assets, will remain in full
force and effect through the respective dates set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter without the payment of additional premiums (other
than existing policy premiums payable in installments), and will not in any
way be affected by, or terminate or lapse     31  by reason of, the
Transactions. Section 3.21 of Company Disclosure Letter identifies all risks
which the Company, its Board of Directors or officers have designated as
being self insured (other than applicable deductibles or retentions). The
Company has not been refused any insurance with respect to its assets or
operations, nor has its coverage been limited, by any insurance carrier to
which it has applied for any such insurance or with which it has carried
insurance during the last two years.   3.22 Compliance With Laws. The
Company and its subsidiaries have complied in a timely manner and in all
material respects with all laws, rules and regulations, ordinances,
judgments, decrees, orders, writs and injunctions of all United States
federal, state, local, foreign governments and agencies thereof which affect
the business, properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
except for instances of possible noncompliance that individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and no notice, charge, claim, action or assertion has been
received by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or has been
filed, commenced or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries alleging any violation of any of the
foregoing, except for instances of possible noncompliance that individually
or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. All licenses, permits and approvals required
under such laws, rules and regulations are in full force and effect except
where the failure to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   3.23 Minute
Books. The minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries made available to

and stockholders or actions by written consent from October 1, 1999 through

Company\'s gross revenues during the 12-month period preceding the date
hereof, and no single supplier of the Company or its subsidiaries, has
canceled or otherwise terminated, or has advised the Company that it intends
to cancel or otherwise terminate, its relationship with the Company or its
subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Section 3.26 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no single customer which individually accounted for more than 4% of

Company or its subsidiaries or advised the Company that it intends to
decrease materially its use of the services or products of the Company and

its subsidiaries.   3.27 Material Contracts. Section 3.27 of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of (i) all material
contracts, agreements, indemnities, guarantees, notes, bonds, mortgages,

copies of all such material Company Agreements have been delivered to Parent.
Each Company Agreement that is required to be listed in Section 3.27 of the
Company Disclosure Letter is valid, binding and enforceable and is in full
force and effect and there are no defaults, events of default or, to
the knowledge of the Company, allegations of default thereunder. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries has in all material respects performed the
obligations required to be performed by it and is entitled to the benefits
under each Company Agreement except such benefits as that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.   3.28 Third Party Consents. Section 3.28 of
the Company Disclosure Letter lists all Company Agreements that require
notices, authorizations, consents or approvals that are necessary for the
consummation by the Company of any of the Transactions and identifies each
Company Agreement which, if no notice is given or no authorization, consent
or approval is obtained, would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent\'s ability to operate the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries in the same manner as the business was operated by the
Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.   3.29 Product
Releases. The Company has provided Parent a schedule of product releases,
which schedule is attached as Section 3.29 of the Company Disclosure Letter.
The Company has a good faith reasonable belief that it can achieve the
release of products on the schedule described in Section 3.29 of the Company
Disclosure Letter and is not currently aware of any change in
its circumstances or other fact that has occurred that would cause it to
believe that it will be unable to meet such release schedule.   3.30
Company Design Wins. Section 3.30 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true and complete list of design wins by the Company or any of
its subsidiaries as of the date of the this Agreement, whether publicly
disclosed or not, specifying for each design win, the name of the customer
and the relevant product or products. As of the date of this Agreement, for
each design win listed in Section 3.30 of the Company Disclosure Letter: (i)
neither the Company nor     33  any of its subsidiaries has any reason
to believe that the relevant product or products will not be developed and
issued for production, and (ii) no customer listed on Section 3.30 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule has canceled or otherwise terminated, or has
advised the Company that such customer intends to cancel or otherwise
terminate, the design win relating to such customer.   3.31 Orders,
Commitments and Returns. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
claims against the Company to return in excess of an aggregate of $300,000 of
merchandise by reason of alleged overshipments, defective merchandise or
otherwise, or of merchandise in the hands of customers under an understanding
that such merchandise would be returnable.   3.32 Support, Maintenance and
Warranty Obligations. Section 3.32 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as of September 28, 2003, the approximate installed base of the
Company\'s products, the key customers that have purchased the products and
the warranty reserves for warranty obligations of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of September 28, 2003.   3.33 Inventory. The inventories
shown on the Company Financials or thereafter acquired by the Company,
consisted of items of a quantity and quality usable or salable in the
ordinary course of business (other than slow-moving, obsolete or unusable
items which are adequately reserved for in the Company Financials to reflect
realizable value). Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has continued to
replenish inventories in a normal and customary manner consistent with past
practices. The Company has not received written or oral notice that it will
experience in the foreseeable future any material difficulty in obtaining, in
the desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable price and upon
reasonable terms and conditions, the raw materials, supplies or
component products required for the manufacture, assembly or production of
its products. The values at which inventories are carried reflect the
inventory valuation policy of the Company, which is consistent with its past
practice and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a consistent basis. Since the Balance Sheet Date, due provision
was made on the books of the Company in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices, to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or
unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values and such
inventory reserves are adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or
unusable inventory and inventory shrinkage. As of September 28, 2003, the
aggregate value of the inventory of the Company in the distribution channel
does not exceed the average aggregate value of the inventory of the Company
in the distribution channel over the past four quarters.   3.34 Accounts
Receivable. Subject to any reserves set forth in the Company Financials, the
accounts receivable shown in the Company Financials represent bona fide
claims against debtors for sales and other charges, and are not subject to
discount except for normal cash and immaterial trade discounts. The amount
carried for doubtful accounts and allowances disclosed in the
Company Financials is reasonably adequate and consistent with the Company\'s
past practice.   3.35 Information in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement, if any (and any amendment thereof and supplement thereto), at the
date mailed to the Company\'s stockholders and at the time of any meeting of
Company stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the     34  circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to statements made therein based on information supplied
in writing by Parent or Purchaser expressly for inclusion in the Proxy

provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.  
3.36 Information in the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9.

incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will

statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and, on
the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published or sent or given
to the Company\'s stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to

Parent or Purchaser expressly for inclusion therein.   3.37 Opinion of
Financial Advisor. The Company has received the written opinion of Goldman,
Sachs and Co. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
consideration to be received by the holders of the Company\'s Common Stock in
the Offer and the Merger was fair from a financial point of view to such
stockholders.   3.38 Personnel. Section 3.38 of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth a true and complete list of (a) the names and current
salaries of all directors and elected and appointed officers of each of the

Agreement and have taken and will maintain in effect all further necessary
action (a) to prevent any Right issued or issuable under the Rights Agreement
from becoming exercisable by virtue of this Agreement, the Purchaser Option,

Company and its Representatives (as defined below) has ceased and caused to
be terminated all existing solicitations, initiations, encouragements,
discussions, negotiations and communications with any persons or entities
with respect to any offer or proposal relating to any transaction or series
of related transactions other than the Transactions involving: (i) any
acquisition or purchase from the Company by any person or group (as defined
in Section 9.4(c)) of more than a fifteen percent (15%) interest in the total
outstanding voting securities of the Company or any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any person or group beneficially
owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of the Company; (ii) any merger, consolidation,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company; (iii) any
sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of more
than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the Company; or (iv) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation or dissolution of the Company
(each, an "Acquisition Proposal"). Except as provided in Section 5.2(b), from
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of termination of this Agreement
or the Effective Time, the Company shall not and shall not authorize or
permit its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants or other agents or those of its subsidiaries (collectively,
"Representatives") to directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any action (other than the issuance of
the joint press release under Section 6.2 or filings with the SEC permitted
by this Agreement), to facilitate the making of, any offer or proposal which
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with the terms of
Section 5.2(b)), (iii) in the event of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
for the Company, engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any
non-public information or data to, any person or group (other than Parent or
any of its affiliates or representatives) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or other
agreement. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the
Company\'s Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so
authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act
on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a material
breach of this Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or any other provision hereof shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders its position with respect to any
tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) making such disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders (including
withdrawing or modifying, in a manner adverse to the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the approval or recommendation by the Company
Board of Directors or any committee thereof in favor of the Offer, this
Agreement or the Merger) as in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
of Directors, only after receipt of advice from outside legal counsel to the
Company that such disclosure is required under applicable law and that the
failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to cause the Company
Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the Company
\'s stockholders under applicable law, is required.   (b) Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to the
acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company may furnish non-
public information to any person or group pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less    42  favorable to the Company than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement, dated September 2, 2003, entered
into between Parent and the Company (as amended through the date hereof, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such person or group concerning an
Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, (i) (x) such Acquisition
Proposal provides for consideration to be received by the holders of all, but
not less than all, of the issued and outstanding Shares (a "Takeover
Proposal"); (y) such person or group has on an unsolicited basis, and in the
absence of any violation of this Section 5.2 by the Company or its
Representatives, submitted a bona fide written proposal to the Company
relating to any such Takeover Proposal which at least a majority of the full
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving
advice from a nationally recognized investment banking firm and its outside
legal counsel, involves consideration to the holders of the Shares that is,
or is reasonably likely to lead to a proposal that is, more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Company\'s stockholders than the consideration
offered pursuant to the Offer, is reasonably capable of being completed and
which is not conditioned upon obtaining additional financing, in each case
taking into account, among other things, conditions to consummation, required
regulatory approvals and the fees payable to Parent hereunder, and (z) in the
good faith opinion of the Company Board of Directors, only after consultation
with outside legal counsel to the Company, providing such information or
access or engaging in such discussions or negotiations is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders and the failure to provide such
information or access or to engage in such discussions or negotiations would
cause the Company Board of Directors to violate its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s stockholders under applicable law (a Takeover Proposal which
satisfies clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred to herein as a "Superior
Proposal"). The Company shall promptly, and in any event within forty-eight
(48) hours following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, and prior to
providing any person or group with any material non-public
information, notify Parent orally and in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall disclose the identity of the other party and the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly, and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following a determination by the
Company Board of Directors that a Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such
determination. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-
public information regarding the Company provided to any other person or
group which was not previously provided to Parent, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other person or group.   (c) Except as set forth in
this Section 5.2, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent or
Purchaser, the approval, or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors
or any committee thereof in favor of the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger,
(ii) approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal of any person or group other than Parent and Purchaser or (iii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal of any
person or group other than Parent and Purchaser (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with the terms of Section 5.2(b)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, prior
to the time of acceptance for payment of Shares in the Offer, the Company
Board of Directors may (subject to the terms of this and the following
sentence) withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation in favor of the
Offer, this Agreement or the Merger, approve or recommend a   
43  Superior Proposal, or enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal (and make any amendments to the Rights Agreement necessary
thereto), in each case, only after the third business day following the
Company\'s delivery to Parent of written notice advising Parent that the
Company Board of Directors has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifying the
person or group making such Superior Proposal and advising Parent that the
Company intends to approve or recommend a Superior Proposal or enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (specifying which course of
action the Company intends to take); provided, however, that the Company
shall not enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal unless
the Company shall also terminate this Agreement in compliance with Section
5.2(d). Any such withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation of
the Company Board of Directors, the approval or recommendation or proposed
approval or recommendation of any Superior Proposal or the entry by the
Company into any agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal shall not
change the approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the
Transactions.   (d) The Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into
an acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to
Section 8.1(g) at any time three (3) business days following delivery of the
notice referenced in Section 5.2(c); provided, that (i) neither the Company
nor its Representatives is in material breach of this Section 5.2, (ii)
during the three (3) business day period following the Company\'s delivery to
Parent of the written notice described in Section 5.2(c), Parent shall have
the right to propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Company shall have caused its financial and legal advisors
to negotiate with Parent in good faith such proposed adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) upon the expiration of the three
(3) business day period following the Company\'s delivery to Parent of the
written notice described in Section 5.2(c), the Company delivers to Parent
(x) a written notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.2(d), and (y) pays the Termination Fee (as defined in Section
8.2(b)) plus the Expense Fee (as defined in Section 8.2(b)), as the same may
have been estimated by Parent in good faith prior to the date of
such delivery (subject to the limitations of Section 8.2(b) and to an
adjustment payment between the parties upon Parent\'s definitive
determination of such expenses) as set forth in Section 8.2.   ARTICLE
VI   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   6.1 Confidentiality; Access to
Information.   (a) The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent
have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement. Unless otherwise
required by law or regulation (including Nasdaq or NYSE rules) or pursuant to
the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or this Agreement,
Parent and the Purchaser will hold any information which is non-public in
confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and,
in the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, Parent or the
Purchaser shall promptly return or destroy such information in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.    44  The Company will afford
Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
to the properties, books, analysis, projections, plans, systems, contracts,
commitments, records, personnel offices and other facilities of the Company
and its subsidiaries during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain
all information concerning the business, including the status of product
development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company and use all reasonable efforts to make available at all
reasonable times during normal business hours to Parent and its
Representatives, the appropriate individuals (including management personnel,
attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for discussion of the
Company\'s business, properties, prospects and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. The Company agrees to provide its consent and to execute
suitable confidentiality agreements allowing the Company\'s third party
suppliers, strategic partners and customers to meet with and hold discussions
with representatives of Parent. During such period, the Company shall (and
shall cause each of the Company\'s subsidiaries to), subject to any
limitations imposed by law with respect to records of employees, furnish
promptly to Parent and the Purchaser (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent
or the Purchaser may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained
by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.1 will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties (and each
employee, representative or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the transactions contemplated hereby beginning on the earliest
of (i) the date of the public announcement by the parties of discussions
relating to the Transactions, (ii) the date of public announcement by the
parties of the Transactions hereby or (iii) the date of the execution of this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.1(b) shall
permit either party (or any employee, representative or agent thereof) to
disclose (i) any information that is not necessary to understand the tax
treatment and tax structure of such transactions (including the identity of
the parties and any information that could lead another to determine the
identity of the parties) or (ii) any other information to the extent that
such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or state
securities law.   6.2 Public Disclosure. The initial press release
concerning the Offer and the Merger shall be a joint press release and,
thereafter, neither Parent, Purchaser nor the Company will disseminate any
press release or other announcement concerning the Merger, the Offer or this
Agreement or the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any
third party or to the employees of the Company without the prior written
consent of each of the other parties hereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the Company and Parent may
file a copy of this Agreement and the related agreements as exhibits to a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed in connection with the announcement of this
Agreement. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement.   6.3 Reasonable Efforts;
Notification.    45   (a) Subject to the express provisions of Section
5.2 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including
complying in all material respects with all applicable laws and with all
rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity, using all reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts
necessary to cause the Minimum Condition and all the conditions set forth in
Article VII and in Annex I hereto to be satisfied and to consummate and make
effective the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
(including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims,
actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed if there is a reasonable
possibility that defending such actions would result in their dismissal,
removal, elimination or termination, and (v) the execution or delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions, and to carry
out fully the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other Transactions,
use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the
other Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent,
Purchaser or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to take or agree to take any
Action of Divestiture (as defined below) which would be reasonably expected
either to materially and adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived
by Parent as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries
as currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted on a combined basis
with the business of Parent and its subsidiaries following the Merger. For
purposes of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean (i) making
proposals, executing or carrying out agreements or submitting to any
applicable federal, state, local, municipal, foreign or other law, statute,
constitution, principle of common law, resolution, ordinance, code, order,
judgment, edict, decree, rule, regulation, ruling or requirement issued,
enacted, adopted, promulgated, implemented or otherwise put into effect by or
under the authority of any Governmental Entity (a "Legal Requirement")
providing for the license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent, any of its affiliates or the Company or the
holding separate of the shares of Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or
imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries or affiliates to conduct their business or own such
assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the   
46  shares of the Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or (ii) otherwise
taking any step to avoid or eliminate any impediment which may be asserted
under any Legal Requirement governing competition, monopolies or restrictive
trade practices. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary
actions.   (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i)
any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement that is
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof
to the Effective Time (ii) any condition set forth in Annex I that is
unsatisfied in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the
date the Purchaser purchases Shares pursuant to the Offer (except to the
extent it refers to a specific date), (iii) any change or event having or
which could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iv) any material failure of the
Company or any Representative to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or the
Purchaser Option.   6.4 Indemnification.   (a) For a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant
to any indemnification agreements, dated prior to the date hereof and set
forth in Section 6.4(a) the Company Disclosure Letter, between the Company
and its present and former directors and officers (the "Indemnified Parties")
and any indemnification provisions under the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof,
which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.  
(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will, at
its election, either (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect, if
available, directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those
persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable
to the directors and officers of the Company or (ii) obtain, or permit the
Company to obtain, a six (6) year "tail" insurance policy that provides
coverage substantially similar to the coverage provided under the Company\'s
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable to the directors and
officers of the Company; provided, however, that in no event will the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of one hundred twenty-
five percent (125%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such coverage (the "Current Annual Premium Amount") (or such coverage as is
available for such one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of    
47  such annual premium). The Current Annual Premium Amount is set forth on
Section 6.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (c) This Section 6.4
shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and each indemnified party, shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties.   6.5
Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense of any litigation (other than where the Parent or Purchaser is an
adverse party) against the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and/or any
of their respective directors relating to the Transactions.   6.6 Interim
Directors. Pursuant to Section 1.3(b), the Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause a sufficient number of its current directors to continue as
Independent Directors of the Company until the Effective Time.   6.7
Resignation of Directors. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause each member of its Board of Directors and every member of the Board of
Directors of each subsidiary of the Company not designated by Parent
pursuant to Section 1.3, to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or
her voluntary resignation as a director of the Board of Directors of the
Company and each of its subsidiaries effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   6.8 Rights Agreement. The Company has amended the Rights
Agreement and shall take such further action as may be necessary under the
Rights Agreement to render the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser Option, the
Stockholder Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and any other Transaction. As
soon as practicable on or after the date hereof, but in any event no later
than two (2) business days, the Company shall register the Rights on Form 8-A
and list the Rights for trading on the Nasdaq.   6.9 Benefit Plans. Parent
shall, from and after the Effective Time, (i) until such time as employees of
the Company are covered by or participating in Parent\'s medical, dental,
life and short- and long-term disability insurance and 401(k) plans, comply
with the Company\'s medical, dental, life, short- and long-term disability
insurance and 401(k) plans in accordance with their terms to the extent not
inconsistent with applicable law, (ii) provide employees of the Company who
remain as employees of the Surviving Corporation with employee benefit plans
which are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent, (iii) provide employees of the Company who
remain as employees of the Surviving Corporation credit for years of service
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
the purpose of eligibility and vesting pursuant to Parent\'s plans
and policies (but not for accrual of benefits to the extent that such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits), and (iv) cause any and all pre-
existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply
to a pre-existing condition under comparable Company Employee Plans) and
eligibility waiting periods under group health plans of Parent to be waived
with respect to former employees of the Company who remain as employees of
the Surviving Corporation (and their eligible dependents) and who become
participants in similar group health plans of Parent or the   
48  Surviving Corporation. Former employees of the Company who remain as
employees of the Surviving Corporation shall also be given credit for any
deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year of Parent
in which the Effective Time occurs, to the extent, following the Effective
Time, they participate in any of Parent\'s plans during such plan year for
which deductibles or co-payments are required. Nothing in this Section 6.9
shall be interpreted as preventing Parent or its subsidiaries from amending,
modifying or terminating any Company Employee Plans, or other contracts,
arrangements, commitments or understandings.   6.10 Guarantee of
Performance. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by
Purchaser of all of its obligations under this Agreement.   ARTICLE VII

cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer to be consummated by such
date; or   (c) by Parent if the Minimum Condition shall not have been

provided, however, that Parent shall not be entitled to terminate this

such failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition; or   (d) by Parent if (i)
prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, there has been a

thereunder or (z) failed to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer

failure of either of Parent or Purchaser to perform, in any material respect,
any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or the breach
by Parent of any of its representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement; or   (e) by Parent, at any time prior to the purchase of
the Shares pursuant to the Offer, if (i) the Company Board of Directors shall
have withdrawn, modified, or changed its approval or recommendation in favor
of this Agreement or the Offer in a manner adverse to     
50    Parent or Purchaser, (ii) the Company Board of Directors or any

offer is first published, sent or given, a statement disclosing that the

offer or (iv) the Company shall have violated or breached in any material
respect any of its obligations under Section 5.2, unless there has been a
material breach by Parent or Purchaser of any representation, warranty,

have a material adverse effect on Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s ability to
consummate the Offer or the Merger; or   (f) by the Company if (i) prior to
the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer that would represent a majority
of the Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis, there has been a material breach by

contained in this Agreement except to the extent such breach, together with
all such breaches, does not and would not be likely to have a material
adverse effect on Parent\'s or Purchaser\'s ability to consummate the Offer

been satisfied within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice thereof or
such breach is not reasonably capable of being cured or such condition is not
reasonably capable of being satisfied with such period); or (ii) due to an

Shares for payment hereunder or (z) failed to accept Shares for

Agreement, or the material breach by the Company of any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement; or   (g) by the
Company pursuant to Section 5.2(d).  8.2 Effect of Termination.   (a) In
the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1,
written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no
liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company (or any of
their representatives), except (i) as set forth in this Section 8.2, Section
8.3 and Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any material breach of this Agreement.   (b) If (i) Parent shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or (ii) the Company
shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then the
Company shall pay to Parent promptly, but in no event later than two (2)

8.1(e), or immediately prior thereto or concurrent    51   therewith if
pursuant to Section 8.1(g), a termination fee of $9.3 million
(the "Termination Fee"), plus an amount equal to the actual out-of-pocket

banking fees, if any, and disbursements) incurred by Parent and Purchaser in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement up to an aggregate
amount of $1.0 million (the "Expense Fee"); provided, however, that in the
event of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i), (ii), or (iii) or 8.1(g),
one-half of the aggregate Termination Fee and Expense Fees (as the same may
have been estimated by Parent in good faith prior to the time such payment is
due, with an adjustment payment in cash upon Parent\'s definitive
determination of the Expense Fee) otherwise payable in cash may, at the
election of the Company, instead be paid pursuant to a promissory note and
security agreement in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit E, which note
shall be executed and delivered within the time periods otherwise provided
herein.   (c) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to

Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee and the Expense Fee promptly,
but in no event later than two (2) business days after the earlier of the
announcement of the Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of the
acquisition; provided, however, that one-half of the aggregate Termination
Fee and Expense Fee (as the same may have been estimated by Parent in good
faith prior to the time such payment is due, with an adjustment payment in
cash upon Parent\'s definitive determination of the Expense Fee) otherwise
payable in cash may, at the election of the Company, instead be paid pursuant
to a promissory note and security agreement in the forms attached hereto as
Exhibit E, which note shall be executed and delivered within the time periods
otherwise provided herein. For the purposes of this Section 8.2(c), the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 5.2(a),
except that the percentages set forth in such provision shall be changed to

deemed to be Acquisition Proposals.   (d) Except as provided above, the
Company shall pay the Termination Fee and the Expense Fee to Parent in cash
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account as Parent may
designate to the Company in writing.   8.3 Fees and Expenses. Except as
provided in Section 8.2, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection

related thereto) and any amendments or supplements thereto, and the filing of

parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered

conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on

events, changes, occurrences or developments that (i) is materially adverse
to the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets (including

would prevent or materially alter or delay any of the Transactions except,
for each of (i) and (ii) above, to the extent that no such   
54   event, change, occurrence or development results solely from changes
in general economic or market conditions, or from changes affecting the
industry generally in which the party operates and which do not affect such
party disproportionately; provided, that a Material Adverse Effect shall not
include an event, change, occurrence or development arising out of or
resulting from actions contemplated by the parties in connection with this

more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to
the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.   9.6 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement and the exhibits, documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including
the Company Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the provisions
of this Agreement shall supersede any conflicting provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in
Section 6.4.   9.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as    55   reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.   9.8 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except
as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   9.9 Governing Law;
Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof;
provided, however, that the laws of the respective jurisdictions
of incorporation of each of the parties shall govern the relative
rights, obligations, powers, duties and other internal affairs of such party
and its board of directors. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement or any of the Transactions; (b) agrees that it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it shall not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court
other than the Delaware Court of Chancery or a federal court sitting in the
State of Delaware.   9.10 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree
that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.   9.11 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
that the Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent
of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to (a) Parent, (b) to Parent and one or more direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent, or (c) to one or more direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent (each, an "Assignee"); provided, however,
that, to the extent required by Section 251 of the DGCL in order for this
Agreement, with such rights assigned, to be valid from and after such
assignment, such assignment shall be effective only after (a) an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement to effectuate such assignment shall have been
executed by the parties hereto and any such Assignee and (b) such amendment,
or this Agreement as so amended, shall have received all approvals required
by the DGCL. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any
party hereto of any obligation hereunder, this    56   Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.   9.12 Amendment and Modification.
Subject to applicable law and as otherwise provided in the Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action
taken by their respective Boards of Directors or equivalent governing bodies,
but, after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment shall
be made which decreases the Merger Consideration and, after the approval of
this Agreement by the stockholders, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   9.13 No Waiver. No
failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.   9.14 Waiver of
Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND PURCHASER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENT OR ACTION RELATED HERETO OR
THERETO.   [REST OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]    57      IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their duly authorized respective officers as of the date first
