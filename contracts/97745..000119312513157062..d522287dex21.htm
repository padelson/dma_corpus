iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of April 14,
2013, among Life Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and Polpis Merger Sub Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

WHEREAS the parties intend that Merger Sub, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger;

 

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) subject to Section 5.02,
resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company; and

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have (i)
determined that it is in the best interests of the stockholders of Parent and
Merger Sub, respectively, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement and (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) 

 



1  waiver of those conditions at such time). The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York
10019. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may take place at such
other date, time or place as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
merger, executed in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). At or
prior to the Closing, the parties shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time the
Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Effective Time_ ".

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ At the Effective
Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended and restated in its entirety to be in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to Section 5.07) and (b) the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law (subject to Section 5.07).

SECTION 1.06. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation._ The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the
case may be.

SECTION 1.07. _Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ The officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 



2 ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates _

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Parent or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of Stock
Owned by Company Subsidiaries._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is
owned by the Company as treasury stock (other than any share of Company Common
Stock that is held on behalf of a third party in the Company Rabbi Trust) or
that is owned by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent shall
not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall be, at
the election of Parent, either (i) converted into shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled or converted into shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and any Appraisal
Shares) shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the sum of $76.00, without
interest, and the Additional Per Share Consideration, if any (together, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock held in uncertificated book-entry form ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, to be
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.02(b), in the case of certificated shares, and
automatically in the case of Book-Entry Shares. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Additional Per Share Consideration_ " means, if the Effective
Time occurs after the nine-month anniversary of the date hereof (and the End
Date has automatically been extended pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i)) and the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or prior to such date was not caused
by the failure of the Company to perform in all material respects its
obligations under Sections 5.04(c) and 5.04(d), an amount in cash equal to
$0.0062466 for each day

 



3  during the period commencing on, and including, January 14, 2014, and ending
on, and including, the Closing Date.

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have
not voted in favor of or consented to the Merger and who are entitled to
demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be canceled and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), and
the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock and attempted withdrawals of such demands, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands for appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as
otherwise required by an Order, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands.

SECTION 2.02.  _Exchange of Shares._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and,
in connection therewith, shall prior to the Closing Date enter into an
agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement to the holders of Company
Common Stock, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States
of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit
of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by each of Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poors
Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10
billion. Parent shall promptly replace or cause to be replaced any
funds deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made
pursuant to this Section 2.02(a). The Paying Agent shall be required to hold
the Exchange Fund for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock, and to
promptly make the payments provided for in this Article II. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose not expressly provided for in this
Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 2.02(a) and no investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein.

(b) _Payment Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three Business Days thereafter), the
Surviving

 



4  Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each registered holder
of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificate in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with the associated
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
such letters instructions (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate
shall, subject to Section 2.01(d), be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. The aggregate Merger Consideration payable in
respect of each Certificate shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest.
Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article II. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry
Shares shall, subject to Section 2.01(d), automatically upon the Effective
Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three Business Days thereafter), the
Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share. The aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to a holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, it shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



5 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority), any Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay and deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate.

(g) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state or local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock, Options or RSUs or to Share Equivalent Unit Holders in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

SECTION 2.03. _Company Equity Awards._ (a) At or prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take such actions as are necessary (including obtaining any
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans, including the
Company Deferred Compensation Plan) to provide that:

(i) subject to Section 2.02(g) and except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder thereof, each unexercised option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan (each,

 



6  an " _Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be
canceled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(ii) subject to Section 2.02(g) and except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder thereof, each restricted stock unit award, or portion thereof,
granted under a Company Stock Plan that vests based solely on the continued
service of the holder of such award, that is payable in shares of Company
Common Stock or whose value is determined with reference to the value of
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Time-Based RSU_ "), and is not
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that would otherwise vest in accordance with its terms (without
regard to the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable
award agreement)) prior to January 1, 2015 shall, as of the Effective Time, be
deemed to be fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be canceled, with
the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Time-Based RSU that would
vest prior to January 1, 2015;

(iii) subject to Section 2.02(g) and except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder thereof, each restricted stock unit award granted under a Company
Stock Plan that is subject to performance-based vesting and is payable in
shares of Company Common Stock or the value of which is determined with
reference to the value of shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Performance-Based RSU_ " and, together with Time-Based RSUs, " _RSUs_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, be deemed to be fully vested and nonforfeitable at the level
determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity award
agreement and shall be canceled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Performance-Based RSU determined in accordance with the terms
of the applicable equity award agreement relating to such RSU;

(iv) subject to Section 2.02(g) and except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder thereof, each Time-Based RSU, or portion thereof, that is not
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that would vest in
accordance with its terms (without regard to the occurrence of a Change in
Control (as defined in the applicable award agreement)) on or after January 1,
2015 shall, as of the Effective Time, be assumed by Parent and converted into
an 

 



7  award (" _Assumed Time-Based RSU_ ") representing a right to receive a cash
amount equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration (the " _Assumed
RSU Merger Consideration_ ") multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Time-Based RSU that would have been
delivered to the holder in connection with each vesting date of such Time-
Based RSU that occurs on or after January 1, 2015. Such Assumed Time-Based
RSU shall continue to vest and be settled in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan and of the award agreements evidencing the
corresponding Time-Based RSU as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to accelerated vesting and settlement upon
termination of employment (including, for the avoidance of doubt, after a
Change in Control));

 

(v) subject to Section 2.02(g) and except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder thereof, each Time-Based RSU, or portion thereof, that is
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, be assumed by Parent and converted into an Assumed Time-Based
RSU representing a right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (A)
the Assumed RSU Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Time-Based RSU that would have vested or
been settled on each vesting date of such Time-Based RSU that occurs after the
Effective Time. Such Assumed Time-Based RSU shall continue to vest and/or be
settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and
of the award agreements evidencing the corresponding Time-Based RSU as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to
accelerated vesting and settlement upon termination of employment (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, after a Change in Control)); and

(vi) subject to Section 2.02(g) and except as otherwise agreed by Parent and
the holder thereof, each stock unit credited to the account of any participant
in the Company Deferred Compensation Plan that is payable in shares of Company
Common Stock or whose value is determined with reference to the value of
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Share Equivalent Unit_ ", and each

transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with Parent and Merger Sub
with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, modification,
cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of any benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon, any of the properties or
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i) the certificate of

declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required by or with

Antitrust Law, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (iii) such other consents,

other transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its
Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained
in this Agreement is intended to give the Company, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation._ (a) The Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, (i) immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any persons with respect to a Takeover
Proposal that existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) from
the date hereof until the Effective Time, not, directly or indirectly, (A)
initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage the making of any
Takeover Proposal or (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person
any non-public information in connection with a Takeover Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5.02(a) or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time after the date
hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or
any of its Representatives receives a written Takeover Proposal, which
Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02, (i)
the Company and its Representatives may contact such person or group of
persons making the Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and the failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company and its Representatives may (x) enter into an

 



31  Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the person or group of persons
making the Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant thereto information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person or group of persons who has made such Takeover
Proposal and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person or group of persons making such Takeover
Proposal. In the event that, pursuant to clause (x) of the foregoing
sentence, the Company furnishes to a person or group of persons making a
Takeover Proposal any material non-public information concerning the Company
or its Subsidiaries that has not previously been furnished or made available
to Parent or its Representatives, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) furnish such information to Parent. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date
hereof that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that such confidentiality agreement need not include a standstill provision.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after
receipt) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal,
which notice shall include the identity of the person or group of persons
making such Takeover Proposal and a copy of the Takeover Proposal, and the
Company shall, upon the request of Parent, keep Parent reasonably informed of
any material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal
(including any material changes thereto, and including by providing copies of
any materially revised or material new documents evidencing or delivered in
connection with such Takeover Proposal). The Company represents and agrees
that it and its Subsidiaries have not entered into, and will not, after the
date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
person that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this Section 5.02.

 

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.02(d), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold or
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to
withhold or withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company
Board Recommendation, (B) make any public statement that is inconsistent with
the Company Board Recommendation (including by failing to recommend against
any Takeover Proposal structured as a tender or exchange offer within ten
Business Days after commencement of such offer) or (C) approve or adopt,
or recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly propose to recommend,
approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ", it
being understood that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not, in and of itself,
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change) or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered
into in accordance with Section 5.02(b) (each, a " _Company_  

 



32   _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company and
any committee thereof may (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (2) cause the
Company to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
a Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach
of this Section 5.02 and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii), if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company or a
committee thereof, as applicable, shall not, and shall cause the Company not
to, take any action set forth in clause (1) or clause (2) unless (A) the
Company has given Parent at least five calendar days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the reasons
therefor and, if relating to a Takeover Proposal, include an unredacted copy
of any such Superior Proposal and an unredacted copy of any relevant proposed
transaction agreements and specify the identity of the person or group of
persons making such Superior Proposal), (B) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable
Parent to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms
of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal (or, if the action set forth in clause (1) does
not relate to a Takeover Proposal, such that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law) and (C) following the end of such notice period,
the Board of Directors of the Company has considered in good faith such
binding offer, and has determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal (or, if the action set forth in clause (1) does
not relate to a Takeover Proposal, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law) if the revisions proposed in such
binding offer were to be given effect. Without limiting other covenants under
this Section 5.02, after complying with the foregoing proviso with respect to
any Superior Proposal (x) the Company shall have no further obligations under
such proviso with respect to such Superior Proposal (including with respect
to any revisions or changes thereto), and (y) the Board of Directors of the
Company or a committee thereof, as applicable, shall not be required to comply
with such obligations with respect to such Superior Proposal (including with
respect to any revisions or changes thereto).

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is
required by applicable Law; 

 



33   _provided_ , _however_ , that neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) will in
any way eliminate or modify the effect that any such action would otherwise
have under this Agreement. 

(f) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or group of persons (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to (i) any direct or indirect
acquisition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, of 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based
on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company), including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Subsidiaries of the Company whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company), (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the outstanding Company
Common Stock or voting power of the Company, (iii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group of
persons beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common
Stock or voting power of the Company or (iv) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company, pursuant to which such person or
group of persons (or the stockholders of any person) would acquire, directly
or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of
the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct
or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity, in each case,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) is reasonably capable of
being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all material
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all
material conditions contained therein and (y) to be more favorable from
a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than the transactions
contemplated hereby (taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such Takeover Proposal); _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in
the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

SECTION 5.03. _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting._
(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the
SEC. Subject to Section 5.02, the Board of Directors of the Company shall make
the Company Board Recommendation to the Companys stockholders and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to
the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates as may be reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and cooperate
with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy

 



34  Statement and the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply Parent with copies of
all written correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC
concerning the Proxy Statement and to resolve such comments with the SEC, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the resolution of any such comments. Prior to the filing of the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to
any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response, which the Company shall consider in good faith.

(b) Subject to Section 5.03(a), and notwithstanding any Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall take all necessary actions in
accordance with applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws
and the rules of NASDAQ to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement, and, prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, shall not submit any Takeover Proposal for approval
or adoption by the stockholders of the Company. Subject to Section 5.02, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or
(ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting.

SECTION 5.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts._  (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with
the other parties and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any
action, another standard of performance is expressly provided for herein) to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to

 



35  Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation
to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,

documents, (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers,
permits, authorizations, orders and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) defend or contest in good
faith any Action brought by a third party that could otherwise prevent or

of each of clauses (i) through (iv), other than with respect to filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents, approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, which are
the subject of Sections 5.04(c) and 5.04(d).

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company
and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and refrain from taking any
actions that would cause the applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the
restrictions of any Takeover Law become applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, (ii) supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law and (iii) take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws and to
obtain all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any
Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the
parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each party hereto shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to
resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law,
including (A) defending any Actions challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed), (B) executing settlements,
undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other

 



36  agreements with any Governmental Authority or with any other person, (C)
selling, divesting, conveying or holding separate or otherwise taking any
other action that limits Parents and its Subsidiaries freedom of action
with respect to, or their ability to retain, particular products, assets or
businesses of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, or
agreeing to take any such action, (D) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries and (E) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, in each case, to the
extent necessary to obtain all consents that may be required under the HSR Act
or any other applicable Antitrust Laws or to resolve any objections asserted
by any Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that it is expressly understood and agreed that nothing in this
Agreement, including any provision of this Section 5.04, shall be deemed to
require Parent (or permit the Company, without Parents prior written consent)
to take, or agree or commit to take, any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, involving the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 5.04 or otherwise in connection with obtaining the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or any other applicable Antitrust Laws or any consents under any Antitrust
Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority with competent
jurisdiction, that would, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on Parent, or on the
Company and its Subsidiaries (for the avoidance of doubt, including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), in each case
measured on a scale relative to the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Nothing in this Section 5.04 shall require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing, or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to take or agree to any action or other matter pursuant to this Section 5.04
referred to in clauses (B)-(E) above without Parents prior written consent
(which consent shall be granted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence), including that (but without limiting Parents obligations pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence) if any products, businesses or assets
of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries are to be sold,
divested or disposed of pursuant to this Section 5.04, Parent shall have the
right to select the products, businesses and/or assets to be sold, divested
or disposed of.

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with
a Governmental Authority by any person in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with the other
parties

 



37  hereto with respect to information relating to the other parties hereto and
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority, or
in any filings or submissions in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than documents submitted under Item 4(c) or 4(d) of the Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act, and (iv) to the extent practicable
and permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental
Authority or private party, as the case may be, give the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in any meetings and
conferences.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, provide all cooperation that is necessary, customary or
advisable and reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in
the arrangement of any third party debt or equity financing for the purpose
of financing the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Equity Award
Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this
Agreement or required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of
Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Financing_ ") (it being understood that the
receipt of such Financing is not a condition to the Merger); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to agree to pay any fees, reimburse any expenses or otherwise
incur any liability or give any indemnities prior to the Effective Time for
which it is not promptly reimbursed or simultaneously indemnified or (C)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the
Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, any applicable Laws, the Credit
Agreement or any Material Contract. Such cooperation shall include,
without limitation, (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations and due diligence sessions, (ii) providing reasonable and timely
assistance with the preparation of materials for presentations, offering
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practical, and in any event at
least 10 days prior to the Closing Date, furnishing Parent and its financing
sources with (i) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements
of operations and comprehensive income and cash flows for the Company for the
fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2013 and each subsequent fiscal quarter ended
on a date that is not a fiscal year end and that is at least 45 days before
the Closing Date and (ii) (in the event that the Closing Date occurs on a date
that is more than 90 days following December 31, 2013) audited consolidated
balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2013, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP. Parent
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, but
excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the Companys preparation
of its annual and quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their

 



38  respective Representatives in connection with the Financing, including the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives
contemplated by this Section 5.04(e), and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to (a)
any information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) any
fraud or intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any
such persons.

SECTION 5.05. _Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
to any release or other public statement to the extent containing information
that is consistent with the joint press release referred to below or any other
release or public statement previously issued or made in accordance with this
Section 5.05; _provided further_ , that the Company need not consult Parent in
connection with the matters referred to in and in accordance with Section
5.02, including any press release or public statement to be issued or made
in order to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change made pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 5.02, and Parent need not consult the Company in
connection with any matters referred to in Section 5.02. The parties hereto
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby following execution of this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company. Except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including the first sentence of
this Section) or as required by Law, no party shall issue any press release or
make any public statement regarding the other party or the other partys
operations, directors, officers or employees without obtaining the other
partys prior written consent.

SECTION 5.06. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to applicable
Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts
and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parents
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request. Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company. The
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
reasonably be expected to violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation
of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the protection of an
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other legal privilege or
expose the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or
personal information. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
immediately 

 



39  preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its reasonable efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of
such privilege. For the avoidance of doubt, until the Effective Time, all
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 5.06 or pursuant to Section 5.02 will be subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, it is expressly
acknowledged and agreed by each party hereto that, from and after the date
hereof, for all purposes hereunder and under the Confidentiality Agreement,
the restrictions in paragraph 11 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to have expired and been terminated and be of no further force and
effect.

SECTION 5.07. _Indemnification and Insurance._ (a) From and after the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ ") with
respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the Company or such
Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such
Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under
clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including
any Action relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof or in any agreement in existence
as of the date hereof providing for indemnification between the Company and
any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, commencing at the
Effective Time and continuing for a period of six years, shall cause, unless
otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date hereof in the
Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, advance any 

 



40  expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any
Indemnitee under this Section 5.07 (including in connection with enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 5.07) as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the
individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it shall be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.07(a) or under applicable Law.

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Action
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.07 (each, a "
_Claim_ ") for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnitee
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, if the aggregate annual
premium for such insurance exceeds 300% of the current annual premium for such
insurance, then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the
applicable individuals with the best coverage as is then available at a cost
up to but not exceeding 300% of such current aggregate annual premium. The
Company may (or if requested by Parent, the Company shall), in consultation
with Parent, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or prior to the Effective
Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 600% of the
current annual premium for such insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy has
been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation,
and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for
insurance pursuant to this Section 5.07(c).

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.07 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws, by Contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.07 shall not be terminated or modified

 



41  in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this Section 5.07 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee has consented in
writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.07 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.07). 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.07.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall,
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.07 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

SECTION 5.08. _Rule 16b-3._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

SECTION 5.09. _Employee Matters._ (a) During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2014 (the " _Continuation Period_
"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or in the
case of a transfer of all or substantially all the assets and business of the
Surviving Corporation, its successors and assigns) to provide, each
individual who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with
target total compensation (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include
equity-based incentive compensation) and benefits, in each case, that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the target total compensation and
benefits provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, that solely with respect to base salary, the Continuation
Period shall be deemed to be the later of December 31, 2014 and December 31 of
the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.09(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume and honor in accordance with their terms all of the Company Plans
(including any change in control severance agreement or other arrangement that
is a Company Plan), in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time,
including with respect to any payments, benefits or

 



42  rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event) it being
understood that the foregoing shall not limit the right of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to amend any Company Plan
in accordance with its terms.

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes (except as set forth below), including determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and
early retirement subsidies, each Company Employees service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary)
shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the
assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and assigns);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would (i) result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service, (ii) apply for purposes of determining an
accrued benefit under any defined benefit retirement plan, (iii) to the
extent not recognized by the Company for similar purposes, or (iv) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.09(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Closing, the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to fully comply with all notice, consultation, effects bargaining or
other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor organization, works
council or group of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect
to any Company Employees based outside of the United States, Parents
obligations under this Section 5.09 shall be modified to the extent necessary
to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and political
subdivisions thereof in which such Company Employees are based.

 



43 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control", the Closing shall
be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control".

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 5.09 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.09 (i) is intended to, or
shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, (ii) obligates
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to
retain the employment of any particular employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time or (iii) results in any current or
former director, employee, consultant or any other individual associated
therewith being regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this
Agreement or have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

SECTION 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters; Stockholder Litigation._ Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or from
any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any Actions commenced or,
to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to or offered without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

SECTION 5.11. _Parent Vote._ (a) Parent shall vote (or consent with respect
to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or
with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by
agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted or to provide a consent,
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of
the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and at all
adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of
stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a meeting).

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.12. _Post-Closing Arrangements._ (a) Following the Effective Time,
Parent intends to maintain the "Life Technologies" name as a brand of

 



44  the combined company. To support the scale of the combined business, Parent
expects to invest further to expand its global capabilities, especially in the
Carlsbad, California area.

 

(b) Parent intends to nominate at least one member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, selected by Parent, for appointment to the Board of Directors
of Parent effective at the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.13. _Tax Certificate._ The Company shall deliver to Parent at the
Closing a certification satisfying the requirements of Sections 1.897-2(h) and
1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury Regulations certifying that interests in the
Company are not "U.S. real property interests" within the meaning of Section
897(c) of the Code.

Affiliates or any other person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Miscellaneous_

SECTION 8.01. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties._ None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

SECTION 8.02. _Amendment or Supplement._ At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
action taken by the respective Boards of Directors of each of the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that

 



49  following approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
such approval. Any amendment or supplement to this Agreement shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 

SECTION 8.03. _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)

party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such partys
conditions (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed
a single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court
within the State of Delaware). In addition, each of the parties hereto (i)
consents to submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of such courts in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any of

 



51  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any
objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial
proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware or, in the
event each federal court within the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court within the State of
Delaware) and (iv) consents to service of process being made through the
notice procedures set forth in Section 8.10.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not, and will not permit its Affiliates to, bring or support any action,

otherwise, against the lenders, agents or arrangers under the Financing
described in the Commitment Letter nor their respective Affiliates, successors
or assigns nor any other debt financing sources (collectively, the " _Lender
Related Parties_ ") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including with respect to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing described
in the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than

New York and agrees that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 8.09
hereof shall be applicable to any such proceeding.

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. Subject to the
following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 8.07(b), without proof of damages or otherwise, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 8.08 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the End Date,
any party hereto brings any Action, in accordance

 



52  with Section 8.07, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended (x) for the period during which such Action is pending, plus 10
