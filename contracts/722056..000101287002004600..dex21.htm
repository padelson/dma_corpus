by and among INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION, a New York
corporation ("Parent"), BARRON ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and RATIONAL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,

At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 



 SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 11:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be not later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or waived on such
second business day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business
day on which all such conditions shall havebeen satisfied or waived. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date".

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall (i) file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and (ii) make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time". 



 SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. 



 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as amended, shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until hereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (as defined in Section 3.01(d)). 



 (b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 



 SECTION 1.06. _Directors_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

2 ARTICLE II



_Conversion of Securities_



 SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Sub: 



(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub, par value $0.01 per share, shall be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company, as treasury stock, Parent
or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (x) shares to be canceled and retired in accordance with Section 2.01(b),
(y) the Appraisal Shares (as defined in Section 2.01(d)) and (z) shares of
Restricted Stock (as defined in Section 3.01(c)) to the extent set forth in
Section 5.04(iii)) shall be converted into the right to receive $10.50 in
cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time
such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The right of any holder of any share of
Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to
and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable
tax law.



(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist,

 

3 and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.



 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"), and, from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available, or cause the Surviving Corporation to make available, to the Paying Agent funds for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent. 



 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail (and shall make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (which instructions shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, 

 

4 on behalf of Parent, as promptly as practicable in accordance with the
customary procedures of the Paying Agent, in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made
to a person (as defined in Section 8.03) other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.



 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 



 (d) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.01(d))), any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 



 (e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the receipt, at the option of such person, of an indemnity or bond (provided that such indemnity or bond is reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation) against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration. 

 

5 (f) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 



ARTICLE III

 SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set forth in the letter (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to which the information stated in such disclosure relates) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

---|---|--- 



 

 (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each subsidiary of the Company. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each such subsidiary are owned by the Company, by another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), except for transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws, and are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, limited liability company or other entity. 



 (c) _Capital Structure._ (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 500,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business on December 4, 2002, (A) 195,254,867 shares of Company Common Stock (excluding treasury shares) were issued and outstanding, (B) 16,188,118 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company as treasury shares, (C) options to acquire 60,998,508 shares of Company Common Stock from the Company pursuant to the 1997 Stock Option Plan (as amended), the 1997 Supplemental Stock Plan (as amended), the 1998 Indian Stock Option Plan, the 2000 Director Option Plan and any other plan or arrangement providing for the grant of options to service providers (including employees, directors and consultants) to the Company or any of its affiliates (as defined in Section 8.03) or any predecessors thereto (such plans, collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") were issued and outstanding, (D) 4,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), (E) 3,588,620 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to a right of repurchase by the Company, subject to forfeiture back to the Company and/or subject to transfer or lock-up restrictions (such shares, together with any similar shares issued after December 4, 2002, are herein referred to as "Restricted Stock"). No shares of Company Common Stock are owned by any subsidiary of the Company. The Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete list, as of the close of business on December 4, 2002, of (x) all outstanding options or other rights to purchase or acquire Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (such options and rights, together with any similar options or rights issued after December 4, 2002, are herein referred to as "Stock Options"), the number of shares subject to each such Stock Option, the grant dates and exercise prices and vesting schedule of each such Stock Option and the names of the holders thereof and (y) all shares of Restricted Stock, the date any forfeiture or repurchase condition lapses for each share of Restricted Stock, any repurchase price for any share of Restricted Stock and the names of the holders thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Stock Options, rights under the 

 

7 ESPP, the Restricted Stock, the Convertible Notes (as defined in Section
3.01(c)(ii)) and the Exchangeable Shares (as defined in Section 3.01(c)(ii)),

the ESPP, based on the assumption that the value of Company Common Stock on
the last day of the Exercise Period (as defined in Section 5.04(g)) will be

Stock reserved for issuance upon redemption or retraction of the Class A Non-
Voting Preference Shares in the capital of 1386501 Ontario Limited (the
"Exchangeable Shares"), as of the close of business on December 4, 2002, no
shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the
Company, or options, warrants or other rights to acquire any such stock or
securities were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Since December
4, 2002, until the date of this Agreement, (x) there have been no issuances
by the Company of shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, the Company other than issuances of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the exercise of Stock Options or rights under the ESPP, in
each case outstanding on such date as required by their terms as in effect on
the date of this Agreement or pursuant to the exchange of Exchangeable Shares
for Company Common Stock and (y) there have been no issuances by the Company
of options, warrants, shares of deferred stock, restricted stock awards, stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock awards, other rights to acquire shares of
capital stock or other equity or voting interests from the Company or other
rights that are linked in any way to the price of Company Common Stock or the
value of the Company or any part thereof, other than for rights that may have
arisen under the ESPP. As of the date of this Agreement, there are
no outstanding stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or other
rights (other than rights that may have arisen under the ESPP) that are linked
in any way to the price of the Company Common Stock or the value of the
Company or any part thereof whether or not granted in tandem with a related
Stock Option.



(iii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all
shares that may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the ESPP

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive
rights. Except

 

8 for the Convertible Notes and the Exchangeable Shares, there are no (A) bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and (B) except as set forth above, securities or other

case, the value of which is in any way based upon or derived from any capital
or voting stock of the Company or which has or which by its terms may have at
any time (whether actual or contingent) the right to vote (or which is
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
may vote. Except (A) as set forth above, (B) for rights that have arisen under
the ESPP and (C) for the Convertible Notes and the Exchangeable Shares, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants,
calls, rights, contracts, commitments, agreements, instruments, arrangements,
understandings, obligations or undertakings of any kind to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is bound, obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call,
right, contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, arrangement,
understanding, obligation or undertaking. Except for shares of Restricted
Stock, there are not any outstanding contractual obligations of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) vote or dispose of any shares of
the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any of its
subsidiaries. The Company is not a party to any voting agreements with respect
to any shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company
(as defined in Section 8.03), as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
irrevocable proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any shares of the
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.



(iv) The conversion price per share of Company Common Stock of any debt
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries convertible into shares
of Company Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement is as set forth on
Section 3.01(c)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 



 (d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.01(r)) and to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the 

 

9 Company, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by

of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries under, or give rise to any increased, additional,

respective properties or assets are bound by or subject to or otherwise under
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has rights or benefits or (iii)
subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in the
following sentence, any (A) statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation (each,

material respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or (z) prevent

 

10 or materially impede or delay the consummation of any of the transactions

(x) have a material adverse effect on the Company, (y) impair in any material
respect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or (z) prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(e) _SEC Documents_. The Company has filed with the SEC, and has heretofore
made available to Parent, true and complete copies of, all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required to be filed with the SEC by
the Company since January 1, 1999 (together with all information incorporated
therein by reference, the "SEC Documents"). No subsidiary of the Company is
required to file any report, schedule, form, statement or other document with
the SEC. As of their respective dates, each of the SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
SEC Document, and none of the SEC Documents at the time it was filed contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, except to the extent that
information contained in any SEC Document filed and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement (a "Filed SEC Document") has

 

11 been revised or superseded by a later filed Filed SEC Document, none of the
SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The financial statements (including the related
notes) of the Company included in the SEC Documents comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end audit adjustments). Except as set forth in the Filed SEC Documents, the
Company and its subsidiaries have no liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that individually or in
the aggregate are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company.



(f) _Information Supplied_. None of the information included or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting (as
defined in Section 5.01(b)) or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub in connection with the preparation of
the Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.



(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of the most recent
audited financial statements included in the Filed SEC Documents, the Company
and its subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not been (A) any

Each Contract of the Company or any of its subsidiaries of a type listed in
Section 3.01(i)(i) of this Agreement (each such Contract, whether or not filed
as an exhibit to the Filed SEC Documents, a "Material Contract") is in full
force and effect (except for those Contracts that have expired in accordance
with their terms) and is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company
or its subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
of each other party thereto, enforceable against the Company or such
subsidiary, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the Company, against
the other party or parties thereto, in each case, in accordance with its
terms, except for such failures to be in full force and effect, to be legal,
valid and binding or to be enforceable that individually or in the aggregate
are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has performed or is performing all
material obligations required to be performed by it under its Material
Contracts and is not (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) in
breach or default in any material respect thereunder, and, to the knowledge of

respect thereunder except, in each case, for such breaches, defaults, waivers
or failures that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no circumstances that are reasonably likely to

 

17 occur that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to perform its obligations under any
Material Contract, except for such circumstances that individually or in the
aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company.



(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has made available to

since January 1, 1999 has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws and
Judgments of any Governmental Entity applicable to their businesses or
operations, except for instances of possible noncompliance that individually
or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to (i) have a material adverse
effect on the Company, (ii) impair in any material respect the ability of the
Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) prevent or
materially impede or delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries has received, since January 1, 1999 and through the date of
this Agreement, a notice or other written communication alleging a possible
violation by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any applicable Law or
Judgment of any Governmental Entity applicable to its businesses or

domestic and foreign, governmental consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, certificates, filings, notices, permits, concessions,
franchises, licenses and rights (collectively "Permits") necessary for them
to own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their
businesses as now conducted and there has occurred no violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event giving to
any other person any right of termination, amendment or cancellation of, any
such Permit, except for the lack of Permits and for such violations, defaults
or events that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Merger, in and of itself,
is not reasonably likely to cause the revocation or cancellation of any such
Permit, which revocation or cancellation is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

medical or other material plan, arrangement or understanding (whether or not
subject to the laws of the United States) maintained, contributed to or
required to maintained or contributed to by the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or any other person that, together with the Company, is treated
as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any
other applicable Law (each, a "Commonly Controlled Entity"), in each case,
providing benefits to any Company Personnel (all such plans, arrangements or
understandings including any such plan, arrangement or understanding which is
entered into or adopted on or after the date hereof, collectively,
"Benefit Plans") or made any material change in the manner in which
contributions to any Pension Plans (as defined in Section 3.01(m)) are made or
the basis on which such contributions are determined. Except as disclosed in
the Filed SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a
party to any Benefit Agreement. There are no collective bargaining or other
labor union agreements to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which it is bound. Since January 1, 1999 and through the date of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had any actual or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened employee strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts. Except with respect to instances that

Laws relating to employment and employment practices, occupational safety and
health standards, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and

subsidiaries threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or any

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or
analogous state law; (v) there have been no Releases (as defined below) or
threatened Releases of Hazardous Substances (as defined below) on, at, under

investigations, cleanup, governmental response, removal or remediation,
natural resources damages, property damages, personal injuries, medical
monitoring, penalties, contribution, indemnification and injunctive relief)
arising out of, based on or resulting from (x) the presence or Release of, or
exposure to, any Hazardous Materials at any location or (y) the failure to
comply with any Environmental Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Laws" shall mean any applicable Federal, state or local,
domestic or foreign, statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, codes,
enforceable requirements, agreements, orders, decrees, judgments, Permits or

20 "ERISA")), "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) (each, a "Pension Plan") and all other Benefit Plans and all material
Benefit Agreements that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (1)
each Benefit Plan and each material Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any
unwritten Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements, descriptions thereof), (2) the
two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with respect to each Benefit Plan, (3)
the most recent summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for which such
summary plan description is required and (4) each trust agreement and group
annuity contract relating to any Benefit Plan. Each Benefit Plan has been
administered in accordance with its terms, except where the failure so to be
administered individually or in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries
and all the Benefit Plans are in compliance with all applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws, except for instances of
possible noncompliance that individually or in the aggregate are
not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.



(ii) All Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified are so qualified and have
been the subject of determination letters from the IRS or other Governmental
Entity with respect to all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and
Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or have a remaining period of time
under applicable Law to submit such determination letter to the effect that
such Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from United States Federal income
taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no
determination letter has been revoked (or has revocation been threatened) and
no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination letter
or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan that would
adversely affect the qualification of such Pension Plan or increase the costs
relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA, except for
events that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect on the Company. All Pension Plans required to have
been approved by any foreign Governmental Entity have been so approved or
timely submitted for approval, no such approval has been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the
most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Pension Plan
that would affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs
relating thereto, except for events that individually or in the aggregate are
not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The
Company has made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the
most recent determination or approval letter received with respect to
each Pension Plan, as well as a true, complete and correct copy of each
pending application for a determination or approval letter, if any.



(iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has maintained,
contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has

 

21 any actual or contingent liability under, any Benefit Plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA or is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan.



(iv) There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or
oral, that would prevent any Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan as defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA (each, a "Welfare Plan") (including
any Welfare Plan covering retirees or other former employees) from being
amended or terminated without material liability to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time (except for accrued
benefits payable thereunder or ordinary administrative expenses). No Welfare
Plan provides benefits after termination of employment, except where the cost
thereof is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible dependents
or beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code.



(v) No Company Personnel will be entitled to any additional compensation or
benefits under any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement or any acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any compensation or benefits as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any benefits the value of
which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or
in conjunction with the termination of employment, other than a termination
by the Company, at or following the Effective Time) will (A) trigger any
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits
or (B) result in any violation or breach of, or a default (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) under, any Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.



(vi) The deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of the Benefit
Plans or Benefit Agreements will not be subject to disallowance under Section
162(m) of the Code or any other applicable Law.



(vii) Since January 1, 1999 and through the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries has received notice of, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there are no (A) pending termination proceedings or other claims
(except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Benefit
Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement that individually or in the aggregate are reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect on the Company or (B) pending investigations (other
than routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
Benefit Plan or Benefit Agreement.



(viii) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in
connection with the Benefit Plans or Benefit Agreements that are required to
have been made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries have been timely made
in all

 

22 material respects. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
incurred any unfunded liabilities in relation to any Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement. No Pension Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such
term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether
or not waived. 



(ix) With respect to each Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction in which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any
of their respective employees has engaged that could subject the Company, any
of its subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, or, to the knowledge
of the Company, a trustee or other fiduciary of any trust created under any
Benefit Plan, to any material tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of
ERISA or any other applicable Law and (B) none of the Company, any subsidiary
of the Company, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or other
fiduciary of any Benefit Plan has engaged in any transaction or acted in a
manner that could, or failed to act so as to, subject the Company,
any subsidiary of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary to any material liability for breach
of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law.



(x) The Company and its subsidiaries do not have any material liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a Benefit Plan or Benefit
Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.



(xi) Each of the Company Personnel set forth on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(A) of
the Company Disclosure Letter has executed and delivered a binding agreement
that includes a provision substantially similar to the provision set forth on
Section 3.01(m)(xi)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the Company
Personnel set forth on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(B) of the Company Disclosure
Letter has executed and delivered a binding agreement substantially in the
form set forth on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(B) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
each of the Company Personnel set forth on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(C) of the
Company Disclosure Letter has executed and delivered a binding agreement
substantially in the form set forth on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(C) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and, in each case, copies of such agreements have been
provided to Parent. Other than the Company Personnel set forth on Section
3.01(m)(xi)(A) or (C) of the Company Disclosure Letter and except as provided
in Section 5.04(a)(ii) or Section 5.04(g), (i) no Company Personnel has

such Company Personnel is employed (which

 

23 shall be provided to Parent within three weeks of the date hereof), or (ii)
no Company Personnel is entitled to receive any (A) severance, termination or
similar benefits in an amount that is more than $25,000 greater than (I) the
minimum amount required to be provided by any applicable Law or (II) the
amount provided pursuant to the severance plan listed on Section 3.01(m)(i)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, as applicable, (B) bonus payments in excess
of $25,000 (other than bonus payments made in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice pursuant to a broad-based bonus program which
is set forth on Section 3.01(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter) or
compensation provided outside the ordinary course of business (including any
relocation bonus or benefit, or any compensation, indemnity or tax gross-up
agreement related to the maintenance or sale of any residence) under existing
agreements with, or plans or programs of, the Company or any of its affiliates
or (C) any other payment or benefit that is related to, or contingent upon,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the accelerated vesting of Stock Options and
shares of Restricted Stock or the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by such
Company Personnel to the Company or any of its affiliates and (iii) to the
actual knowledge of the Relevant Executives (as defined below) after
reasonable inquiry and investigation, no Company Personnel is entitled to
receive any of the payments or benefits described in clauses (ii)(A) or (B)
above without regard to the $25,000 threshold contained in such clauses. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Relevant Executives" means each
executive officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any
other person reporting to such officer who had knowledge of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the date hereof.



(n) _Taxes_. (i) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries and each Company
Affiliated Group (as defined below) has timely filed all Federal, state and
local, domestic and foreign, income and franchise tax returns and reports
and all other tax returns and reports required to be filed by it and all such
returns and reports are complete and correct, except for such failures to file
or to be complete and correct that individually or in the aggregate are not
reasonably likely to result in a material liability for the Company. Each of
the Company and its subsidiaries and each Company Affiliated Group has timely
paid all taxes due with respect to the taxable periods covered by such returns
and reports and all other taxes, and the most recent financial statements
contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all taxes
payable by the Company and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements, except for
failures to pay or reserve for such taxes that individually or in the
aggregate are not reasonably likely to result in a material liability for the
Company.



(ii) No Federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, income or franchise tax
return or report or any other material tax return or report of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or any Company Affiliated Group is currently under
audit or

 

24 examination by any taxing authority, and no written or unwritten notice of
such an audit or examination has been received by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. There is no deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment
or matter in controversy with respect to any taxes due and owing by the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or any Company Affiliated Group (except for
those arising after the date of this Agreement that individually or in the
aggregate are not reasonably likely to result in a material liability for the
Company). Each deficiency resulting from any completed audit or examination
relating to taxes by any taxing authority has been timely paid. No issues
relating to taxes were raised by the relevant taxing authority during any
presently pending audit or examination, and no issues relating to taxes were
raised by the relevant taxing authority in any completed audit or examination
that could reasonably be expected to recur in a later taxable period, except
for issues first raised after the date of this Agreement that individually or
in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to result in a material liability
for the Company. All assessments for taxes due and owing by the Company, any
of its subsidiaries or any Company Affiliated Group with respect to
completed and settled examinations or concluded litigation have been paid. As
of the date of this Agreement, no Federal, state or local, domestic or
foreign, tax return or report of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any

any taxes and no power of attorney (other than powers of attorney authorizing
employees of the Company to act on behalf of the Company) with respect to any
taxes has been executed or filed with any taxing authority. 



(iv) No Liens for taxes exist with respect to any assets or properties of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for taxes not
yet due and Liens for taxes that the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
contesting in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been established. 



(v) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party to or bound by
any tax sharing agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to taxes with any

(vi) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be required to
include in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time material taxable

25 statements of the Company included in the Filed SEC Documents) in a prior
taxable period but was not recognized for tax purposes in any prior taxable
period as a result of the installment method of accounting, the completed
contract method of accounting, the long-term contract method of accounting,
the cash method of accounting or Section 481 of the Code or comparable
provisions of state or local tax law, domestic or foreign, or for any other
reason.



(vii) No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in cash
or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Company Personnel who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Benefit Plan, Benefit Agreement or
other compensation arrangement currently in effect would be characterized as
an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code) and no such disqualified individual is entitled to receive any
additional payment ( _e.g._ , any tax gross-up or other payment) from
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other person in the event that
the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such
disqualified individual.



(viii) The Company and its subsidiaries have complied with all applicable Laws
relating to the payment and withholding of taxes (including withholding
of taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code or
similar provisions under any Federal, state or local laws, domestic or
foreign) and have, within the time and the manner prescribed by law, withheld
from and paid over to the proper governmental authorities all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws, except for
failures to withhold or pay over that individually or in the aggregate are not

All such material tangible assets and properties, other than assets and properties in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, are free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens and Liens that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

respects with the terms of all material leases to which it is a party

effect, except for such instances of noncompliance or failures to be in full
force and effect that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company and its
subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such material
leases, except for failures to do so that individually or in the aggregate are
not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

enforceable against Parent and Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its

termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of a
material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any

Parent and Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or
materially impede or delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

participate

 

40 in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person (other

obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may,
in response to a bone fide written Takeover Proposal that such Board of
Directors determines in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal (as defined below), was unsolicited and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02, and subject to
compliance with Section 4.02(c) and (d), (x) furnish information with respect
to the Company and its subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
which contains terms that are equivalent to, and in no respect less favorable
to the Company than, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated
September 16, 2002, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from

to Parent and the Company immediately after the execution of this Agreement;

breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company.



For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or Sub) relating
to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect

publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or
any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or recommend, or propose
publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or
resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action or any such
resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change"), unless the Board of Directors of the Company
or a committee thereof determines in good faith that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, (ii) adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal or

 

41 propose publicly to adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree
to take any such action or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into

agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "Acquisition
Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) or resolve or agree
to take any such action. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.02 (b) to
the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the
Board of Directors of the Company may, in response to a Superior Proposal that
was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section
4.02(a), cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(f) and concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(f), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 7.01(f)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have
complied with all the provisions of this Section 4.02, including the
notification provisions in this Section 4.02, and with all applicable
requirements of Sections 5.06(b) (including the payment of the Termination Fee
(as defined in Section 5.06(b)) prior to or concurrently with such
termination) in connection with such Superior Proposal; and _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) until after the fifth
business day following Parents receipt of written notice (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal, identifying the person making
such Superior Proposal and stating that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(f) (it being understood and agreed that, prior to any such termination
taking effect, any amendment to the price or any other material term of a
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
five business day period).



For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona
fide binding written offer not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries made by a third party which, if consummated, would
result in such third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such
third party and the Company, the stockholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company
Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good
faith judgment to have a higher value than the consideration payable in the
Merger and which proposal is determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company to be more favorable to the Companys stockholders
than the Merger, in each case taking into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise.

 

42 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal (including any subsequent amendment or other modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person making such Takeover Proposal. The Company will (i) on a daily basis, update Parent regarding the material resolved and unresolved issues related thereto (including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material terms) and (ii) promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent with copies of all documents and written communications relating to such Takeover Proposal exchanged between the Company or any of its officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on the one hand, and the party making a Takeover Proposal or any of its officers, directors, investment banks, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, on the other hand. 



 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b). 

 



 SECTION 4.03. _Conduct by Parent_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, except as consented to in writing by the Company prior to such action or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, take any action that would or is reasonably likely to result in (i) any representation and warranty of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue (as so qualified) or (ii) any such representation and warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect.

comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide
Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii)
shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC
prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the
Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 (b) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the fifth business day immediately following the date of the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting the Company shall, absent any Legal Restraint which has the effect of preventing such action, cause to occur on the 20th calendar day (or, if such calendar day is not a business day, the first business day subsequent to such calendar day) immediately following the mailing of the Proxy Statement (the "Stockholders Meeting"), for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval, regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject it or any other Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred at 

 

44 any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the Company is unable to obtain
a quorum of its stockholders at such time, the Company may extend the date of
the Stockholders Meeting by no more than ten business days and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts during such ten-business day
period to obtain such a quorum as soon as practicable and (ii) the
Company may delay the Stockholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Company reasonably determines that such delay is required by
applicable Law to comply with written or oral comments made by the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement (the date on which the Stockholders Meeting
would be held pursuant to this Section 5.01(b) (without giving effect to any
extension pursuant to Section 5.01(c) or 5.01(d)) the "Meeting Date"). Subject
to Section 4.02(b)(i), the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
to holders of the Company Common Stock that they adopt this Agreement, and
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other
person of any Takeover Proposal.



 (c) Parent may, in its sole discretion, extend, prior to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, any of (x) the time period from the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company as set forth in Section 5.01(a) and (y) the time period from the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company to the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is held as set forth in Section 5.01(b) (in each of (x) and (y), after giving effect to any extension thereof resulting from the exercise by the Company of any of its rights provided for in Section 5.01(d)); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the aggregate extensions by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) and the Company pursuant to Section 5.01(d) extend the Meeting Date by more than ten (10) calendar days. 



 (d) The Company may, in its sole discretion, extend, prior to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company, any of (x) the time period from the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement to the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company as set forth in Section 5.01(a) and (y) the time period from the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company to the date on which the Stockholders Meeting is held as set forth in Section 5.01(b) (in each of (x) and (y), after giving effect to any extension thereof resulting from the exercise by Parent of any of its rights provided for in Section 5.01(c)); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will the aggregate extensions by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.01(d) and Parent pursuant to Section 5.01(c) extend the Meeting Date by more than ten (10) calendar days. 



 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) At Parents reasonable request, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, afford to Parents officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, 

 

45 environmental consultants and other advisors and representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement to all their respective properties,
assets, books, contracts, commitments, directors, officers, employees
(including all software developers), attorneys, accountants, auditors (and, to
the extent within the Companys control, former auditors), other advisors and
representatives and records for due diligence or integration planning purposes
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, make available to Parent, and provide to Parent copies or
originals if specifically requested by Parent of, (i) each report, schedule,
form, statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of any applicable Law or Judgment (other than
the notification pursuant to the HSR Act or other antitrust filings, which
shall be provided, if requested by Parent, pursuant to a joint defense
agreement in customary form entered into between Parent and the Company or
each of their respective counsel), (ii) all organizational documents, stock
certificates and other evidences of equity interests, shareholders registers
and other registers of equity interests, minute books, certificates of
good standing, authorizations to do business and certified accounts of each
subsidiary of the Company and (iii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (including
the work papers of Ernst and Young LLP); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not entitle Parent or its officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors and representatives to have
access to any patent application of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Except as required by any applicable Law or Judgment, Parent will hold, and
will direct its officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors and representatives to hold, any and all
information received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 5.02(a), Parent shall not perform any soil,
groundwater or other "invasive" testing (as opposed to "non-invasive" site
assessments) of any of the Companys properties prior to the Effective Time
without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, as and to the extent requested by Parent, provide Parent with (A) a complete and correct list of all licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") and held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "FCC Licenses"), (B) complete and correct copies of each FCC License, (C) the address and physical location of the device(s) covered by each FCC License, (D) a written description of the purpose of the device(s) covered by each FCC License, (E) complete and correct copies of any Notices of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture issued by the FCC against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (F) all reasonable information necessary for Parent to make an independent determination that the Company and its subsidiaries have complied with FCC rules regarding changes of ownership control of the FCC Licenses (including descriptions of any transactions that effected a change of ownership or control 

 

46 of the FCC Licenses (including any intracompany reorganizations) and corporate
organizational charts depicting the ownership structure of the holder of the
FCC Licenses before and after any such change of ownership or control.)



 (c) The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective subsidiaries to, cooperate to develop a mutually acceptable integration plan. 

 



 SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, if any), (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity and (iv) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any party hereto be obligated to (A) agree or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar arrangement with respect to, (x) any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any portion of any business of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or (y) any material assets (whether tangible or intangible) or any material portion of any business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (B) litigate any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative brought by any Governmental Entity, (1) challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger; (2) seeking to prohibit or limit in any material respect the ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of a material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to require any such person to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as a result of the Merger; or 

 

47 (3) seeking to prohibit Parent or any of its affiliates from effectively
controlling in any material respect the business or operations of the Company
or its subsidiaries. The Company and Parent shall provide such assistance,
information and cooperation to each other as is reasonably required to obtain
any such nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
and, in connection therewith, will notify the other person promptly following
the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity and of any request by
any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional information
in respect of any registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, such
Governmental Entity and shall supply the other person with copies of all
correspondence between such person or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other hand.



 (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) would not be satisfied or (ii) the failure of it to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 



 (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) any representation or warranty made by it or Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) would not be satisfied or (ii) the failure of it or Sub to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed by such party under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 



 (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that this Section 5.03(d) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense. 



 SECTION 5.04. _Equity Awards_. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any required consents but not including the payment of any cash or non-cash consideration without Parents consent) as may be required to effect the following: 

 

48 (i) each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
with an exercise price of less than $15.57 per share (each, a "Substituted
Stock Option") (other than those granted under the ESPP) shall be converted
into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under the Substituted Stock Option, the number of shares of
Parent common stock, par value $0.20 per share ("Parent Common Stock")
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Substituted Stock Option by
a fraction (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions
Tape on the ten trading days immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time occurs at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
equal to (1) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Substituted Stock Option divided
by (2) the Option Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Option");
_provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Substituted Stock Option that is
intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code), and that may not be adjusted in the foregoing manner and remain an
incentive stock option, shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements
of Section 424 of the Code in a manner which most closely produces the
economic results obtained with respect to other Adjusted Options (it being
understood that it is the intention of the parties that Substituted Stock
Options so assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum extent permissible
following the Effective Time, as "incentive stock options" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code), to the extent that such Substituted Stock Options
qualified as "incentive stock options" prior to the Effective Time);



(ii) each Stock Option with an exercise price of $15.57 or more per share of
Company Common Stock (each, an "Affected Stock Option") shall be terminated
prior to the Effective Time by taking all actions required by the applicable
provisions of the relevant Company Stock Plans regarding termination of Stock
Options in connection with certain corporate transactions such as mergers and
reorganizations of the Company and sales of substantially all of the assets
of the Company including, without limitation, (A) providing timely notice (to
allow for the termination of the Affected Stock Options prior to the Effective
Time) to holders of Affected Stock Options that neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries shall assume such Affected Stock Options or substitute Parent
options for such Affected Stock Options, (B) permitting holders of Affected
Stock Options to exercise such Affected Stock Options during the
applicable exercise period specified by the applicable Company Stock Plan
(which, in each case, shall expire on the date that is no later than one day
before the Effective Time) (the "Exercise Period") and (C) terminating the
Affected Stock Options upon the expiration of the Exercise Period;

 

49 (iii) subject to Section 5.04(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each
share of Restricted Stock outstanding at the Effective Time shall be converted
at the Effective Time into an amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration
(the "Restricted Stock Cash Amount"), which shall be subject to, and payable
to the holder of such shares of Restricted Stock (each, a "Holder") in
accordance with, Section 5.04(f);



(iv) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as Parent and the
Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger;



(v) take such action as necessary under the Company Stock Plans to ensure
that all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting and all
repurchase rights with respect to the Substituted Stock Options and shares of
Restricted Stock, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall
not have already lapsed, and all other terms thereof, shall remain in full
force and effect pursuant to their terms with respect to the corresponding
Adjusted Options and Restricted Stock Cash Amounts after giving effect to the
Merger and the assumption by Parent as set forth below; and

 



(vi) ensure that any shares of Company Common Stock that have not been issued
under any Company Stock Plan (the "Residual Shares") shall be converted at
the Effective Time into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of the number of such Residual Shares and the Option Exchange
Ratio (the "Assumed Shares").



 (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans, with the result that (A) all obligations of the Company under the Company Stock Plans, including with respect to Substituted Stock Options outstanding at the Effective Time, shall be obligations of Parent following the Effective Time and (B) Parent may issue the Assumed Shares after the Effective Time pursuant to the exercise of options or other equity awards granted under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan of Parent or any its affiliates. Parent may assume the Adjusted Options under an existing equity incentive plan. 



 (c) Within five business days immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall either (i) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares subject to the Adjusted Options or (ii) assume the Adjusted Options under an existing equity incentive plan with respect to which a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) is currently effective. Any such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) as long as any Adjusted Options may remain outstanding. 

 

50 (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted Options and that such Adjusted Options and agreements shall be assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.04 after giving effect to the Merger). 



 (e) A holder of an Adjusted Option may exercise such Adjusted Option in whole or in part in accordance with its terms by delivering a properly executed notice of exercise to Parent, together with the consideration therefor and the Federal withholding tax information, if any, required in accordance with the related Company Stock Plan. 



 (f) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with an escrow agent designated by Parent an amount equal to the aggregate Restricted Stock Cash Amounts, which amount shall be held in escrow and shall be paid in accordance with this Section 5.07(f). Each Holder shall be entitled to receive the Applicable Portion (as defined below) of the aggregate Restricted Stock Cash Amounts after each Lapse Date (as defined below); provided that if the Holder is not employed by Parent or its affiliates on a Lapse Date, the Holder shall not be entitled to receive the Applicable Portion for such Laspe Date and any subsequent Lapse Date and such Applicable Portion shall be paid to Parent; provided, however, that promptly after the Holders termination date, the Holder shall receive a cash payment equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price (as defined below). Promptly after each Lapse Date, Parent shall instruct the escrow agent to pay the Applicable Portion, as appropriate, to the applicable Holder or to Parent. For purposes hereof, (i) "Applicable Portion" means, in respect of each Holder, an amount equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Restricted Stock held by such Holder at the Effective Time that would have vested or with respect to which the Companys right to repurchase would have lapsed on the applicable Lapse Date and (ii) "Lapse Date" means, in respect of any shares of Restricted Stock, each date on which such shares would have vested or the Companys right to repurchase such shares would have lapsed pursuant to such terms and conditions as were applicable under such Restricted Stock, and (iii) "Repurchase Price" means, in respect of the Applicable Portion, the price paid by the Holder for the shares of Restricted Stock held by such Holder at the Effective Time that would have vested and/or with respect to which the Companys right to repurchase would have lapsed after the Holders termination date. 



 (g) Parent and the Company shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.04 and any other acquisitions of Parent equity securities or dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the Interpretive Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3. 

 

51 (h) The Company shall take any actions with respect to the ESPP as are necessary to provide that (i) participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were participants on the date hereof, (ii) such participants may not increase their payroll deduction election or purchase elections from those in effect on the date hereof, (iii) the ESPP shall terminate, effective immediately before the Effective Time, (iv) each purchase right under the ESPP outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be automatically exercised by applying the payroll deductions of each current participant in the ESPP for such exercise period, as defined in the ESPP (each, an "Exercise Period") to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the provisions of the ESPP regarding the number of shares purchasable per participant) at a purchase price per share equal to 85% of the lower of (A) the fair market value per share of Company Common Stock on the Offering Date (as defined in the ESPP) and (B) the fair market value per share of Company Common Stock on the last business day before the Effective Time and (v) there shall not be any additional Exercise Period commencing following the date of this Agreement under the ESPP. 



 SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company and/or its subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing obligations. 



 (b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05. 



 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and officers than the insurance coverage otherwise 

 

52 required under this Section 5.05(c); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent be required to pay annualized aggregate premiums for insurance
under this Section 5.05(c) in excess of 200% of the amount of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company for the period from June 30, 2002 to, and
including, June 30, 2003 for such purpose (which premiums for such period are
hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $1,811,000); _provided_
that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such 200% amount.

 



 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 



 SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 



 (b) In the event that (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly proposed by any person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates) or such person has publicly announced its intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or such a Takeover Proposal or intention has otherwise become widely known to the Companys stockholders, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the date that is five business days prior to the date of such termination) or 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company or any of its subsidiaries enters into any definitive agreement providing for, or consummates, any Takeover Proposal (solely for purposes of this Section 5.06(b)(i)(C), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed references to 40%), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $65,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent (w) in the case of a termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c), within two business days after such termination (x) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f), concurrently with such termination and (y) in the case of a payment as a result of any event referred to in Section 5.06(b)(i)(C), upon the first to occur of such events. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such 

 

53 payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06(b), the Company shall
pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating thereto,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06(b) at
the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.



 SECTION 5.07. _Benefits Matters_. (a) Except as set forth below, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor, or cause to be honored, all obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under Benefit Agreements and Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms thereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating such Benefit Agreements and Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and with applicable Law. 



 (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (including reasonable best efforts to obtain all required consents but, except as consented to in writing by Parent, excluding the payment of any money or the provision of any other benefit) to have each Company Personnel who is party to an agreement or entitled to receive any compensation, benefit or payment, in each case, that is required to be listed on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(D) of the Company Disclosure Letter to execute and deliver prior to the Effective Time a binding agreement that includes a provision substantially similar to the provision set forth on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(A) of the Company Disclosure Letter hereto, a copy of which agreement shall have been provided to Parent prior to the Effective Time; provided that no Company Personnel shall be required to execute and deliver any such agreement with respect to any agreement, compensation, benefit or payment specifically listed on Section 3.01(m)(xi)(D) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 



 SECTION 5.08. _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall not issue any press release with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other party, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system, in which circumstances reasonable efforts to consult with the other party will still be required to the extent practicable. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all communications material to employees of the Company made on the day of the public announcement of the Merger shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any public statements (other than press releases) with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not make any such public statement prior to such reasonably practicable 

 

54 consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system.



 SECTION 5.09. _Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Sub to comply with all of Subs obligations under this Agreement. Sub shall not engage in any business other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



 SECTION 5.10. _Delivery of Material Contracts_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, and in no event later than the third business day immediately following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall make available to Parent at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation in New York City true and complete copies of all Material Contracts listed on Section 3.01(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (including true and complete copies of any (A) Code Release Agreements, (B) Major Customer Contracts and (C) Alliance Contracts) and thereafter the Company shall provide to Parent true and complete copies of any such Contracts specifically requested by Parent promptly following such request unless the Company is prohibited from providing such copies to Parent under the terms of the applicable Material Contract, in which case the Company shall make such Material Contract available to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.10. 



 SECTION 5.11. _Convertible Notes_. (a) The Company shall deliver, or shall cause to be provided, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture dated as of February 2, 2000 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and State Street Bank and Trust Company of California, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), relating to the Convertible Notes, to the Trustee and to each Holder (as defined in the Indenture) as promptly as possible after the date hereof but in no event less than 20 days immediately prior to the Effective Time, the notice required by Section 12.6 of the Indenture.

such consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications or orders set forth

 SECTION 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than the provisions of the penultimate sentence of Section 5.02(a), Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and Article VIII and except for any material breach of this Agreement by any party hereto (which material breach and liability therefor shall not be affected by termination of this Agreement or any payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(b)).
