such shares of Credence Common Stock shall have been converted and the right
to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares
in accordance with Section 1.6(e) and any dividends or distributions payable

(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to LTX
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(e) will be paid to the

applicable Legal Requirements,  



 

4  following surrender of any such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without
interest (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of LTX
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of LTX Common Stock and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date

the issuance thereof that the Certificates or Book Entry Shares so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Persons (as defined in Section 8.3(d)) requesting such exchange will have
paid to LTX or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as
defined in Section 2.6(a)) required by reason of the issuance of shares of LTX
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates or Book Entry Shares surrendered, or established to the
reasonable satisfaction of LTX or any agent designated by it that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of LTX, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Credence Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirements, and to collect IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or similar
information from the recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of LTX Common Stock or Credence
Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on
which any shares of LTX Common Stock, and any cash payable to the holder of
such Certificate pursuant to Section 1.6(e) or any dividends or distributions
payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to Section 1.7(d) would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 2.3(c)), any such shares of LTX Common Stock or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares six
months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving
Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according
to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
the Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not surrendered such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in compliance with this Section 1.7 shall
after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation look only to LTX, as a
general unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim for shares of LTX Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(e) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to Section 1.7(d) with respect to the shares of Credence Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Credence Common
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or
other distributions paid in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(e) and
1.7(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Credence  



 

5  Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Credence Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of LTX Common
Stock, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.6(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d); _provided_ , _however_ , that LTX may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against LTX,
Credence or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

procedures are designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Credence in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Credences management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). The principal executive
officer and principal financial officer of Credence have made
all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Credence and each of its Subsidiaries
has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements

of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the

Credence, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Credences assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements of Credence and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Credence,

weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by Credence and its Subsidiaries, (B) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves Credences management or other
Credence Employees, or (C) any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing. In connection with the periods covered by the Credence Financials,
Credence has disclosed to LTX all deficiencies and weaknesses identified in
writing by Credence or Credences independent auditors (whether current or
former) in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting utilized by Credence and its Subsidiaries.

businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and, since such date, there has not been (i) any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect that individually or in the aggregate has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on

avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation or other form of
published guidance as a "listed transaction," as set forth in Treasury

(b)  _Schedule_. Section 2.12(b) of the Credence Disclosure Schedule contains
an accurate and complete list of each Credence Benefit Plan and each Credence
Employee Agreement. Neither Credence nor any ERISA Affiliate has any plan or
commitment to establish, adopt or enter into any new Credence Benefit Plan or
Credence Employee Agreement or to modify any Credence Benefit Plan or Credence
Employee Agreement (except to the extent required by Legal Requirements or to
conform any such Credence Benefit Plan or Credence Employee Agreement to any
applicable Legal Requirements, or as required by this Agreement) that would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Credence and its
ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.

 

(c) _Documents_. Credence has provided or made available to LTX correct and
complete copies of: (i) all documents embodying each Credence Benefit Plan
and each Credence Employee Agreement required to be disclosed pursuant to
Section 2.12(b) above including all amendments thereto and all related trust

material to Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (viii) all
material correspondence to  



 

17  or from any governmental agency relating to any Credence Benefit Plan; and
(ix) the three (3) most recent plan years discrimination tests for
each Credence Benefit Plan for which such tests are required.

(d) _Benefit Plan Compliance_.

(i) With respect to each Credence Benefit Plan, no event has occurred and, to
the Knowledge of Credence, there exists no condition or set of circumstances,
in connection with which Credence or any of its ERISA Affiliates would be
subject to any liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Legal
Requirement material to Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 

(ii) Each Credence Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects,
administered and operated in accordance with its terms, with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable material Legal
Requirements and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.
Each Credence Benefit Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that
is capable of approval by, and/or registration for and/or qualification for
special tax status with, the appropriate taxation, social security and/or
supervisory authorities in the relevant country, state, territory or the like
(each, an "Approval") has received such Approval or there remains a period of
time in which to obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any material
amendment that has not previously received such Approval, except for the lack
of such Approvals which, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted
in and would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to
Credence and its Controlled Group Affiliates, taken as a whole. Except as
required by Legal Requirements, no condition exists that would prevent
Credence or LTX from terminating or amending any Credence Benefit Plan at any
time for any reason without material liability to Credence and its ERISA
Affiliates, taken as a whole (other than ordinary administration expenses or
routine claims for benefits).

(iii) No material written representation or commitment with respect to any
material aspect of any Credence Benefit Plan has been made to a Credence
Employee by an authorized Credence Employee that is not materially in
accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of
such Credence Benefit Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to Credence and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.
Neither Credence nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding, whether written or oral, with any trade union,
works council or other Credence Employee representative body or any material
number or category of its Credence Employees which would prevent, restrict or
materially impede the implementation of any lay-off, redundancy, severance or
similar program within its or their respective workforces (or any part of
them).

(iv) There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, any Credence Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed
claims for benefits), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced
or, to the Knowledge of Credence, is threatened or reasonably anticipated
(other than routine claims for benefits), with respect to any material claim,
which would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to Credence
and its Controlled Group Affiliates, taken as a whole.

(e) _Plan Funding_. With respect to Credence Benefit Plans, there are no
material benefit obligations for which required contributions have not been
made or accrued to the extent required by GAAP and there are no material
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on
the financial statements of Credence. The assets of each Credence Benefit Plan
which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and
records of such Credence Benefit Plan.

(f) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither Credence nor any ERISA Affiliate of
Credence has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to any (i) Credence Benefit Plan which is or was subject to Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) "multiple employer plan" as defined in
ERISA or the Code, or (iv) "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section
419 of the Code. No Credence Benefit Plan provides health benefits that are
not fully insured through an insurance contract.



 

18 (g) _Continuation Coverage_. No Credence Benefit Plan provides post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect
to any Person for any reason other than coverage mandated by applicable Legal
Requirements, and neither Credence nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever contracted
to any Credence Employee (either individually or to Credence Employees as a
group) or any other Person that such Credence Employee(s) or other Person
would be provided with post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, except to
the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements or, individually or in
the aggregate, as has not resulted or would not reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to Credence and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a
whole.

(h) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Credence Benefit Plan or Credence Employee Agreement that will
or may result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration of any material payment, forgiveness of material
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, material increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Credence Employee. No payment
or benefit which will or may be made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Credence or any ERISA Affiliate with respect
to any Credence Employee or any other "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder) will be characterized as a
"parachute payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.
There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which Credence or any
ERISA Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any Credence
Employee for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. Section
2.12(h) of the Credence Disclosure Schedule lists all persons who Credence
reasonably believes are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) as
determined as of the date hereof.

(i) _Section 409A_. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) sponsored or maintained by Credence
and each ERISA Affiliate has been operated since January 1, 2005 in
reasonable, good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable
IRS guidance. No nonqualified deferred compensation plan has been "materially
modified" (within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October
3, 2004. No stock option or other right to acquire Credence Common Stock or
other equity of Credence has any feature for the deferral of compensation
other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise
or disposition of such option or rights.

(j) _Stock Option Grant Practices_. Credences past and current stock option
grant practices (i) complied and comply with all applicable Credence Stock
Plans, stock exchange rules and applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) have been
fairly presented in accordance with GAAP in the Credence Financials, and
(iii) have resulted only in exercise prices that correspond to the fair market
value on the date that the grants were actually authorized under applicable
Legal Requirements, in each case except for any such failures, individually
or in the aggregate, that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. As of the date of this Agreement, Credence has no ongoing internal
review of any past or current stock option practice, and Credence is not
aware of the existence of any reports on any such reviews completed since
January 1, 2005.

(k) _Labor_. Neither Credence nor any of its Subsidiaries is presently a party
to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, trade union agreement,
works council, employee representative agreement, union contract, or
information or consultation agreement, other than national or industry-wide
agreements, with respect to employees and no collective bargaining agreement
is being negotiated by Credence or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge
of Credence, there are no activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any employees of Credence or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no
labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against Credence or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Credence, threatened or
reasonably anticipated which would reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with the business activities of Credence and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. None of Credence, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor
practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of
Credence or any of its Subsidiaries, except, individually or  



 

19  in the aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Credence, threatened or reasonably
anticipated relating to any labor, safety or discrimination matters involving
any employee, including charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination
complaints, which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither Credence nor any of
its Subsidiaries have incurred any liability or obligation under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar state or local law
which remains unsatisfied that is material to Credence and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(l) _Employment Matters_. Credence is in compliance with all applicable
foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting
employment (including but not limited to the classification of any Person as
an employee or independent contractor), employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, in each case, with respect to
employees, except, individually or in the aggregate, as has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Credence and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(m) _International Employee Matters_.

(i) With respect to each Credence Benefit Plan that is maintained outside the
jurisdiction of the United States or primarily covers Credence Employees
residing or working outside the United States, (A) the Credence Benefit Plan
has been established, maintained and administered in all material respects in
compliance with its terms and all applicable Legal Requirements, (B) all
contributions and expenses that are required to be made have been made or
properly accrued, and (C) with respect to any such Credence Benefit Plan that
is intended to be eligible to receive favorable tax treatment under the Legal
Requirements applying to such Credence Benefit Plan, all requirements
necessary to obtain such favorable tax treatment have been satisfied.

(ii) There is no term of employment for any Credence Employee residing or
working outside the United States providing that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall entitle such Credence
Employee (A) to treat the change of control as a breach of any contract, (B)
to any payment, benefit or change of terms of employment (whether or not
conditioned upon the occurrence of any other event) or (C) to treat himself or
herself as redundant or released from any obligation to his or her employer.

2.13 _Title to Properties_.

(a) _Leases_. Section 2.13(a) of the Credence Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of all real property leases or other agreements for the occupancy of real
property to which Credence or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of them is bound as of the date hereof, and all amendments, guaranties and
modifications thereof (each, a "Credence Lease"). Except as set forth in the
Credence Leases or as disclosed in the Credence Disclosure Schedule, no party
has a right to occupy any of the premises subject to a Credence Lease
("Credence Leased Property") except for Credence or its Subsidiaries. Credence
has made available to LTX a true and complete copy of each Credence
Lease. All such Credence Leases are valid and in full force and effect
against Credence or any Subsidiary of Credence party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of Credence, each other party thereto, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity, and, with respect to Credence or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any of such leases, no rental payments are past due and
there is no existing default or event of default (or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default), except, individually
or in the aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonable be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) _Properties_. Section 2.13(b) of the Credence Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a list of all real property owned by Credence or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Credence Owned Property" and collectively with  



 

20  Credence Leased Property, the "Credence Real Property"). With respect to
Credence Owned Property, Credence has made available to LTX copies of the
deeds and other instruments (as recorded) by which Credence or any of its
Subsidiaries acquired such parcel of property, and copies of all title
insurance policies, opinions, abstracts and surveys in the possession of
Credence or any of its Subsidiaries relating thereto. There are no pending
or, to the Knowledge of Credence, threatened condemnation or eminent domain
actions or proceedings, or any special assessments or other activities of any
public or quasi-public body that are reasonably likely to materially
adversely affect Credences title to Credence Real Property. To the Knowledge
of Credence, there are no facts or conditions which would, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the
transferability, financability, ownership, leasing, use, development,
occupancy or operation of any such real property. Neither Credence nor any
Subsidiary has received any written notice from any insurance company of any
defects or inadequacies in any Credence Real Property or any part thereof
which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
insurability of such property or the premiums for the insurance thereof, nor
has any written notice been given by any insurer of any such property
requesting the performance of any repairs, alterations or other work with
which compliance has not been made. There are no leases, subleases, licenses
or agreements, written or oral, granting to any party or parties (other than
Credence or any of its Subsidiaries) the right of use or occupancy of any
portion of the Credence Real Property. There are no outstanding options or
rights of first refusal to purchase the Credence Real Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein.

(c) _Valid Title_. Credence and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid
title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and
mixed, used or held for use in its business that are material to Credence and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, free and clear of any Liens, except for
(i) Liens imposed by law in respect of obligations not yet due which are owed
in respect of Taxes or (ii) Liens which are not material in character, amount
or extent, and which do not materially detract from the value, or materially
interfere with the present use, of the property subject thereto or affected
thereby.

similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) is
subject to general principles of equity. Neither Credence nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of, or has failed to perform any
act which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both would constitute a
default under the provisions of, any Credence Material Contract, and neither
Credence nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has
breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any
Credence Material Contract, in each case in such a manner as would permit any
other party to cancel or terminate any such Credence Material Contract, or
would permit any other party to seek damages or other remedies, for any or
all of such breaches, violations or defaults, except, individually or in the
aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To
the Knowledge of Credence, no third party has violated any provision of, or
committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both would constitute a material default under the provisions of, any
Credence Material Contract. 

2.16 _Insurance_. Credence maintains insurance policies covering Credence, its
Subsidiaries and their respective employees, properties or assets, including
policies of property, fire, workers compensation, products liability,
directors and officers liability and other casualty and liability insurance,
against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are customary for the
businesses in which Credence and its Subsidiaries are currently engaged. As of
the date hereof, such policies are in full force and effect, no notice of
cancellation has been received, and there is no existing default or
event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would  



 

24  constitute a default, by any insured thereunder, except, individually or in
the aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Credence and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

2.17 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or
on behalf of Credence for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
registration statement on Form S-4 (or similar successor form) to be filed
with the SEC by LTX in connection with the issuance of LTX Common Stock
in connection with the Merger (including amendments or supplements thereto)
(the "Registration Statement") will, at the time the Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Credence for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be filed with the SEC as part of the Registration
Statement (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") will, at the time the Proxy

and at the time of the LTX and Credence Stockholders Meetings (as defined in
Section 5.2(a)), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. If at any time before the Effective Time, Credence
obtains Knowledge of any event relating to Credence or any of its affiliates,
officers or directors which is required to be set forth in an amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Credence shall promptly inform LTX. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Credence with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus about LTX supplied by LTX for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

2.18 _Board Approval_. The Board of Directors of Credence has, by resolutions
duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting of all directors duly called and

declared this Agreement and the Merger to be advisable, (b) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (c)
recommended that the stockholders of Credence adopt this Agreement, and (d)

received a written opinion from Lehman, dated as of June 20, 2008, to the
effect that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Credence Common Stock, other than Credence,
LTX or their respective subsidiaries. A signed copy of such opinion will be
provided to LTX as promptly as practicable following receipt thereof by
Credence.

2.20 _Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of Credence has taken all
necessary actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in such Section 203),
and any other similar Legal Requirement, shall not apply to the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement, the Credence Stockholder Voting
Agreements or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Credence Stockholder Voting Agreements.

2.21 _Rights Plan_. Neither Credence nor any of its Subsidiaries has in
effect a stockholder rights plan or "poison pill."

2.22 _Shell Company Status_. Credence is not a "shell company" as that term
is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

2.23 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article III, and any certificate
delivered by LTX or Merger Sub in connection with Closing, Credence  



 

25  acknowledges and agrees that none of LTX, Merger Sub or any other Person on
behalf of LTX or Merger Sub makes, nor has Credence relied upon or otherwise
been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to LTX or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided
to or made available to Credence in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Except as provided in Section 5.10, neither LTX,
Merger Sub nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to Credence or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Credence, or Credences use of, any such information,
including any information, documents, projections forecasts or other material

stockholders of LTX may vote. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by LTX and Merger Sub and, assuming due execution and delivery by
Credence, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of LTX and Merger Sub,

the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of LTX or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any LTX Material Contract (as defined in Section

and procedures are designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by LTX in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to LTXs management

Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The principal executive officer and principal financial

its Subsidiaries has established and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance

to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of LTX and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of LTX and its
Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and the Board of Directors of LTX, and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of LTXs assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements of LTX and its Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of LTX, since the date of LTXs most recent Form 10-Q filed with the
SEC, neither LTX nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any LTX Employee),
nor LTXs independent auditors, has identified or been made aware of (A) any

internal control over financial reporting utilized by LTX and its
Subsidiaries, (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves LTXs
management or other LTX Employees, or (C) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing. In connection with the periods covered by the LTX
Financials, LTX has disclosed to Credence all deficiencies and weaknesses
identified in writing by LTX or LTXs independent auditors (whether current or
former) in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting utilized by LTX and its Subsidiaries. 

(e) _Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Nasdaq_. LTX is in compliance in all material
respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
(ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
Nasdaq.

extent applicable) and the related rules of the SEC and the Public Company

tax avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation or other form
of published guidance as a "listed transaction," as set forth in Treasury
Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

(g) Neither LTX nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or has failed
to take any action or has Knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan or other
circumstance that would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a

of its Subsidiaries is a party, including the provisions of this Agreement,
covering any employee, consultant or director of LTX or any of its

of any Person other than LTX or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) is a party to
or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar
agreement.

(j) Neither LTX nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payments, is
obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any Contract that could
obligate it to make any payments that may be treated as an "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, determined without regard to Section
280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code.

material to LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(ii) Each LTX Benefit Plan has been, in all material respects, administered
and operated in accordance with its terms, with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable material Legal Requirements and the
terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Each LTX Benefit
Plan, including any material amendments thereto, that is capable of Approval
has received such Approval or there remains a period of time in which to
obtain such Approval retroactive to the date of any material amendment that
has not previously received such Approval, except for the lack of such
Approvals which, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted in and
would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to LTX and
its Controlled Group Affiliates, taken as a whole. Except as required by Legal
Requirements, no condition exists that would prevent LTX or Credence from
terminating or amending any LTX Benefit Plan at any time for any reason
without material liability to LTX and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole
(other than ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for
benefits). 

(iii) No material written representation or commitment with respect to any
material aspect of any LTX Benefit Plan has been made to an LTX Employee by
an authorized LTX Employee that is not materially in accordance with the
written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such LTX Benefit
Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to LTX and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole. Neither LTX nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement, arrangement or understanding,
whether written or oral, with any trade union, works council or other LTX

its or their respective workforces (or any part of them).

connection with, any LTX Benefit Plan (other than routine undisputed claims

routine claims for benefits), with respect to any material claim, which would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to LTX and its
Controlled Group Affiliates, taken as a whole.

(e) _Plan Funding_. With respect to LTX Benefit Plans, there are no material
benefit obligations for which required contributions have not been made or
accrued to the extent required by GAAP and there are no material benefit
obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise
properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on the
financial statements of LTX. The assets of each LTX Benefit Plan which is
funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of
such LTX Benefit Plan.

(f) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither LTX nor any ERISA Affiliate of LTX
has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to
any (i) LTX Benefit Plan which is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA or

4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) "multiple employer plan" as defined in ERISA or

or retiree welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any
Person for any reason other than coverage mandated by applicable Legal
Requirements, and neither LTX nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever contracted to
any LTX Employee (either individually or to LTX Employees as a group) or any
other Person that such LTX Employee(s) or other Person would be provided with
post-termination or retiree welfare benefits, except to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements or, individually or in the aggregate, as has
not resulted or would not reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to LTX and its ERISA Affiliates, taken as a whole.

(h) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any LTX Benefit Plan or LTX Employee Agreement that will or may
result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration of any material payment, forgiveness of material
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, material increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any LTX Employee. No payment or
benefit which will or may be made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by LTX or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to
any LTX Employee or any other "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code
Section 280G and the regulations thereunder) will be characterized as a
"parachute payment," within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.
There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which LTX or any ERISA
Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any LTX Employee
for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code. Section 3.12(h) of
the LTX Disclosure Schedule lists all persons who LTX reasonably believes are
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder) as determined as of the date
hereof.

each ERISA Affiliate has been operated since January 1, 2005 in reasonable,
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable IRS
guidance. No nonqualified deferred compensation plan has been "materially
modified" (within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October
3, 2004. No stock option or other right to acquire LTX Common Stock or other
equity of LTX has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the
deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition
of such option or rights.

(j) _Stock Option Grant Practices_. LTXs past and current stock option grant
practices (i) complied and comply with all applicable LTX Stock Plans, stock
exchange rules and applicable Legal Requirements, (ii) have been fairly
presented in accordance with GAAP in the LTX Financials, and (iii) have
resulted only in exercise prices that correspond to the fair market value on
the date that the grants were actually authorized under applicable Legal
Requirements, in each case except for any such failures, individually or in
the aggregate, that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of
the date of this Agreement, LTX has no ongoing internal review of any past or
current stock option practice, and LTX is not aware of the existence of any
reports on any such reviews completed since January 1, 2005.

or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, trade union agreement, work
council, employee representative agreement, union contract, or information or
consultation agreement, other than national or industry-wide agreements, with
respect to employees and no collective bargaining agreement is being
negotiated by LTX or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of LTX, there
are no activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any employees
of LTX or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike or work
stoppage against LTX or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge
of LTX, threatened or reasonably anticipated which would reasonably be
expected to materially interfere with the business activities of LTX and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of LTX, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective representatives or employees has committed any unfair labor
practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of LTX
or any of its Subsidiaries, except, individually or in the aggregate, as has
not had and as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on LTX and its  



 

37  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor
disputes or grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of LTX, threatened
or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor, safety or discrimination
matters involving any employee, including charges of unfair labor practices or
discrimination complaints, which, if adversely determined, would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither LTX nor any of its
Subsidiaries have incurred any liability or obligation under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar state or local law
which remains unsatisfied that is material to LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

(l) _Employment Matters_. LTX is in compliance with all applicable foreign,
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting employment
(including but not limited to the classification of any Person as an employee
or independent contractor), employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, in each case, with respect to employees,
except, individually or in the aggregate, as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

(m) _International Employee Matters_.

(i) With respect to each LTX Benefit Plan that is maintained outside the

or working outside the United States, (A) the LTX Benefit Plan has been
established, maintained and administered in all material respects in
compliance with its terms and all applicable Legal Requirement, (B)
all contributions and expenses that are required to be made have been made or
properly accrued, and (C) with respect to any such LTX Benefit Plan that is
intended to be eligible to receive favorable tax treatment under the Legal
Requirements applying to such LTX Benefit Plan, all requirements necessary to
obtain such favorable tax treatment have been satisfied.

(ii) There is no term of employment for any LTX Employee residing or working
outside the United States providing that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall entitle such LTX Employee (A) to treat
the change of control as a breach of any contract, (B) to any payment,
benefit or change of terms of employment (whether or not conditioned upon the
occurrence of any other event) or (C) to treat himself or herself as redundant
or released from any obligation to his or her employer.

3.13 _Title to Properties_.

(a) _Leases_. Section 3.13(a) of the LTX Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all real property leases or other agreements for the occupancy of real
property to which LTX or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound as of the date hereof and all amendments, guaranties and
modifications thereof (each, an "LTX Lease"). Except as set forth in the LTX
Leases or as disclosed in the LTX Disclosure Schedule, no party has a right to
occupy any of the premises subject to a LTX Lease ("LTX Leased Property")
except for LTX or its Subsidiaries. LTX has made available to LTX a true and
complete copy of each LTX Lease. All such LTX Leases are valid and in full
force and effect against LTX or any Subsidiary of LTX party thereto and, to
the Knowledge of LTX, each other party thereto, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity, and, with respect to LTX or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any of such leases, no rental payments are past due and
there is no existing default or event of default (or event which with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default), except, individually
or in the aggregate, as has not had and would not reasonable be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) _Properties_. Section 3.13(b) of the LTX Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
list of all real property owned by LTX or any of its Subsidiaries (the "LTX
Owned Property" and collectively with LTX Leased Property, the "LTX Real
Property"). With respect to LTX Owned Property, LTX has made available to LTX
copies of the deeds and other instruments (as recorded) by which LTX or any
of its Subsidiaries  



 

38  acquired such parcel of property, and copies of all title insurance
policies, opinions, abstracts and surveys in the possession of LTX or any of
its Subsidiaries relating thereto. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge
of LTX, threatened condemnation or eminent domain actions or proceedings, or
any special assessments or other activities of any public or quasi-public body
that are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect LTXs title to LTX
Real Property. To the Knowledge of LTX, there are no facts or conditions which
would, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
effect on the transferability, financability, ownership, leasing, use,
development, occupancy or operation of any such real property. Neither LTX nor
any Subsidiary has received any written notice from any insurance company of
any defects or inadequacies in any LTX Real Property or any part thereof
which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
insurability of such property or the premiums for the insurance thereof, nor
has any written notice been given by any insurer of any such property
requesting the performance of any repairs, alterations or other work with
which compliance has not been made. There are no leases, subleases, licenses

except as enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) is
subject to general principles of equity. Neither LTX nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of, or has failed to perform any

a default under the provisions of, any LTX Material Contract, and neither LTX
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has breached,
violated or defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any LTX
Material Contract, in each case in

such LTX Material Contract, or would permit any other party to seek damages or
other remedies, for any or all of such breaches, violations or defaults,
except, individually or in the aggregate, as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on LTX and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of LTX, no third party has
violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which,

Subsidiaries and their respective employees, properties or assets, including

against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are customary for the
businesses in which LTX and its Subsidiaries are currently engaged. As of the
date hereof, such policies are in full force and effect, no notice of
cancellation has been received, and there is no existing default or event
which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default, by any insured thereunder, except, individually or in the aggregate,
as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on LTX and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of LTX and Merger Sub

Credence Stockholders Meetings, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time
before the Effective Time, LTX obtains Knowledge of any event relating to LTX
or any of its affiliates, officers or directors which is required to be set
forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, LTX shall promptly inform Credence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by LTX

supplied by Credence for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

3.18 _Board Approval_. The Board of Directors of LTX has, by resolutions duly
adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting of all directors duly called and held
and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way prior to the date hereof
(the "LTX Board Approval"), (a) determined that the Merger and the Charter

written opinion from JPMorgan, dated as of June 20, 2008, to the effect that,
as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view,
to LTX. A signed copy of such opinion will be provided to Credence as promptly
as practicable following receipt thereof by LTX.

3.20 _Rights Plan_. LTX has taken all action so that (a) Credence shall not be
an "Acquiring Person" under the LTX Rights Agreement and (b) the entering
into of this Agreement and the Merger and the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the grant of any rights to
any Person under the LTX Rights Agreement or enable or require the LTX Rights
to be exercised, distributed or triggered as a result thereof.



 

42 3.21 _Shell Company Status_. Neither LTX nor Merger Sub is a "shell company,"
other than a "business combination related shell company," as those terms are
defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act.

3.22  _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article II, and any certificate
delivered by Credence in connection with Closing, LTX acknowledges and agrees
that neither Credence nor any other Person on behalf of Credence makes, nor
has LTX relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Credence or with respect to any
other information provided to or made available to LTX in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Except as provided in Section 5.10,
neither Credence nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability
or indemnification obligation to LTX or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to LTX, or LTXs use of, any such information, including any
information, documents, projections forecasts or other material made available
to LTX in certain data rooms or management presentations in expectation of
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, unless any such information
is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in Article II
or in the corresponding section of the Credence Disclosure Schedule.

Proxy Statement/Prospectus relating to the respective Stockholders Meetings
of each of LTX and Credence to be held to consider the Share Issuance and the
Charter Amendment, in the case of LTX, and adoption of this Agreement, in the
case of Credence, and (b) LTX will prepare and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the shares of LTX Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger. Each of LTX and Credence shall provide promptly to the other
such information concerning its business affairs and financial statements as,
in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be
required or appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
the Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 5.1, or in any amendments
or supplements thereto, and shall cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate
with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation and filing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the  



 

49  Registration Statement. Each of LTX and Credence will respond to any
comments from the SEC, will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of LTX and Credence will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff in
connection with the filing of, or amendments or supplements to, the
Registration Statement and/or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Whenever LTX or
Credence becomes aware of the occurrence of any event which is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement, LTX or Credence, as the case may be, will
promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
SEC or its staff, and/or mailing to stockholders of LTX and/or Credence, such
amendment or supplement. Each of LTX and Credence shall cooperate and provide
the other (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus prior to filing such with the SEC, and will provide each
other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Neither LTX nor
Credence shall make any amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement without the approval of the other party, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. LTX and Credence
will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective
stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the Registration Statement
is declared effective by the SEC. Each of the parties hereto shall cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement to comply as to
form and substance as to such party in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act, and

5.2 _Meeting of Stockholders; Board Recommendation_.

(a) _Meeting of Stockholders_. Promptly after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, each of LTX and Credence will
take all action necessary or advisable in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements and its certificate of incorporation or articles of organization
and bylaws to call, hold and convene a meeting of its stockholders
to consider, in the case of LTX, the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment
and, in the case of Credence, adoption of this Agreement (each, a
"Stockholders Meeting") to be held as promptly as practicable after the
declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement. Each of LTX and
Credence will use commercially reasonable efforts to hold their respective
Stockholders Meetings on the same date. Subject to Section 5.3(d), each of
LTX and Credence will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) solicit from
their respective stockholders proxies in favor of, in the case of LTX, the
Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment and, in the case of Credence, the
adoption of this Agreement and (ii) secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or applicable Legal Requirements
to obtain such approvals, including engaging one or more nationally recognized
proxy solicitation firms and information agents to assist in such
solicitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, LTX or Credence, as the case may be, may adjourn or postpone its
Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary (A) to provide any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its respective
stockholders in advance of the vote on the Share Issuance and the Charter
Amendment (in the case of LTX) or the adoption of this Agreement (in the case
of Credence) or (B) if as of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient shares of capital stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to approve such matters thereat or to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such Stockholders Meeting. Each of LTX and Credence
shall ensure that its respective Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by it in
connection with its Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance with
the DGCL (in the case of Credence) or the MBCA (in the case of LTX), its
certificate of incorporation or articles of organization and bylaws, the
rules of Nasdaq and all other applicable Legal Requirements. The obligation of
LTX or Credence, as the case may be, to call, give notice of, convene and hold
its Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.3(g))
with respect to it, or by any withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
recommendation of its Board of Directors with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Charter Amendment and/or the Share Issuance.

by Section 5.3(d): (i) the Board of Directors of each of LTX and Credence

Meetings, (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the

recommended that Credences stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at Credences Stockholders Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of
Directors of LTX or Credence nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend
or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to the other party hereto, the recommendation of its
respective Board of Directors as set forth in the preceding clauses.

5.3 _Acquisition Proposals_. __

(a) _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms or the Effective Time,
each of LTX and Credence agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of the officers, employees and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall not authorize or permit its and its Subsidiaries
Employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant, agent or other representative

to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or
announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any

take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release or authorize the release of any Person
from, or waive or authorize the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement under which it or any of
its Subsidiaries has any rights, or fail to enforce or cause to be enforced in
all material respects each such agreement at the request of LTX (in the case
of an agreement under which Credence has any rights) or Credence (in the case
of an agreement under which LTX has any rights), (iv) take any action to
render inapplicable, or to exempt any third Person from, any state takeover
law or state law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or
the ability to acquire or vote shares of capital stock, (v) publicly approve,
endorse, recommend or take any position other than to recommend rejection
(including withdrawing or modifying in a manner adverse to the other party,

extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(d)) or (vi) enter into
any letter of intent or similar Contract contemplating or otherwise relating
to any Acquisition Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby (other than a
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section 5.3(c)(i)). Each of LTX
and Credence and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives
will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself.

(b) _Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_.

(i) As promptly as practicable (but in any event within one business day)
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal by LTX, Credence or their
respective Representatives, or any material modification of or material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or any request of LTX, Credence or their
respective Representatives for nonpublic information or inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, LTX or Credence,
as the case may be, shall provide the other party with oral and written notice

inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all written and electronic
materials provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. The recipient of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry shall
provide the other party hereto as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within one business day) oral and written notice setting forth all such
information as is reasonably necessary to  



 

51  keep the other party hereto informed in all material respects of the status
and details (including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly (but in any
event within one business day) provide the other party hereto a copy of all
written and electronic materials subsequently provided in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(ii) LTX or Credence, as the case may be, shall provide the other with one
business day prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the
members of its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at
which its Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) _Superior Offers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.3(a), in the event that LTX or Credence, as the case may be,
receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third
party that its Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) is,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Offer (as defined in Section
5.3(g)(ii)), LTX or Credence, as the case may be, may then take any or all of
the following actions (but only (1) if such party has not materially
breached Section 5.3, (2) such partys Stockholders Meeting has not occurred
and (3) to the extent the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements):

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that (A) at least two business days prior to furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives the other party hereto
written notice of its intention to furnish such nonpublic information and the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal and a
copy of all written and electronic materials provided in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, (B) it receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such
third party on Credences or LTXs behalf, as the case may be, the terms of
which (including standstill terms) are at least as restrictive as the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.4(a)),
provided that such agreement shall not contain terms which prevent Credence
or LTX, as the case may be, from complying with its obligations under this
Section 5.3, and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to
the other party hereto (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously so furnished or made available); and

(ii) Engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that at least two business days prior to
entering into negotiations with such third party, it gives the other party
hereto written notice of such partys intention to enter into negotiations
with such third party.

(d) _Change of Recommendation_.

(i) In response to the receipt of a Superior Offer that has not been
withdrawn, the Board of Directors of LTX or Credence, as the case may be, may
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its recommendation in favor of, in the
case of LTX, the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment, and in the case of
Credence, adoption of this Agreement, in each case, in a manner adverse to
the other party, and in the case of a Superior Offer that is a tender or
exchange offer, recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange
offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by a Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, a "Change of Recommendation"), if all of the following
conditions in clauses (1) through (5) are met:

(1) Its Stockholders Meeting has not occurred;

(2) It shall have (A) provided the other party hereto with written notice of
its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation (a "Change of
Recommendation Notice") at least three business days prior to effecting a
Change of Recommendation that relates to (i) a Superior Offer  



 

52  or (ii) any material change to the terms of a Superior Offer to which a
previous Change of Recommendation Notice applies, which shall state
expressly (I) that it has received a Superior Offer, (II) the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of the Person or group
making the Superior Offer, and (III) that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so, and (B) provided
to the other party hereto a copy of all materials and information delivered or
made available to the Person or group making the Superior Offer it has
received;

(3) Either (A) on or before the expiration of the three business day period
following the delivery to the other party hereto of any Change of
Recommendation Notice, the other party hereto does not make a written offer,
which shall be binding and enforceable against the other party and capable of
acceptance by LTX or Credence, as the case may be (a "Matching Bid"), in
response to such Superior Offer, or (B) following receipt of a Matching Bid
within the three business day period following the delivery to the other party
hereto of any Change of Recommendation Notice, the Board of Directors of LTX
or Credence, as the case may be, determines in good faith (at a meeting of the
Board of Directors of LTX or Credence, as the case may be, at which it
consults prior to such determination with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) that after taking into account the Matching Bid, that the
Superior Offer to which the Change of Recommendation Notice applies continues
to be a Superior Offer;

(4) Its Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, following consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer and
after taking into consideration the Matching Bid, if any, the failure of the
Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements; and

(5) It shall not have materially breached any of the provisions set forth in
Section 5.2 or this Section 5.3 (including Section 5.3(b)).

(ii) In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, at any time prior to obtaining, in the case of the stockholders
of LTX, approval of the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment, or in the
case of the stockholders of Credence, the adoption of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of Credence or LTX, as the case may be, may, in response
to a material development or change in circumstances occurring, arising or
coming to the attention of such Board of Directors after the date hereof that
was neither known to the Board of Director of such party nor reasonably
foreseeable as of or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any
Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or change in circumstances,
an "Intervening Event"), make a Change of Recommendation if such Board of
Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal advisors, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of such
Board of Directors to effect such a Change of Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that such party shall
send to the other party hereto written notice of its intention to effect a
Change of Recommendation, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons
therefor, at least three business days prior to effecting a Change of
Recommendation.

(iii) Neither the Board of Directors of Credence nor the Board of Directors of
LTX shall make any Change of Recommendation other than in compliance with and
as permitted by this Section 5.3(d).

(e) _Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Stockholders  Meeting;
No Other Vote_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the obligation of LTX or Credence, as the case may be, to call,
give notice of, convene and hold its Stockholders Meeting shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal, or by any Change of
Recommendation. Neither LTX nor Credence shall submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or publicly propose to do so.



 

53 (f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules; Disclosure_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit LTX or Credence or their respective Boards of
Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of LTX or Credence,
as the case may be, a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to its
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the LTX Board of Directors or
the Credence Board of Directors, as the case may be, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however,
neither LTX or Credence nor their respective Board of Directors may make a
Change of Recommendation except in accordance with Section 5.3(d) hereof.

(g) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer relating to any (i)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes a
substantial portion of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of

taken as a whole, as the case may be, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of any class of equity securities representing 15% or more of the
voting power of Credence or LTX, as the case may be, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group
beneficially owning 15% or more of the voting power of Credence or LTX, as the
case may be, or (iv) merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Credence or LTX or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be
(other than mergers, consolidations, business combinations, recapitalizations,

or LTX, as the case may be, and one or more of its Subsidiaries), in each case
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(ii) "Superior Offer," with respect to LTX or Credence, shall mean an
unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to acquire,
directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,

assets of such party or a majority of the total outstanding voting securities
of such party as a result of which the stockholders of such party immediately
preceding such transaction would hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the
equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or
any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary thereof, on terms that the Board
of Directors of such party has in good faith concluded (following consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial adviser of nationally
recognized reputation), taking into account, among other things, the legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the Person making the
offer and the strategic and other benefits of the Merger, (i) is reasonably
capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, (ii) if consummated on
such terms would result in a transaction that is more favorable to such
partys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of
the Merger, and (iii) is not subject to financing or financing for which is

(a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of LTX, Merger Sub and Credence shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use reasonable best

55  transactions contemplated hereunder, and as promptly as practicable after

documents that it is responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity under
this Section 5.6(a) to comply in all material respects with all applicable

(b) _Exchange of Information_. LTX, Merger Sub and Credence each shall use

any such filings, applications, Briefings, investigation, proceeding or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of such
meeting. 

(c) _Notification_. Each of LTX, Merger Sub and Credence will notify the other
promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or

supplement.

(d) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of Section
5.2 and Section 5.3 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and

accomplish the following: (i) the causing of the conditions precedent set
forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations

execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing,
Credence and its Board of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar
Legal Requirement is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(e) _Limitation on Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
LTX or Credence or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any
divestiture, by itself or any of its affiliates, of shares of capital stock or
of any business, assets or property of LTX or its Subsidiaries or affiliates,
or of Credence or its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the imposition of any
material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses
or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock. Neither
LTX nor Credence shall take or agree to take any action identified in the
immediately preceding sentence without the prior written consent of the other.

5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) _By Credence_. Credence shall give prompt notice to LTX of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Credence to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section
6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied.

(b)  _By LTX_. LTX and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to Credence of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of LTX to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(a) or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied.

5.8 _Third-Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
LTX and Credence will each use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
material consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries
respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that neither
this Section 5.8 nor any other provision of this Agreement shall obligate LTX
or Credence to obtain any consents, waivers or approvals which are conditioned
upon any material payments or incurrence of other material obligations by LTX,
Credence or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

5.9 _Equity Awards and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Assumption of Credence 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and Stock Options_. At
the Effective Time, (i) Credences 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and (ii) each
then outstanding Credence Option, whether or not exercisable at the Effective
Time and regardless of the respective exercise prices thereof, will be assumed
by LTX. Each Credence Option so assumed by LTX under this Agreement will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable Credence Option (including any applicable stock option
agreement or other document evidencing such Credence Option) immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting
provisions), except that (i) each Credence Option will be exercisable (or will
become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
shares of LTX Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of
Credence Common  



 

57  Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Credence Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of LTX Common Stock and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of LTX Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such assumed Credence Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Credence Common Stock at which such
Credence Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each assumed Credence
Option shall be vested immediately following the Effective Time as to the
same percentage of the total number of shares subject thereto as it was vested
as to immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such
Credence Option by its terms in effect prior to the date hereof and not
otherwise amended prior to the Effective Time provides for acceleration of
vesting. Promptly following the Closing Date, LTX will deliver to each Person
who holds an assumed Credence Option a document evidencing the
foregoing assumption of such Credence Option by LTX. Credence shall take all
steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9(a) to
occur.

(b) _Incentive Stock Options_. The conversion of Credence Options provided for
in Section 5.9(a) with respect to any options which are intended to be
"incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

(c)  _Unvested Credence Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, any shares
of LTX Common Stock issued in accordance with Section 1.6(a) with respect to
any unvested shares of Credence Restricted Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall remain subject to the same terms, restrictions
and vesting schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except to the extent by their terms such unvested shares of Credence
Restricted Stock vest at the Effective Time. Credence shall not take or
permit any action which would accelerate vesting of any unvested shares,
except to the extent required by their terms as in effect on the date hereof.
Copies of the relevant agreements governing such Credence Restricted Stock
and the vesting thereof have been provided to LTX. All outstanding rights
which Credence may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase
unvested shares of Credence Restricted Stock shall be assigned to LTX in the
Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by LTX upon the same terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
shares purchasable pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per
share shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. Credence
shall take all steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.9(c) to occur.

(d) _Credence Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each Credence
Restricted Stock Unit then outstanding shall be assumed by LTX. Subject to,
and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Credence Stock Plan and
any applicable award or other agreement, each Credence Restricted Stock Unit
shall be converted into the right to receive the number of shares of
LTX Common Stock (or an amount in respect thereof for cash settled Credence
Restricted Stock Unit) equal to the number of shares of Credence Common Stock
subject to the Credence Restricted Stock Unit multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of LTX Common Stock).
Each Credence Restricted Stock Unit shall have the same terms and conditions
as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Credence shall not
take or permit any action which would accelerate vesting of any Credence
Restricted Stock Unit, except to the extent required by their terms as in
effect on the date hereof. Copies of the relevant agreements governing such
Credence Restricted Stock Unit and the vesting thereof have been provided to
LTX. All outstanding rights which Credence may hold immediately prior to the
Effective Time to the forfeiture of shares of Credence Common Stock subject to
the Credence Restricted Stock Unit shall be assigned to LTX in the Merger
and shall thereafter be held by LTX upon the same terms and conditions in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares
forfeitable pursuant to such rights shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
the Exchange Ratio. Credence shall take all steps necessary to cause the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.9(d) to occur.

(e) _Service Recognition_. From and after the Effective Time, LTX will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with
Credence or its Subsidiaries of each employee of Credence or its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time (the "Credence Current Employees") in connection
with all  



 

58  employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including vacation) of LTX or
its affiliates in which Credence Current Employees are eligible to
participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit amounts under any
defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would
result in duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time, LTX or
the Surviving Corporation shall provide Credence Current Employees health and
welfare benefits pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements maintained by LTX or any Subsidiary of LTX providing coverage
and benefits which are no less favorable than those provided to employees of
LTX in positions comparable to positions held by Credence Current Employees
with LTX or its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, LTX will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation, to cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting
periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with
Credence) under any group health plans of LTX or its affiliates to be waived
with respect to Credence Current Employees and their dependents and to
recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its
medical and dental plans, deductible, co-pay, and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by Credence Current Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

(f) _Termination of Credence Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Credence shall take all action that may be necessary to cause all
participants rights under all current offering periods under Credence
Purchase Plan to terminate on or prior to the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date and to allow all participants to purchase prior to the Effective
Time shares of Credence Common Stock based on any purchase rights accrued as
of such date as provided by the terms of the Credence Purchase Plan. To the
extent shares of Credence Common Stock are not purchased as provide in the
preceding sentence, on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date all
accumulated payroll deductions allocated to each participants account under
the Credence Purchase Plan shall be returned to each participant as provided
by the terms of the Credence Purchase Plan and no shares of Credence Common
Stock shall be purchased under the Credence Purchase Plan for such final
offering period. As of the close of business on the day immediately prior to
the Closing Date, Credence shall have terminated the Credence Purchase Plan
and provided such notice of termination as may be required by the terms of
the Credence Purchase Plan. The form and substance of any such notice
regarding the Credence Purchase Plan termination shall be subject to the
review and approval of LTX, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. 

(g) _Termination of 401(k) Plans_. Unless otherwise requested by LTX in
writing prior to the Effective Time, Credence shall cause to be adopted prior
to the Closing Date resolutions of Credences Board of Directors to cease all
contributions to any and all 401(k) plans maintained or sponsored by Credence
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "401(k) Plans"), and to
terminate the 401(k) Plans, on the day preceding the Closing Date. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval
of LTX, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Credence shall deliver to LTX an executed copy of such resolutions as soon as
practicable following their adoption by Credences Board of Directors and
shall fully comply with such resolutions.

5.10 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Indemnity_. From and after the Effective Time, LTX shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of
Credence or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor entity (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of Credence or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, according to the indemnification provisions of Credences
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, subject to applicable Legal
Requirements, LTX shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill
 



 

59  and honor in all respects the obligations of Credence pursuant to any
indemnification agreement existing prior to the date hereof between Credence
and any Indemnified Party, true and correct copies of which have been
provided to LTX prior to the date hereof. The certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, advancement of expenses and indemnification that are at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Credence as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is
required by law.

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, LTX shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect Credences current
directors and officers liability insurance (the "DandO Insurance") covering
those Persons who are covered by the DandO Insurance as of the date hereof, a
complete and accurate copy of which has been provided to LTX, for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herby, to the extent that such acts or omissions
are covered by the DandO Insurance) on terms and in amounts at least as
favorable to such Persons as provided in the DandO Insurance; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
any one year in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
Credence for such coverage (which Credence represents and warrants to be as
set forth in Section 5.10(b) of the Credence Disclosure Schedule) (and to the
extent the annual premium would exceed 200% of the annual premium currently
paid by Credence for such coverage, LTX shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain the maximum amount of coverage as is reasonably available for such
200% of such annual premium). To the extent that a six year "tail" policy to
extend Credences existing DandO Insurance is available at or prior to the
Closing such that the lump sum payment for such coverage does not exceed 250%
of the annual premium currently paid by Credence for such coverage, Credence
may, at its option, obtain such "tail" policy. In the event that Credence
purchases such "tail" policy prior to the Closing, LTX shall not take any
action to cause the "tail" policy to cease to be in full force and effect and
such "tail" policy shall satisfy LTXs obligation under this Section 5.10.

(c) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Section 5.10 is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on LTX and the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event LTX or the
Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successor and assign
of LTX or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honors the
obligations set forth with respect to LTX or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, in this Section 5.10.

5.11 _Form S-8_. LTX agrees to file with the SEC, no later than ten business
days after the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) relating to the shares of LTX Common Stock issuable with
respect to assumed Credence Options and issuable upon settlement of Credence
Restricted Stock Units eligible for registration on Form S-8 and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such options or other
rights remain outstanding.

5.12 _Treatment as Reorganization_.

(a) None of LTX, Merger Sub or Credence shall, and they shall not permit any
of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action (or fail to take any
action) prior to or following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.



 

60 (b) LTX, on its behalf and on behalf of Merger Sub, and Credence shall execute
and deliver to each of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, counsel to
LTX and Merger Sub ("WilmerHale"), and Morrison and Foerster LLP, counsel to
Credence ("MoFo"), tax representation letters in customary form at such time
or times as reasonably requested by each such law firm in connection with its
delivery of the tax opinions referred to in Section 6.1(f) and tax opinions
satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act. In rendering such opinions, each of such counsel shall be
entitled to rely on the tax representation letters referred to in this Section
5.12(b).

5.13 _Board of Directors and Senior Management_.

(a) On or prior to the Effective Time, LTX shall take all action necessary to
(i) cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of
Directors of LTX effective as of immediately following the Effective Time to
be fixed at nine, (ii) cause the Board of Directors of LTX effective as of
immediately following the Effective Time to consist of (A) LTXs Chief
Executive Officer, (B) Credences Chief Executive Officer, (C) four
additional members of LTXs Board of Directors as of the date hereof
designated by LTX and (D) three additional members of Credences Board of
Directors as of the date hereof designated by Credence, (iii) cause
the individuals identified or designated pursuant to subclauses (B) and (D)
of the preceding clause (ii) to be appointed to the Board of Directors of LTX
effective as of immediately following the Effective Time, and (iv)
effective immediately prior to the appointment of the individuals specified
in the preceding clause (iii), obtain the resignations of the LTX directors
who are not identified or designated pursuant to subclauses (A) and (C) of the
preceding clause (ii). Prior to the time that LTX takes the actions specified
in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, the Board of Directors of Credence
shall approve the nomination for election and the election to the Board of
Directors of LTX of each of the persons identified in such clause (ii).

(b) Credence shall take all action necessary to cause the number of directors
that comprise the full Board of Directors of Credence to be fixed at seven
and to cause one member of LTXs Board of Directors as of the date hereof
designated by LTX (who shall be one of the four members of LTXs Board of
Directors designated pursuant to Section 5.13(a)(ii)(C) above) to be
appointed to the Board of Directors of Credence not more than three and not
less than one day prior to the Closing Date.

(c) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of LTX shall
take all actions necessary to cause (i) LTXs Chief Executive Officer to
continue as Chief Executive Officer of LTX from and after the Effective Time,
(ii) LTXs Chief Financial Officer to continue as Chief Financial Officer of
LTX from and after the Effective Time and (iii) Credence s Chief Executive
Officer to be appointed as the Executive Chairman of the Board of LTX from and
after the Effective Time, each to hold office until his successor is elected
and qualified or otherwise in accordance with the LTX Charter Documents.

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, LTX and Credence
shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any dispositions of Credence Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Credence Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I of this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Credence, and the acquisition of LTX
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to LTX
Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to LTX, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.15 _Merger Sub Compliance_. LTX shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all of
Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.16  _Reservation of LTX Common Stock_. Effective at or prior to the
Effective Time, LTX shall reserve (free from preemptive rights) out of its
reserved but unissued or treasury shares of LTX Common Stock, for the  



 

61  purposes of effecting the conversion of the issued and outstanding shares of
Credence Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, sufficient shares of
LTX Common Stock to provide for such conversion as well as the issuance of
LTX Common Stock upon the exercise or settlement of Credence Options, Credence
Restricted Stock and Credence Restricted Stock Units assumed by LTX under
Section 5.9. 

5.17 _Credence Convertible Notes_.

(a) Credence shall use reasonable best efforts to provide, or shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be provided, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, to the trustee under the Indenture
and to each Holder (as defined in the Indenture), any notices required by the
Indenture in connection with the Merger.

(b) LTX and the Surviving Corporation shall, on the Closing Date, execute such
supplemental indenture to the Indenture as may be required under the Indenture
in connection with the Merger.

(c) Credence or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall use reasonable
best efforts to take all such further actions, including the delivery of any

LTX:

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
LTX and Credence;

(b) by either Credence or LTX if the Merger shall not have been consummated by

resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

and warranties or breach by LTX is curable by LTX prior to the Outside Date,
then  



 

64  Credence may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(h) prior to
30 days following the receipt of written notice from Credence to LTX of such

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses  



 

65  whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that LTX and

acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b) are integral
parts of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without

Agreement to the extent provided in clause (b) of Section 7.2 hereof. 

(iv) _Certain Definitions_. For the purposes of this Section 7.3(b) only,
"Acquisition," with respect to a party hereto, shall mean the transactions
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, that for the purpose of this
definition, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in Section 5.3(g)(i), except that references to "15%" therein
shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Merger by
the stockholders of LTX and Credence, _provided_ , _however_ , after such
approval, no amendment shall be made which by applicable Legal Requirements
or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires
further approval by such stockholders without such further stockholder
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of LTX, Merger Sub and
Credence.

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors, may, to the
extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive

other representations and warranties. The parties hereby agree that no
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Credence
Disclosure Schedule or the LTX Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that (i) such item or other matter is material, (ii)
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Credence Disclosure Schedule or the LTX Disclosure Schedule, respectively, or
(iii) any breach or violation of any Legal Requirements or any Contract
exists or has actually occurred.

8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

8.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Credence Disclosure
Schedule and the LTX Disclosure Schedule, (a) constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in Section
5.10.

8.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

8.8 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. 



 

70 8.9 _Governing Law; Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with
this Section 8.9, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may
not be enforced in or by such courts.

8.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

8.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section
8.11 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF LTX, MERGER SUB AND CREDENCE HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR

THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
