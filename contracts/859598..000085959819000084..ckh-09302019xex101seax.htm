obligations, liabilities (whether known or unknown, whether asserted or
unasserted, whether absolute or contingent, whether accrued or unaccrued,

equity or at law, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, or the

connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement), may be made only against (and are those solely of) the
entities that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this
Agreement or that execute any other Transaction Agreement (each, a

Requirement of Law, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any
and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be
available in equity or at law, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard
the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose liability of a
Contracting Party on any Non-Party Affiliate, whether granted by statute or
based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego,
domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
