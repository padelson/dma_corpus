SECTION 2.7 _Escrow_. The Indemnification Escrow Amount, together with any

associated therewith shall be applied for the payment of any indemnification
obligations of the Indemnitors (as defined herein) pursuant to this Agreement
and otherwise administered pursuant to the Escrow Agreement of even date
herewith by and among the Company, the Shareholder Representative, Parent and
the Escrow Agent, attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").
The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Escrowed Funds shall be
treated as an installment obligation for purposes of Section 453 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and no party shall take any action
or filing position inconsistent with such characterization. For tax purposes,
the Escrowed Funds and all earnings thereon shall be considered owned by

Escrow Agreement and reported as such for all tax reporting purposes, 
_provided_ that that the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Parent out of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount at such times as reasonably requested by Parent
but in no event later than the Termination Date (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement), an amount sufficient to pay taxes on such earnings (as reasonably
determined by Parent and the Shareholder Representative), but in no
event less than an amount equal to the product of 40% and the total amount of
such earnings. The parties also agree, for all federal, state and local tax
purposes, to treat all payments from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the
Indemnitees as an adjustment to, and reduction of, the Purchase Price paid in
the Merger.   

SECTION 2.8 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:   

(a) _Conversion of the Company Stock_. Subject to and in accordance with
Sections 2.6 and 2.10 hereof, (i) each share of the Companys common stock,
$0.001 par value per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined) or any shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.8(b)) shall be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the
right, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such Common Stock,
to receive the per share amount set forth on the Payment Schedule without any
interest thereon, plus the Applicable Escrow Remainder, if any,
upon termination of the Escrow Agreement; (ii) each share of the Companys
Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the " _Series A
Preferred Stock_"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) or any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.8(b)) shall
be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such Series A Preferred Stock, to
receive the per share amount set forth on the Payment Schedule without any
interest thereon, plus the Applicable Escrow Remainder, if any,
upon termination of the Escrow Agreement; (iii) each share of the Companys
Series B Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the " _Series B
Preferred Stock_"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) or any shares of
Series B Preferred Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.8(b)) shall
be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such Series B Preferred Stock, to
receive the per share amount set forth on the Payment Schedule without any
interest thereon, plus the Applicable Escrow Remainder, if any,
upon termination of the Escrow Agreement; and (iv) each share of the
Companys Series C Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the " _Series
C Preferred Stock_"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) or any

shall be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such Series C Preferred Stock, to
receive the per share amount set forth on the Payment Schedule without any
interest thereon, plus the Applicable Escrow Remainder, if any,
upon termination of the Escrow Agreement. The Common Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock shall
together mean " _Company Stock_." As of the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right, upon the surrender of such
certificate, to receive the Purchase Price for each share of such Company
Stock in accordance with this Section 2.8, without interest.   

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Stock that is (i)
held in the treasury of the Company or (ii) owned by Parent or Sub, in each
case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   

(c) _Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and such shares shall immediately thereafter constitute all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL, if the DGCL provides for appraisal rights for such shares of
Company Stock in the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted
into a right to receive the Purchase Price unless such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal (or,
if applicable, dissenters rights). If, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal (or,
if applicable, dissenters rights), such Dissenting Shares shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to
receive the Purchase Price without interest or dividends thereon. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, and, prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or
as required under the DGCL, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.   

SECTION 2.9 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity Rights_ (a) . (a) At the
Effective Time, all options to purchase Common Stock issued by the Company
pursuant to the Stock Plans (as defined in Section 2.9(b)), whether vested or
unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable (each a " _Company Option_
") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall assume any of the Company Options in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions necessary to provide for the cancellation without
payment or consideration therefor, effective at the Effective Time, of all
the outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom shares,
awards of restricted or deferred stock, warrants or other rights related to
or denominated with reference to the securities of the Company (the " _Stock
Rights_ ") heretofore granted under any stock option, restricted stock or
similar agreement, performance unit or similar plan, program, agreement or
arrangement related to or denominated with reference to the securities of the
Company (the " _Stock Plans_ ").   

(c) As provided herein, the Stock Plans and any other plan, program or
arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company or its subsidiary shall terminate
as of the Effective Time and the Company shall ensure that following the
Effective Time no holder of a Stock Right or any participant in any Stock
Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire capital stock of the
Company, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries. The Company will take all necessary steps to ensure that, as of
the Effective Time, none of Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective subsidiaries is or will be bound by any Stock Rights,
other options, warrants, rights or agreements which would entitle any person,
other than Sub or its affiliates, to own any capital stock of the Company,
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries or to
receive any payment in respect thereof.   

SECTION 2.10 _Surrender of Shares of Company Stock; Stock Transfer Books_ (a)
. (a) As soon as practicable (but no later than 10 days) after the Effective
Time, Parent shall mail to each record holder of certificates representing
Company Stock (the " _Company Stock Certificates_ ") a letter of transmittal
in a form approved by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Shareholder Representative with instructions for use in surrendering the
Company Stock Certificates to Parent in exchange for the right to receive
cash pursuant to Sections 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 above. Upon surrender to Parent of
such Company Stock Certificates (or affidavit of loss or destruction in
lieu thereof, including any suitable bond or indemnity that may be reasonably
required by Parent), duly executed and completed to Parents reasonable
satisfaction, Parent shall make payment to the persons entitled thereto by
check or wire transfer, as set forth in the delivery instructions delivered
by the Company, in the amount equal to the price to which such person is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof If payment is to be made to a person
other than the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate
surrendered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other
than the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
or Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   

(b) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of capital stock of the
Company that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any party hereto shall
be liable to any holder of Company Stock Certificates formerly representing
securities of the Company for any amount paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances
or any other actions or things are reasonably necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its

Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of each of Sub and the Company or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in such names and on
such behalves or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
reasonably necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   

SECTION 2.11 _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to the holders of securities of the Company such amounts as
Parent and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent and the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of securities
of the Company.   

SECTION 2.12 _Closing and Closing Date_. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated and the Merger contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1, the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of
this Agreement shall take place (a) at 10:00 a.m. (New York time) no later

defaults as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each
lease or contract, the other party to such lease is not an affiliate of the
Company. The Company has not subleased or otherwise granted any Person the
right to use or occupy any Leased Real Property. The Company has not
collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest in the Leased
Property or any interest therein. Except for the Permitted Encumbrances,

any applicable Laws relating to any material part of the Real Property or the
operation thereof or written notice of condemnation, special assessment or
like, with respect thereto.

properties and services necessary to operate the business of the Company in

because the Company is not and has not been a United States real property
holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

(c) By either Parent or the Company if any court or other Governmental Body of

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this

shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of

ARTICLE IX.    

INDEMNIFICATION    

SECTION 9.1 _Survival_ (a) . (a) The representations and warranties made by
the Company set forth in Article III shall survive the Closing and shall
expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_
") and any liability of the Company with respect to such representations and
warranties shall thereupon cease, provided that if, at any time prior to
the Termination Date, any Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the
Shareholder Representative a written notice alleging facts and circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to cause the existence of an inaccuracy in
or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company
set forth in Article III (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such Indemnitees belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 9.2 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
the Termination Date until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. All representations and warranties made by Parent and Sub
shall terminate and expire as of the Closing Date, and any liability of
Parent or Sub with respect to such representations and warranties shall
thereupon cease. The covenants and agreements of Parent, Sub or the Company,
as the case may be, shall survive until the expiration of the time period for
their performance as provided herein.   

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item of
information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to
be a representation and warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.   

SECTION 9.2 _Indemnification_ (a) . (a) Subject to Section 9.4, from and after
the Closing Date (but subject to Section 9.1(a)), the Shareholders (the "
_Indemnitors_ "), shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the Indemnitees
from and against, and the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be available to
compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages that are
suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third-party claim) and that arise from or as a result
of: (i) any IP Contested Matters and any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Article III (without giving effect to
any Company Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualification or any
similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in
such representation or warranty), (ii) any breach of any agreement or
covenant of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or (iii) any
Legal Proceeding relating to any breach of the type referred to in clauses
(i) or (ii) above (including any Legal Proceeding commenced by any Indemnitee
for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this Article IX).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, amounts to be paid by
the Indemnitors in connection with their indemnification obligations shall
not exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount.   

(b) The Indemnitors shall not be required to make any indemnification payment
pursuant to Section 9.2 until such time as the total amount of all Damages
that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more
of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Indemnitees has or
have otherwise become subject, exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Indemnity Deductible_ ") and then liability for Damages in excess of the
Indemnity Deductible shall be as follows: (i) the first $8,000,000 of Damages
in excess of the Indemnity Deductible shall be borne 75% by the Indemnitors
and 25% by the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the next $8,000,000 of Damages
shall be borne 75% by the Surviving Corporation and 25% by the Indemnitors,
(iii) the next $10,600,000 of Damages shall be borne 75% by the Indemnitors
and 25% by the Surviving Corporation, and (iv) all additional Damages shall
be borne by the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, in the event the matters set forth in Section 9.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Schedule 9.2(b) Matters") result in any liability
for payment in excess of $100,000, up to $400,000 of such excess (the "
_Special Excess_ ") shall be paid by the Indemnitors, without being subject
to the Deductible, as follows: the Special Excess shall be deemed to be paid
from clause (iii) above such that the $10,600,000 set forth in clause (iii)
above shall be recalculated to be an amount equal to (A) $8 million minus
the Special Excess, divided by (B) 0.75, with the result of such
recalculation then being borne 75% by the Indemnitors and 25% by the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with clause (iii) above. In the event the
Schedule 9.2(b) Matters result in any liability for payment, in the aggregate,
in excess of $500,000 (such that the liability is in excess of the $100,000
and Special Excess amounts referred to in the previous sentence), all such
amounts in excess of $500,000 shall be treated as Damages to be paid for in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section, subject to
the Indemnification Deductible and other limitations of the first sentence of
this Section and the other provisions of this Article IX.   

SECTION 9.3 _Exclusive Remedy_. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLAIMS BASED UPON FRAUD
(IN WHICH CASE THE INDEMNITORS SHALL BE SEVERALLY BUT NOT JOINTLY LIABLE AND
IN NO EVENT FOR AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF ANY CONSIDERATION ACTUALLY RECEIVED IN
THE MERGER), FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, RECOURSE OF THE INDEMNITEES TO THE
INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
ESCROW AGREEMENT SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE INDEMNITEES
AGAINST THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THE COMPANYS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
REPRESENTATIVES OR AGENTS (WHO WERE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, REPRESENTATIVES OR
AGENTS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE HEREOF) FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED
OR SUFFERED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT
OF THE MERGER. ANY DISTRIBUTION OF A PORTION OF THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW
AMOUNT TO SATISFY A CLAIM HEREUNDER SHALL BE DONE SO AS TO REDUCE THE
INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ESCROW AGREEMENT. ANY
AMOUNTS REMAINING OUT OF THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT UPON TERMINATION OF
THE ESCROW AGREEMENT SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE INDEMNITORS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE ESCROW AGREEMENT. THE AMOUNT OF INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE
PAID BY THE INDEMNITORS TO THE INDEMNITEES FROM THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW
AMOUNT SHALL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF (OR IF ALREADY PAID TO
THE INDEMNITEES, PROMPTLY REPAID TO THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT IN THE
AMOUNT OF) ANY RECOVERIES ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE INDEMNITEES UNDER
INSURANCE POLICIES OR VIA CONTRIBUTION OR OTHER RELATED PAYMENTS RECEIVED
FROM THIRD PARTIES. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NOTHING IN THIS ARTICLE IX
SHALL BE CONSTRUED OR INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE ANY INDEMNITEE TO FIRST SEEK
REIMBURSEMENT OF ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY SUCH INDEMNITEE FROM ANY OTHER
PERSON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNDER ANY INSURANCE POLICIES. THE
INDEMNITEES SHALL TAKE ALL REASONABLE ACTIONS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO MITIGATE
ANY INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH AN INDEMNITY CLAIM MADE PURSUANT
TO THIS ARTICLE IX.   

SECTION 9.4 _No Contribution_. No Indemnitor shall have any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Company
in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which she, he or it may become subject under or in connection with this
Agreement.   

SECTION 9.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. In the event of the assertion
or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether
against the Company, Parent or against any other Person) with respect to
which any of the Indemnitors may become obligated to hold harmless,
indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article IX,
Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own. If Parent so proceeds with the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:   

(a) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Shareholder Representative shall be borne and paid exclusively from the
Escrowed Funds;   

(b) subject to any confidentiality restrictions to which any Indemnitor may be
subject (provided that upon Parents request, any such Indemnitor will use
its best efforts to have such confidentiality restrictions waived or
rescinded for the benefit of Parent), each Indemnitor shall make available to
Parent any documents and materials in his, her or its possession or control
that reasonably may be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding; and   

(c) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Legal Proceeding with the written consent of the Shareholder Representative;
provided, however, that such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   

(d) Parent shall give the Shareholder Representative prompt notice of the
commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Company;
provided, however, that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Shareholder Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnitors under this Article IX (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). Parent shall
conduct the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding diligently and in good
faith using all reasonable means and defenses available to it or to the
Company. The Shareholder Representative shall have the right, if it so
notifies Parent with reasonable promptness after receipt of Parents claim
notice, to assist at its own expense and with counsel of its choice (in each
case, consistent with Section 10.2) in the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding by Parent (or in the case of a claim or Legal Proceeding against
the Company, by the Company). In such event, Parent shall afford the
Shareholder Representative and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
comment and the right to object (which right shall not be
unreasonably exercised) with respect to the conduct of the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding. Parent shall keep the Shareholder Representative
reasonably informed of the progress of any claim or Legal Proceeding and its
defense, and shall with reasonable promptness provide the
Shareholder Representative with copies of all material notices, written
communications and filings (including court papers) made by or on behalf of
any of the parties to the underlying claim or Legal Proceeding. Neither
Parent nor any other Indemnitee may settle, adjust or compromise any claim
or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld). If Parent
does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal
Proceeding, the Shareholder Representative may proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. In such case, Parent or such other Indemnitee will cooperate in the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding and will provide reasonable access
to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by
the Shareholder Representative and to all officers, directors and employees
reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative for investigation,
depositions and trial; provided, however, that the Shareholder Representative
may not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding
without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld).

SECTION 10.2 _Shareholder Representative_. Based on the approval and
appointment set forth in the Written Consents, without any further act of any
Shareholder being necessary, Mark Ein hereby accepts its appointment and
agrees to act as the Shareholder Representative for the Indemnitors for
purposes of all matters relating to Article IX hereof and the Escrow
Agreement, including without limitation, the power to execute and deliver the
Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Shareholders. The Shareholders shall be
bound by all actions taken by the Shareholder Representative on all matters
relating to Article IX hereof and the Escrow Agreement, and Parent shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Shareholder Representative on all such
matters and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence
of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed
on behalf of any Shareholder or Indemnitor by the Shareholder Representative
with respect thereto, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken
on behalf of any Shareholder or Indemnitor by the Shareholder Representative
with respect thereto, as fully binding upon such Shareholder or Indemnitor.
If a majority of the Principal Stockholders shall determine to remove the
Shareholders Representative or the Shareholders Representative shall
resign, die, become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill
his responsibilities as agent of the Shareholders and Indemnitors, then the
Shareholders shall, within ten days after such determination to remove, death
or disability, appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter, shall
notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
become the " _Shareholder Representative_ " in accordance with this Section
10.2. If for any reason there is no Shareholder Representative at any time,
all references herein to the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to
refer to the Shareholders. The Shareholder Representative shall be reimbursed
out of the Escrowed Funds for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with serving as the Shareholder Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Shareholder Representative shall at
all times act in his capacity as Shareholder Representative in a manner that
the Shareholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of the
Indemnitors. The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative except for gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of Shareholder
Representative. The Shareholder Representative may consult with legal
counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it.
The Shareholder Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. As to any matters not
expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the
Shareholder Representative shall not exercise any discretion or take any
action. The Shareholders shall severally (but not jointly) indemnify
Shareholder Representative and hold Shareholder Representative harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct on the part of Shareholder Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
Shareholder Representatives duties hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by
Shareholder Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
any Shareholder be liable under this Section 10.2 for any amount in excess of
any consideration actually received in the Merger. This Section 10.2 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.   

SECTION 10.3 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall execute and cause
to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other
documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other party may
reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of
carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the filing by Parent with the SEC of a Registration
Statement on Form S-1.   

SECTION 10.4 _Fees And Expenses_. Subject to Section 10.2, each party hereto
shall bear its own costs, expenses and fees in connection with the
Merger.   

SECTION 10.5 _Attorneys  Fees_. If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought
against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other
relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).   

SECTION 10.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.   

SECTION 10.7 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the
Escrow Agreement, the Written Consents and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise, except that Parent and Sub may assign all or any of their
respective rights and obligations hereunder (i) to any lender providing
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary or subsidiaries of Parent,
provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. Any
attempted assignment which does not comply with the provisions of this
Section 10.7 shall be null and void _ab_ _initio_.   

SECTION 10.8 _Parties in Interest_. Except as expressly set forth herein,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and nothing in this Agreement, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.   

SECTION 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the principles of conflicts of laws.   

SECTION 10.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
