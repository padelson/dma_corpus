BE DONE SO AS TO REDUCE THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ESCROW AGREEMENT.
ANY AMOUNTS REMAINING OUT OF THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT UPON TERMINATION OF THE ESCROW
AGREEMENT SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE INDEMNITORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ESCROW AGREEMENT. THE
AMOUNT OF INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY THE INDEMNITORS TO THE INDEMNITEES FROM THE
INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT SHALL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF (OR IF ALREADY PAID TO THE
INDEMNITEES, PROMPTLY REPAID TO THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW AMOUNT IN THE AMOUNT OF) ANY RECOVERIES
ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE INDEMNITEES UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES OR VIA CONTRIBUTION OR OTHER RELATED
PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIRD PARTIES. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NOTHING IN THIS ARTICLE IX SHALL
BE CONSTRUED OR INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE ANY INDEMNITEE TO FIRST SEEK REIMBURSEMENT OF ANY DAMAGES
INCURRED BY SUCH INDEMNITEE FROM ANY OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNDER ANY INSURANCE
POLICIES. THE INDEMNITEES SHALL TAKE ALL REASONABLE ACTIONS REASONABLY NECESSARY TO MITIGATE ANY
INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH AN INDEMNITY CLAIM MADE PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE IX.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 9.4 <U>No Contribution</U>. No Indemnitor shall have any right of contribution,
right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which she, he or it may become subject under
or in connection with this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 9.5 <U>Defense of Third Party Claims</U>. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against the Company, Parent or
against any other Person) with respect to which any of the Indemnitors may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article&nbsp;IX, Parent
shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding on its own. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal
Proceeding:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Shareholder Representative shall be borne and
paid exclusively from the Escrowed Funds;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;subject to any confidentiality restrictions to which any Indemnitor may be subject
(provided that upon Parent&#146;s request, any such Indemnitor will use its best efforts to have such
confidentiality restrictions waived or rescinded for the benefit of Parent), each Indemnitor shall
make available to Parent any documents and materials in his, her or its possession or control that
reasonably may be necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding
with the written consent of the Shareholder Representative; provided, however, that such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Parent shall give the Shareholder Representative prompt notice of the commencement of any
such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Company; provided, however, that any failure on the
part of Parent to so notify the Shareholder Representative shall not limit any of the obligations
of the Indemnitors under this Article&nbsp;IX (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the defense of such Legal Proceeding). Parent shall conduct the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding diligently and in good faith using all reasonable means and defenses available to it or
to the Company. The Shareholder Representative shall have the right, if it so notifies Parent with
reasonable promptness after receipt of Parent&#146;s claim notice, to assist at its own expense and with
counsel of its choice (in each case, consistent with Section&nbsp;10.2) in the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding by Parent (or in the case of a claim or Legal Proceeding against the Company, by
the Company). In such event, Parent shall afford the Shareholder Representative and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to comment and the right to object (which right shall not be unreasonably
exercised) with respect to the conduct of the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding. Parent
shall keep the Shareholder Representative reasonably informed of the progress of any claim or Legal
Proceeding and its defense, and shall with reasonable promptness provide the Shareholder
Representative with copies of all material notices, written communications and filings (including
court papers) made by or on behalf of any of the parties to the underlying claim or Legal
Proceeding. Neither Parent nor any other Indemnitee may settle, adjust or compromise any claim or
Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative (which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld). If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any
such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Shareholder Representative may proceed with the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent. In such case, Parent or
such other Indemnitee will cooperate in the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding and will
provide reasonable access to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested
by the Shareholder Representative and to all officers, directors and employees reasonably requested
by the Shareholder Representative for investigation, depositions and trial; provided, however, that
the Shareholder Representative may not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld).

forth in the Written Consents, without any further act of any Shareholder being necessary, Mark Ein
hereby accepts its appointment and agrees to act as the Shareholder Representative for the
Indemnitors for purposes of all matters relating to Article&nbsp;IX hereof and the Escrow Agreement,
including without limitation, the power to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement on behalf of
the Shareholders. The Shareholders shall be bound by all actions taken by the Shareholder
Representative on all matters relating to Article&nbsp;IX hereof and the Escrow Agreement, and Parent
shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Shareholder Representative on all such matters and
shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Shareholder or Indemnitor by the
Shareholder Representative with respect thereto, and on any other action taken or purported to be
taken on behalf of any Shareholder or Indemnitor by the Shareholder Representative with respect
thereto, as fully binding upon such Shareholder or Indemnitor. If a majority of the Principal
Stockholders shall determine to remove the Shareholders&#146; Representative or the Shareholders&#146;
Representative shall resign, die, become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his
responsibilities as agent of the Shareholders and Indemnitors, then the Shareholders shall, within
ten days after such determination to remove, death or disability, appoint a successor agent and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor
shall become the &#147;<U>Shareholder Representative</U>&#148; in accordance with this Section&nbsp;10.2. If for
any reason there is no Shareholder Representative at any time, all references herein to the
Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Shareholders. The Shareholder
Representative shall be reimbursed out of the Escrowed Funds for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with serving as the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. The Shareholder Representative shall at all times act in his capacity as
Shareholder Representative in a manner that the Shareholder Representative believes to be in the
best interest of the Indemnitors. The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Representative except for gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct on the part of Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it. The
Shareholder Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance
or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. As to any matters not expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
the Shareholder Representative shall not exercise any discretion or take any action. The
Shareholders shall severally (but not jointly) indemnify Shareholder Representative and hold
Shareholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of Shareholder Representative and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of Shareholder Representative&#146;s
duties hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any
legal counsel retained by Shareholder Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall any Shareholder be liable under this Section&nbsp;10.2 for any amount in excess of any
consideration actually received in the Merger. This Section&nbsp;10.2 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.3 <U>Further Assurances</U>. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and shall take such
other actions, as such other party may reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for
the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the filing by Parent with the SEC of a Registration Statement on Form S-1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.4 <U>Fees And Expenses</U>. Subject to Section&nbsp;10.2, each party hereto shall bear
its own costs, expenses and fees in connection with the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.5 <U>Attorneys&#146; Fees</U>. If any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought against any party hereto, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and disbursements
(in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.6 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible
in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
fullest extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.7 <U>Entire Agreement; Assignment</U>. This Agreement, together with the Escrow
Agreement, the Written Consents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that
Parent and Sub may assign all or any of their respective rights and obligations hereunder (i)&nbsp;to
any lender providing financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)&nbsp;to
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary or subsidiaries of Parent, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not
perform such obligations. Any attempted assignment which does not comply with the provisions of
this Section&nbsp;10.7 shall be null and void <U>ab</U> <U>initio</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.8 <U>Parties in Interest</U>. Except as expressly set forth herein, this

remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts
of laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.10 <U>Headings</U>. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.11 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 10.12 <U>Specific Performance</U>. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
