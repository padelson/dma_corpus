-v-  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

This ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of March 25, 2013,
is by and between Mexichem Specialty Resins Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Purchaser"), and PolyOne Corporation, an Ohio corporation ("Seller").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Seller is engaged in the Business; and

 

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller and Seller desires to sell
to Purchaser, upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set
forth, the property and assets used in or necessary for the operation of the
Business (other than Excluded Assets).

STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 1.01. _Purchased Assets; Excluded Assets._ Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall purchase from Seller,
and Seller shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be
sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, to Purchaser, at the
Closing, the Purchased Assets and all of Sellers right, title and interest
in, to and under the Purchased Assets, free and clear of any and all Liens,
other than Permitted Liens. Purchaser shall not purchase or acquire or
otherwise obtain any right, title or interest in any Excluded Asset, except
for the right to use certain Excluded Assets, solely to the extent provided
under, and in accordance with, the Transaction Agreements.

 

Section 1.02. _Assumed Liabilities; Retained Liabilities._ Effective from and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall assume, and shall thereafter pay, perform
and observe fully and timely, the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not assume, or
cause to be assumed, or be deemed to have assumed or cause to have assumed,
or be liable or responsible for any of the Retained Liabilities.

Section 1.03. _Assignment of Contracts and Rights._ Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Assigned Contract or any claim, right or any benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if and for so long as such
assignment, without the approval, consent or waiver of a third party thereto,
would constitute a breach or other contravention of such Assigned Contract or
in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller thereunder so that Purchaser
would not in fact receive all such rights. If such approval, consent or
waiver is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be
ineffective under the terms of such Assigned Contract or would adversely
affect the rights of Seller thereunder so that Purchaser would not in fact
receive all  such rights, Purchaser and Seller will cooperate, in a mutually agreeable
lawful arrangement designed to provide to Purchaser the economic claims,
rights and benefits and liabilities of use of such Assigned Contract, and
Seller shall continue to perform such Contract or comply with the terms
thereof upon the direction of, and with all necessary help from, Purchaser;
_provided_ , that Purchaser shall bear any incremental economic burden
resulting from implementation of any such alternative arrangement pursuant to
this _Section 1.03_. To the extent, and only to the extent, Purchaser is able
to receive the economic claims, rights and benefits under any
Assigned Contract, Purchaser shall be responsible for the Assumed
Liabilities, if any, arising under such Assigned Contract. Following the
Closing, the parties hereto shall have a continuing obligation to cooperate
with each other and to obtain promptly all such approvals, consents or
waivers; _provided_ , that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain such approvals,
consents, or waivers. Upon obtaining the requisite approval, consent or
waiver, Seller shall promptly convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause
to be conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, such Assigned Contract,
claim, right or benefit to Purchaser hereunder.

Section 1.04. _Purchase Price._ At the Closing, in consideration for
the transfer by Seller to Purchaser of the Purchased Assets, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller an aggregate purchase price of $250,000,000 in cash (the
"Purchase Price"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Seller to Purchaser. The Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment as provided in _Section 1.06_ and _Section
1.07_.

Section 1.05. _Closing and Closing Deliveries._

terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), or at such other date or place as Purchaser and
Seller may agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").
Legal title, equitable title and risk of loss with respect to the Purchased
Assets will transfer to Purchaser at the Closing, which transfer will be

Section 1.06. _Prorations_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, all utility charges and other similar periodic
obligations (other than Taxes, which shall be allocated as provided in
_Section 7.03_), related to the Owned Real Property transferred at the
Closing shall be prorated as of the Closing. Whenever possible, such
prorations shall be based on actual, current payments by Seller, and to the
extent such actual amounts are not available, such prorations shall be
estimated as of the Closing based on actual amounts for the most recent
comparable billing period. When the actual amounts become known, such
prorations shall be recalculated by Purchaser and Seller, and Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, promptly (but not later than ten (10) Business
Days after notice of

 



-4-   payment due) shall make any additional payment or refund so that the correct
prorated amount is paid by each of Purchaser and Seller.

 

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute
with respect to prorations. In the event Purchaser and Seller are unable to
resolve such dispute within fifteen (15) days after the date such dispute
arose, Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage the firm of Deloitte and Touche
LLP (the "Accounting Firm") to resolve such dispute. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event more than fifteen (15) days thereafter, Purchaser
and Seller shall each prepare and submit a presentation detailing each partys
complete statement of proposed resolution of the dispute to the Accounting
Firm. As promptly as practicable, but in no event more than fifteen (15) days
thereafter, Purchaser and Seller shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one
of the parties positions based solely upon the presentations by Purchaser
and Seller. The parties shall share the expenses of the Accounting Firm
equally. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties and may be enforced by a court
of competent venue and jurisdiction. When the determination of the Accounting
Firm becomes final, Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall promptly pay
(but no later than ten (10) Business Days after such determination is made)
the determined amount to the other party.

(c) In the event that any amount due to Seller or Purchaser under this 
_Section 1.06_ is not paid within the time period set forth for payment
above, the payor thereof shall pay interest on such amount due at a rate of
twelve percent (12%) per annum, which shall accrue from the due date for such
payment to the date of actual payment, based on a 360-day year.

Section 1.07. _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Final Working Capital Statement_. Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the other party a working capital statement (each a "Final
Working Capital Statement"), setting forth the Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the "Final Working Capital"). Each Final Working Capital
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles,
practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Target
Working Capital Statement.

 

(b) _Dispute; Final Determination_. Within thirty (30) days following receipt
by each party of the other partys Final Working Capital Statement, (i)
Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of any dispute Seller has
with respect to the preparation or content of Purchasers Final Working
Capital Statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, each item in dispute
and Sellers alternative calculation thereof and (ii) Purchaser shall deliver
written notice to Seller of any dispute Purchaser has with respect to the
preparation or content of Sellers Final Working Capital Statement setting
forth, in reasonable detail, each item in dispute and Purchasers alternative
calculation thereof; provided, however, that neither party may dispute the
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in
preparing the other partys Final Working Capital Statement if they are the
same as the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and

 



-5-   policies used in preparing the Target Working Capital Statement. Any element
of Purchasers Final Working Capital Statement that is not set forth in
Sellers notice shall be treated as accepted by Seller. Any element of
Sellers Final Working Capital Statement that is not set forth in Purchasers
notice shall be treated as accepted by Purchaser. If a party does not notify
the other party of a dispute with respect to the other partys Final Working
Capital Statement within such 30-day period, such other partys Final Working
Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the
event of such notification of a dispute, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and Seller,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within
fifteen (15) days after either party advises the other party of its
objections, then Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage the Accounting
Firm to resolve such dispute. As promptly as practicable, but in no event more
than fifteen (15) days thereafter, each of Purchaser and Seller shall prepare
and submit a presentation detailing such partys complete statement of
proposed resolution of the dispute to the Accounting Firm. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event more than fifteen (15) days thereafter, Purchaser
and Seller shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one of the parties
positions based solely upon the items in dispute and the presentations by
Purchaser and Seller. The parties shall share the expenses of the Accounting
Firm equally. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties and may be enforced by a court of
competent venue and jurisdiction.

(c) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section 1.07_, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the
other party and its respective Representatives all information, records, data
and working papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel,
as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis
of the Final Working Capital Statement and the resolution of any disputes
thereunder. If Purchaser fails to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 1.07(c)_ in connection with preparing the Final Working Capital
Statement following written notice of such failure from Seller, the thirty
(30) day period set forth in _Section 1.07(b)_ shall be extended until the
date that is thirty (30) days following the date of Purchasers compliance
therewith.

 

(d) _Downward Adjustment_. If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to  _Section 1.07(b)_) is less than the Target Working Capital,
then the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of such
shortfall, and Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to
such shortfall to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller. Any
such payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which
the Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.07(b)_.

(e) _Upward Adjustment_. If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_) is greater than the Target Working Capital,
then the Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess,
and Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such
excess to

 



-6-   Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to
be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Final Working
Capital is finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_.

(f)  _Interest_. In the event that any amount due to Purchaser (as a downward
Purchase Price adjustment) or to Seller (as an upward Purchase Price
adjustment) under this _Section 1.07_ is not paid within the time period set
forth for payment above, the payor thereof shall pay interest on such amount
due at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, which shall accrue from the
due date for such payment to the date of actual payment, based on a 360-day
year.

 

Section 1.08. _Allocation of Purchase Price._ The Purchase Price plus any
Assumed Liabilities and all other capitalizable costs shall be allocated
among the Purchased Assets based on the fair market values of the Purchased
Assets immediately prior to the Closing (the "Allocation"), which fair market
values shall be agreed upon by the parties prior to the Closing. The
Allocation shall be consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any analogous provisions of state,
local or non-U.S. Law. Seller and Purchaser hereby covenant and agree to (a)
be bound by the Allocation for all purposes, including Tax and financial
accounting purposes, (b) report, act, prepare and file Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with the Allocation, (c) adopt and utilize the Allocation
for purposes of filing any applicable Tax forms (including IRS Form 8594),
and (d) take no position inconsistent with the Allocation before any
Governmental Authority or otherwise for Tax purposes, unless required by
applicable Law. Each of the parties shall notify the other if any
Governmental Authority proposes to reallocate the Purchase Price and no party
will agree to any adjustment asserted by such Governmental Authority without
the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

electrical, air conditioning and plumbing systems, are generally in good
operating condition and in a state of good maintenance and repair (having
regard to its age and subject to ordinary wear and tear). To the Knowledge of
Seller, Sellers Owned Real Property and its continued use, occupancy and
operation as currently used, occupied and operated does not constitute a
nonconforming use under any Law or Governmental Order affecting the real
property (other than possible set back violations, none of which has had or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect), and the continued existence, use, occupancy
and operation of each Improvement, and the right and ability to repair and/or
rebuild such Improvements in the event of casualty, is not dependent on any
special Permit, exception, approval or variance. There is no pending, or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened proceeding or Governmental Authority
action to modify the zoning classification of, or to take by the power of

way the right to use, develop or alter, all or any part of the Owned Real
Property which has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. There are no encroachments
upon any of the Owned Real Property, and no portion of any Improvement owned
by Seller encroaches upon any property not included within the Owned Real
Property or upon the area of any easement affecting Sellers Owned
Real Property. Each Improvement has direct access, adequate for the operation
of the Business, in the ordinary course, to a public street adjoining Sellers
real property on which such Improvement is situated, and no existing way of
access to any Improvement crosses or encroaches upon any property or property
interest not owned by Seller.

tenant) with respect to any real property used primarily in the Business.

judgment, decree or agreement that restricts the use of any Purchased
Intellectual Property or that would impair the validity or enforceability
thereof. To the Knowledge of Seller, the conduct of the Business and the use
of the Purchased Intellectual Property does not infringe, misappropriate or
violate any Intellectual Property of any Person. Except as set forth on
_Section 2.13(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there is no litigation,
opposition, cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim pending, asserted
or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened against Seller or any of its Affiliates
concerning the ownership, validity, registerability, enforceability,

otherwise transfers the Person or assets engaged in the Business to a Person
other than Seller or any of its Affiliates within twelve (12) months of the
date on which such acquisition is consummated.

_Section 4.05_ shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this
_Section 4.05_ shall be deemed amended to delete therefrom such provision or
portion adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such amendment to apply
only with respect to the operation of this  _Section 4.05_ in the particular
jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.

significant portion of the Purchased Assets, or (iii) any other transaction

which has substantially similar economic effects, in each such case, in which
transaction Purchaser does not participate. Seller will not vote its capital
stock or the capital stock of any of its subsidiaries in favor of any
Alternate Transaction. Seller will notify Purchaser as soon as practicable if
any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry to, or contact with, Seller
with respect to an Alternate Transaction and shall describe in reasonable
detail the identity of any such Person and, the substance and material terms
of any such contact and the material terms of any such proposal.

shall cause each of its Affiliates, and shall direct each of their respective
Representatives, to terminate any existing discussion or negotiations with any
Persons, other than Purchaser (and its Affiliates and Representatives),
concerning any Alternate Transaction. Seller shall, and shall direct its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, request the return

COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

 

Section 5.01. _Confidentiality_. Prior to the Closing and after any
termination of this Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates will hold, and
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence, all Confidential Information (which
term, for purposes of this _Section 5.01_, shall be deemed to include all
information that Seller has furnished to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements), except to the extent that such information can be
shown to have been (a) in the public domain prior to the execution of this
Agreement, (b) in the public domain through no fault of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives or (c) later lawfully acquired by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from sources other than Seller or
its Affiliates or Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may
disclose Confidential Information to its Representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements so long as such Representatives are informed by Purchaser of the
nature of the Confidential Information and are directed by Purchaser to hold
such in confidence, and Purchaser shall be responsible for any breach of the
confidentiality provisions of this _Section 5.01_ by its Affiliates and
Representatives (including Representatives of Seller who, after the date
hereof, become Representatives of Purchaser). The obligation of Purchaser and
its Affiliates to hold the Confidential Information in confidence prior to the
Closing and after any termination of this Agreement shall be satisfied if they
exercise the same care with respect to Confidential Information as they would
take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar information in the
ordinary course of business. If this Agreement is terminated, Purchaser and
its Affiliates will, and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, destroy or deliver to Seller, upon
request, all Confidential Information and related materials, and all copies
thereof, obtained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives or
on behalf of any of the foregoing from Seller or any of its Representatives
in connection with this Agreement. If, prior to the Closing or after any
termination of this Agreement, Purchaser or any of its Representatives are
legally required to disclose any Confidential Information, Purchaser shall
(i) promptly notify Seller to permit Seller, at its expense, to seek a
protective order or take other appropriate action and (ii) cooperate as
reasonably requested by Seller in Sellers efforts to obtain a protective
order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such Confidential Information, but only at Sellers sole cost and
expense. If, prior to the Closing or after any termination of this Agreement,
in the absence of a protective order, Purchaser or any of its Representatives
is compelled as a matter of Law to disclose Confidential Information to a
third party, Purchaser and its Representatives may disclose to the third party
compelling disclosure only the part of such Confidential Information as is
required by Law to be disclosed; _provided_ ,

 



-28-    _however_ , that, prior to any such disclosure, Purchaser and its
Representatives will use good faith efforts to advise and consult with Seller
and its counsel as to such disclosure and the nature and wording of such
disclosure.

Section 5.02. _Contractual Overpayments_. If, at any time following
the Closing, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives a refund amount or a

of such refund or reduction.

Section 5.03. _Releases under Certain Contracts_.

procure the release by the applicable counterparty of any continuing
obligation of Seller with respect to any Assigned Contract.

expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, following the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall execute

(30th) calendar day from the date hereof, definitively determine whether any
other Antitrust Laws are applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby
and, promptly following such determination, shall make all required filings
and notices under such other applicable Antitrust Laws (collectively with all
required filings under the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Filings"). Purchaser and
Seller shall consult and cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Antitrust Filings, and each shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority regarding
any Antitrust Filing. Each party shall review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with
any proposed written or material oral communication with any Governmental
Authority concerning any Antitrust Filing. Neither party shall participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Authority unless it first consults with the
other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by the Governmental
Authority, gives such other party the

 



-29-   opportunity to be present thereat. Neither party shall agree to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the prior
written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each of Purchaser and Seller shall be
responsible for its own filing fees required to be paid in connection with any
Antitrust Filing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the making of the Antitrust Filings, neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall be required to commit to any divestitures, licenses, or hold separate
or similar agreements with respect to assets or conduct of business
arrangements as a condition to obtaining any approvals from any Governmental
Authority.

 

Section 6.03. _Certain Filings._ Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with one
another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing

taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 6.04. _Public Announcements._ From the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements shall be issued
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives without the prior
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be issued by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives without the prior consent of Purchaser (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except, in each case,
as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules,
regulations or policies of any United States or foreign securities exchange,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller may make internal announcements
regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements to its employees after reasonable prior notice to, and consultation
with, Purchaser.

(a) With respect to any Owned Real Property, Purchaser shall either (i) remove
all interior and exterior signage with respect to such Owned Real Property

Intellectual Property that constitutes a Purchased Asset or will be licensed
under the Geon Trademark License Agreement) (collectively, the "Tradenames and
Trademarks") or (ii) cover such signage with temporary signage or other opaque
materials not bearing any Tradename and Trademark so that no part of the

to (i) sell existing Inventory and (ii) use existing packaging, labeling,
containers, stationery, business forms, supplies, advertising and promotional
materials and any similar materials bearing the Tradenames and Trademarks for
one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action that
could reasonably be expected to impair the value of the Tradenames and
Trademarks; provided further, however, that when using the items listed in
clause (ii) above in the context of entering into or conducting contractual
relationships, Purchaser shall make clear to all other applicable parties that
Purchaser, rather than Seller, is the party entering into or conducting the
contractual relationship; _provided further, however_ , that personnel of
Purchaser or its Affiliates using the above items shall have no authority to
hold themselves out as officers, employees or agents of Seller. Seller and
its Affiliates agree not to commence any Action based on infringement or
misappropriation or other violation of Intellectual Property rights against
Purchaser or its Affiliates or their employees, contractors, licensees or
agents in connection with their proper exercise of the rights granted
pursuant to this _Section 6.05(b)_, so long as Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their employees, contractors, licensees and agents comply with all applicable
Laws in any use of packaging or labeling containing the Tradenames and
Trademarks, and so long as Purchaser, its Affiliates and their employees,
contractors, licensees and agents do not alter in any manner the Intellectual
Property embodied in the existing Inventory or the existing packaging,
labeling, containers, stationery, business forms, supplies, advertising and
promotional materials or any similar materials.

(c) With respect to _Section 6.05(b)_, Purchaser shall use commercially

(d) Unless otherwise provided in any Transaction Agreement or agreed in
writing by Purchaser, as of and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates
shall, and shall cause its sublicensees to, as soon as practicable but in no
event later than one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing: (i)

names, Domain Names, email addresses, websites and advertising keywords), and
(ii) remove all links to Domain Names or websites owned by Purchaser or its
Affiliates from their websites and, without limiting any of Purchasers other
rights or remedies, return all materials bearing or embodying the Purchased
Intellectual Property to Purchaser, unless instructed in writing to destroy or
delete them by Purchaser.

 

Section 6.06. __Notices of Certain Events_. _From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, each party shall promptly notify the other party of:

necessary to comply with ISRA as it applies to the sale of the Purchased
Assets pursuant to this Agreement, and as it applies to Sellers obligations
under existing ISRA case number E93605.

(b) Purchaser hereby grants to Seller and its consultants and contractors the
right to enter upon the Owned Real Property upon reasonable advance notice in
order to perform or monitor the work necessary for Seller to comply with its
ISRA obligations. Seller shall take commercially reasonable steps to avoid
unreasonably interfering with the operations of Purchaser at the Owned Real
Property. If any portion of the Owned Real Property suffers any material
damage caused by Seller or its consultants or contractors pursuant to this
access, including damage arising from sampling or testing conducted at the
Owned Real Property, Seller shall reasonably repair such damage and restore
the Owned Real Property substantially to the condition that existed
immediately prior to such damage. If Purchaser transfers all or any portion of
the Owned Real Property subject to ISRA to any other Person, Purchaser shall
require such other Person to (x) grant to Seller the same right of access set
forth in this _Section 6.07(b)_, and (y) further require any future
transferee of any portion of the Owned Real Property to grant to Seller the
same right of access set forth in this _Section 6.07(b)_.

(c) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller to minimize costs
incurred by Seller associated with Sellers ISRA obligations, and Purchaser
shall accept any Land Use Covenants and/or Land Use Restrictions and shall
execute and record any deed notices and accept any Classification Exception
Area designation for groundwater and otherwise execute and record all
appropriate documents in connection therewith as Seller may request; provided,
however, that such covenants, restrictions, and designations do not materially
interfere with the continued utilization of the Owned Real Property for
industrial uses as occurring and situated/configured at the time of Closing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) Sellers obligations
under this  _Section 6.07_ to the extent triggered by the sale of Purchased
Assets pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon receipt of a written
notice from a Governmental Authority indicating no further action is required
(which notice may include a remediation in progress waiver), the issuance of
a response action outcome ("RAO"), or the receipt of any equivalent notice
from a licensed site remediation professional and (ii) Sellers obligations
under this  _Section 6.07_

 



-32-   with respect to existing ISRA case number E93605 shall terminate upon the
issuance of an RAO or no further action notice.

 

(e) If any such RAO, no further action notice or any equivalent notice
referenced in _Section 6.07(d)_ requires future monitoring, maintenance,
reporting, and/or other requirements, including in connection with any Land
Use Covenants and/or Land Use Restrictions, Remedial Action Permit or
Classification Exception Area designation, then such monitoring, maintenance,
reporting, and/or other requirements (excluding remediation), including in
connection with any Land Use Covenants and/or Land Use Restrictions, Remedial
Action Permit or Classification Exception Area designation, shall be performed
by the Purchaser at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and Purchaser shall
promptly provide Seller with copies of all submittals and correspondence with
any Governmental Authority relating thereto.

 

(f) To the extent Purchaser or any of its agents, contractors, licensees or
invitees (other than Seller and its contractors and agents) contributes to or
exacerbates releases of or contamination by Hazardous Substances, or otherwise
undertakes any construction, demolition or other actions which increase
Sellers cost to comply with ISRA relative to conditions existing as of the

to comply with ISRA within ten (10) Business Days of receiving an invoice from
Seller.

opportunity of no less than ten (10) Business Days to review and comment upon
the form and substance of any reports, certifications or material
correspondence with the United States or State of Illinois concerning the
Consent Decree, and Purchaser shall incorporate Sellers reasonable comments
as are necessary to comply with the Consent Decree.

 

(d) Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser concerning any requests
by Purchaser to modify or terminate the Consent Decree following the Closing.

beginning the date that is two (2) months after the date of this Agreement
(but in any event no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the

or amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter relating

 



-33-   to Sellers representations and warranties made under _Article 2_ arising

Closing Date, (ii) have a principal place of employment at a location within
the United States, and (iii) for the one-year period commencing on the Closing
Date, be entitled to receive, in

 



-37-   each case as applicable, (A) the same base salary or hourly base wage rate
as in effect for such Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; (B) an
annual cash target bonus opportunity that is at least equal to the annual
cash target bonus opportunity in effect for such Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date, subject to terms and conditions substantially similar to
those in effect for similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates; and (C) employee benefits (including retirement benefits) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits (including
retirement benefits, but excluding any defined benefit pension or equity-
based benefits or compensation) made available to such Employee by Seller and
its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Purchaser,
or the applicable Affiliate, will cause each written offer to include
any such other terms and conditions as are necessary to ensure that Seller
shall incur no Liability whatsoever under the federal Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or analogous state or local Law or any severance
plan or arrangement maintained by Seller and applicable to the Employees.

(c) Purchaser shall comply with any and all Laws governing employment
discrimination and employment relations in connection with its hiring
processes and procedures for the employment of the Transferred Employees.

Section 8.02. _Purchaser Benefit Plans._

(a) Purchaser shall cause all plans and programs of Purchaser and its
Affiliates in which Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate after
the Closing to recognize all service of the Transferred Employees with Seller
or any of its predecessors and Affiliates to the same extent as such service
was counted under similar benefit plans of Seller or any of its predecessors
and Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for
purposes of determining severance, vacation, sickness and personal days or
paid time off provided by Purchaser, except that no such credit shall be given
for purposes of determining benefit accruals under any pension, retirement or
deferred compensation plans of Purchaser, and in no event shall any credit be
given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the
same period of service. For each self-funded medical, dental or health benefit
plan of Purchaser, Purchaser shall cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, exclusion, and waiting period with respect to participation and
coverage under any such health benefit plan in which such Transferred
Employees (or the eligible dependants thereof) may be eligible to participate
after the Closing and give effect, in determining any deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Transferred Employees (or the eligible dependants
thereof) during the applicable plan year of the applicable Employee Plan in
which such transfer occurs, _provided_ , that Seller provides the necessary
data to Purchaser as soon as practicable following Closing; _provided,
further_ that such Transferred Employees and dependents were enrolled in
comparable Seller Employee Plans immediately prior to the Closing; _provided,
however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits. To the extent that Purchaser maintains any fully
insured medical, dental or health benefit plan, Purchaser shall obtain the
agreement of any applicable insurance carrier under the relevant insurance
contract for each health benefit 

 



-38-   plan of Purchaser in which the Transferred Employees become participants to
comply with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Purchaser shall (i) credit each Transferred Employee with the unused
vacation, sick leave or personal days to which the Transferred Employee is
entitled through the Closing Date to the extent that (x) Seller shall have
disclosed to Purchaser such unused vacation, sick leave or personal days prior
to the Closing Date, and (y) an adjustment in favor of Purchaser is made
pursuant to _Section 1.07_ for the aggregate amount of the Liability
represented by such unused vacation, sick leave or personal days, and (ii)
ensure that such vacation, sick leave or personal days are not subject to
forfeiture to the same extent not subject to forfeiture under the applicable
Employee Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that if Seller shall be required by applicable Law to pay
any Transferred Employee the cash value of his or her unused vacation, sick
leave or personal days described in this _Section 8.02(b)_ because of a
failure of Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this clause (b),
then Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the amount so paid by Seller and
shall not be required to honor such vacation, sick leave or personal days.

(c) Purchaser shall have the sole responsibility for "continuation coverage"
benefits for all Transferred Employees and "qualified beneficiaries" of
Transferred Employees for whom a "qualifying event" occurs after the Closing
Date. Seller shall retain any such responsibility with respect to all
Employees (or other employees of Seller and its Affiliates) and their
"qualified beneficiaries" who do not become Transferred Employees and for all
Transferred Employees and "qualified beneficiaries" of Transferred Employees
for whom a "qualifying event" occurs before or on the Closing Date. The terms
"continuation coverage," "qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying event"
shall have the meanings ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the Code and
Sections 601-608 of ERISA.

 

(d) Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement: (i) Purchaser shall
not be obligated to assume, continue or maintain any of the Employee Plans;
(ii) no assets or liabilities of the Employee Plans shall be transferred to,
or assumed by, Purchaser or Purchasers benefit plans; and (iii) Seller and
its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for funding and/or paying any
benefits under any of the Employee Plans or any other benefit or compensation
plans maintained by Seller or its Affiliates, including any incentive
compensation, equity compensation, termination benefits and other employee
entitlements accrued or payable under such plans.

Section 8.03. _Workers  Compensation Claims_. As of the Closing, Purchaser
shall (i) assume and become solely responsible for any and all workers
compensation claims of any Transferred Employee (including (A) injuries that
relate entirely to an accident that occurred or injury that was identifiably
sustained on or before the Closing Date, regardless of whether such claims are
filed by such Transferred Employee before or after the Closing Date, (B)
injuries identifiably sustained by Transferred Employees after the
Closing Date that are aggravations or reinjuries of injuries or illnesses
that were sustained on or before the Closing Date and (C) treatment after the
Closing Date required by Transferred Employees following complete recovery
from injuries sustained on or before the Closing Date) and (ii) establish and

 



-39-   maintain appropriate workers compensation insurance with respect to claims
relating to Transferred Employees. Seller shall retain responsibility for any
workers compensation claims of any Employees (or other employees of Seller
and its Affiliates) who do not become Transferred Employees.

Section 8.04.  _W-2 Matters._ Pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-53,
Purchaser and Seller shall apply the "standard" method for purposes of
employee payroll reporting with respect to Transferred Employees for the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

Section 8.05. _No Third Party Beneficiaries; Enforcement._ The provisions of
this _Article 8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and no Employee or current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary to this Agreement. Nothing in this _Article 8_ , express or
implied, shall: (a) give rise to any rights, claims, benefits, causes of
action or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any period or terms of employment, of any nature whatsoever, to any
Employee, any representative of any such Employee, or any third party
whatsoever (including any Governmental Authority), (b) subject to _Section
8.01_ and _Section 8.02_, be interpreted to prevent or restrict Purchaser or
its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any Transferred Employee, including the amendment or termination
of any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement,
after the Closing Date or (c) be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan or
arrangement.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION

Section 10.01. _Grounds for Termination. _ This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the one (1) year
anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date") solely as
a result of the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 9.01(a)_ to be
satisfied or waived; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to
the party seeking to terminate if any action of such party or the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to
be performed at or prior to the Closing has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date and
such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of this Agreement; or

 

(ii) any court or other Governmental Authority shall have issued, enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced any Law or Governmental Order (that is final
and non-appealable and that has not been vacated, withdrawn or overturned)
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated

cured prior to the earlier of (i) twenty (20) Business Days following notice
of such breach and (ii) the day that is five (5) Business Days prior to the

available to the party seeking to terminate if any action of such party or the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement

resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Drop Dead
Date and such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of this

termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 10.01(b)(ii)_, or
by Seller pursuant to _Section 10.01(c) _

 



-43-   (solely as a result of Purchasers failure to satisfy its obligations

harmless Purchaser and its officers, directors and Affiliates (collectively,
the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from and against any Covered Losses
suffered by any such Purchaser Indemnified Parties resulting from or arising
out of: (i) failure of any representation or warranty of Seller in _Article
2_ hereof to be true and correct in all respects (without giving effect to any
"material", "materially", "Material Adverse Effect", "material
adverse effect", or similar qualification contained in any such
representation or warranty except for those appearing in all capitalized text,
the term "Material Contract" or those contained in _Section 2.05_ and 
_Section 2.06_) on and as of the date of this Agreement and on and as of the
Closing Date as if made on such date (other than those made on a specified
date, which shall be true and correct in all respects as of such specified
date); (ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made

 



-44-   by Seller in this Agreement that survives the Closing Date pursuant to
_Section 11.01(b)_; (iii) any Retained Liability; and (iv) any Taxes related
to the Business or the Purchased Assets for Pre-Closing Periods, any Taxes
imposed on Seller and any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is liable in
accordance with _Section 7.04(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties

terminate until the full performance of the relevant covenants in accordance
with their terms.

 

(b) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification claim pursuant to  _Section 11.02(a)(i)_ with respect to
misrepresentations of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
Seller in _Article 2_ hereof after the expiration of the applicable survival
period pursuant to  _Section 11.01(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, on
or prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of
claim shall have been given to Seller in accordance with _Section 11.04_ for
such indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall continue to
have the right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim
until such claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved
as provided in this  _Article 11_.

(c) Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this 
_Section 11.02_ shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of
immediately available funds from Seller to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party to Seller within
fifteen (15) days after the final determination thereof. In the event Seller
does not pay any amount payable under this _Section 11.02_ within the time
period set forth above, Seller shall pay interest on such amount due at a rate
of twelve percent (12%) per annum, which shall accrue from the due date for
such payment to the date of actual payment, based on a 360-day year.

Section 11.03. _Indemnification of Seller by Purchaser._

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and save and
hold harmless Seller and its officers, directors and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any Covered
Losses suffered by any such Seller Indemnified Parties resulting from or
arising out of: (i) failure of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in _Article 3_ hereof to be true and correct in all respects
(without giving effect to any "material adverse effect," or similar
qualification contained in any such representation or warranty) on and as of
the date of this Agreement and on and as of the Closing Date as if made on
such date (other than those made on a specified date, which shall be true and
correct in all respects as of such specified date); (ii) any nonfulfillment or
breach of any covenant or agreement made by Purchaser in this Agreement that
survives the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 11.01(b)_; and (iii) any
Assumed Liability. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchasers obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to clause
(ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall not terminate until the full
performance of the relevant covenants in accordance with their terms.

 



-45-  (b) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert
any indemnification claim in accordance with _Section 11.03(a)(i) _with
respect to misrepresentations of or inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Purchaser in Article 3 hereof after the expiration of the
applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 11.01(a)_; _provided,
however_ , that if on or prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period, a notice of claim shall have been given to Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 11.04_ for such indemnification, the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall continue to have the right to be indemnified with respect to such
indemnification claim until such claim for indemnification has been satisfied
or otherwise resolved as provided in this  _Article 11_.

(c) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this 
_Section 11.03_ shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of

Purchaser does not pay any amount payable under this _Section 11.03_ within
the time period set forth above, Purchaser shall pay interest on such amount
due at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, which shall accrue from the
due date for such payment to the date of actual payment, based on a 360-day
year.

Section 11.04. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification._

 

(a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this _Article 11_ in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim or demand made by any Person (other than a party hereto or
Affiliate thereof) against the indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (a "Claims
Notice"), and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt by such indemnified party of written
notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to
provide a Claims Notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party shall deliver
to the indemnifying party, within ten (10) Business Days after the indemnified
partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses by notifying the indemnified party in writing within
forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the applicable Claims Notice, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party
and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; _provided_ , that if the
answer period applicable to such Third-Party Claim is less than forty-five
(45) days, the indemnified party may begin such defense prior to the
expiration of the foregoing forty-five (45) day period. In the event that the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance
with this _Section 11.04(b)_, for the ninety (90) day period following its
receipt of the applicable

 



-46-   Claims Notice (the "Discovery Period"), the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to reasonable discovery with respect to the indemnifiable nature of
the Third-Party Claim. The indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall
reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to such discovery. If the
indemnifying party does not provide written notice to the indemnified party by
the end of the Discovery Period that it no longer desires to assume the
defense of the Third-Party Claim, the claims included in that Third-Party
Claim will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement as
within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder. If
the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this _Section 11.04(b)_, the indemnified party may continue
to defend the Third-Party Claim at the expense of the indemnifying party to
the extent the Third-Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder. Should the
indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof, unless the Third-Party Claim involves potential conflicts
of interest between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party. If the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate
from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that
the indemnifying party shall control such defense. Notwithstanding anything in
the foregoing to the contrary, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the indemnified party if (i) such Third-Party Claim is reasonably
foreseeable to result in Covered Losses which are more than one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the amount indemnifiable by such indemnifying party pursuant
to this  _Section 11.04_; (ii) such Third-Party Claim for indemnification
relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (iii) such Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the indemnified party (other than
immaterial equitable claims that are ancillary to a claim for monetary
damages); or (iv) upon petition by the indemnified party, the appropriate
court rules that the indemnifying party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim (or the indemnified party does so
pursuant to this _Section 11.04_). The indemnifying party shall be liable for
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any
period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim,
all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
partys request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and the
use of reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided, however_ , that if the indemnifying party does not notify

 



-47-   the indemnified party within ten (10) days after the receipt of the
indemnified partys notice of a Third Party Claim of indemnity hereunder that
it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have
the right to contest, settle or compromise the Third Party Claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The
indemnifying party may pay, settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim without
the written consent of the indemnified party, so long as such settlement
includes (i) an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all

fully indemnified in connection therewith), (ii) does not subject the
indemnified party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and
(iii) does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

respect to a Third-Party Claim regarding Taxes, (i) Seller has the right to
control the defense of such claim only if it solely relates to Taxes (x)

Date or (y) imposed solely on Seller and (ii) neither Seller nor Purchaser
shall settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the other

other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which
one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by
making commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim

commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or
liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained
herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any
Covered Losses that would reasonably be expected to have been avoided if

Section 11.06. _Access to Information and Effect on Remedies._  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that it and its Representatives have been permitted
full and complete access to the books and records, facilities, Equipment, Tax

independent investigation and verification and the representations and
warranties expressly and specifically set forth in _Article 2_. The

_Article 2_ constitute the sole and exclusive representations, warranties, and
statements of any kind of Seller or any other Person in connection with the

agrees that all other representations, warranties, and statements of any kind
or nature express or implied (including any relating to the future or
historical financial condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or
liabilities of the Business, or the quality, quantity or condition of the
Purchased Assets) are specifically disclaimed. Purchaser acknowledges that (i)
neither Seller nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the

regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
furnished or made available to Purchaser and its Representatives, except as

management presentations or in any other form in expectation or contemplation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges that, should
the Closing occur, Purchaser shall acquire the Purchased Assets without any
representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose, in an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the right to indemnification,
reimbursement or other remedy based upon any representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, shall not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based upon the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

(b) In connection with the investigation by Purchaser of the Business,
the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser has received or
may receive from Seller certain projections, forward-looking statements and
other forecasts and certain business plan information. Purchaser acknowledges
that there are uncertainties

 



-49-   inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other
forecasts and plans, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that
Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that
Purchaser shall neither have nor make any claim against anyone with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller nor any other
Person makes any representation, warranty, or other statement with respect to,
and Purchaser is not relying on, such estimates, projections, forecasts or
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

purposes of determining the amount of any such Covered Loss. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the limitations set forth in this _Section
11.07(a)_ shall not apply to Covered Losses incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in connection with or arising from any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller in _Section 2.01 _(Organization),

of Assets) or _Section 2.21_ (Finders; Brokers).

remedy of the parties hereto following the Closing for any losses arising out
of any misrepresentation or breach of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement, except for

furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby waives and
releases, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the other party
hereto (including such partys respective Affiliates), arising under or based
upon any Law, other than the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article
11_.

 

Section 11.09. _Subrogation_. After any indemnification payment is made
pursuant to this _Article 11_ , the indemnifying party shall, to the extent
of such payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the indemnified party
against any third party in connection with the Covered Losses to which such
payment relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
any indemnified party receiving an indemnification payment shall execute, upon
the written request of the indemnifying party, any instrument reasonably
necessary to evidence such subrogation rights.

 

Section 11.10. _Environmental Indemnification_ _Exclusive Remedy and
Limitations_. Purchaser understands and agrees that each Purchaser

11.02(a)(i)_ for breach of the representations and warranties contained in

any environmental, health, or safety matter relating to the past, current, or
future facilities, properties, or operations of Seller, the Business or the
Purchased Assets and all of their predecessors or Affiliates (as applicable),
including any such matter arising under any Environmental Law. Except for
Purchasers right to seek indemnification for any Covered Losses for which
Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to _Section 11.02_,
Purchaser hereby waives any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to
seek contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy
from Seller or any of its Affiliates, and hereby releases Seller and its
Affiliates from any claim, demand or liability, in each case with respect to
any such environmental, health, or safety matter (including any arising under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42
U.S.C. § 9601 et seq. and any other Environmental Laws). Seller shall have no
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to

sampling or testing is (w) required by Environmental Law or (x) required to
be conducted in response to any third-party claim, action, suit or proceeding
alleging that Hazardous Substances have migrated offsite from land, buildings
or improvements belonging to the Business. Sellers obligation to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any Covered Losses arising
from conditions of contamination shall be limited to investigatory, corrective
or remedial action required by Environmental Law assuming continued

requested by Seller, execute and record any Land Use Covenants or Land Use
Restrictions employed in connection with Sellers obligations to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any Covered Losses arising
from conditions of contamination, provided that such Land Use Covenants or
Land Use Restrictions shall not materially interfere with the continued
utilization of the Owned Real Property for industrial uses as occurring and
situated/configured as of the Closing.

Section 11.11. _Dispute Resolution_. Each party agrees to submit monetary
claims, disputes, controversies, or other matters in question arising out of
the matters covered by this _Article 11_ ("Disputes") to an independent
expert appointed in accordance with this _Section 11.11_ (the "Independent
Expert"), who shall serve as sole mediator for non-binding mediation. The
Independent Expert shall be appointed by mutual agreement of Seller and
Purchaser from among candidates with experience and expertise in the area that
is the subject of such Dispute. If Disputes to be resolved by the parties with
assistance of the Independent Expert are not resolved to the satisfaction of
both parties within forty-five (45) days after appointment of the Independent
Expert, then either party may immediately terminate such non-binding mediation
and may seek relief in accordance with  _Article 12_ with respect to such
Disputes. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne
equally by the parties. For the avoidance of doubt, any Disputes resolved in
writing between Seller and Purchaser within such forty-five (45) day period
shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder, however,
the Independent Expert shall not be authorized to resolve finally any Disputes
between the parties and no determination of the Independent Expert shall
resolve any Dispute, be binding on the parties or be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
