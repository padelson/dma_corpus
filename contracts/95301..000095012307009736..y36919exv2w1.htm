 SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Co, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of (i) class A common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Class A Common Stock_") and (ii) class B common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Class B Common Stock_" and together with the Class A Common Stock, the " _Company Common Stock_ "; all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive $175.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger_  

    ##### 

  

    

 _Consideration_ "), payable upon surrender in the manner provided in Section
2.02 of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent and Merger Co-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock and each share of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ " and together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ ") held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or Merger Co immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. Each share of Company Capital Stock owned by any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company, Merger Co or Parent (other than Merger Co), if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof. 

   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Co_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Co issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Co common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

   

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At the Closing and immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available).   ##### 

  

  

  

Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate representing such Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 (c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. 

   

 (d) _Exchange Fund for Dissenting Shares_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a) to pay for Shares that become Dissenting Shares shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand following the filing of a petition for appraisal of the Shares with the Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholders rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_"). 

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not   ##### 

  

  

  

theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable
for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Co or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Merger Co shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Co, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Co, as the case may be. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

   

 SECTION 2.03. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Merger Co for any reason shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). 

  

 SECTION 2.04. _Options_. Except as separately agreed in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and the holder of any option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any plan arrangement or agreement (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), each Company Stock Option which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Co, the Company or the holder 

   ##### 

  

    

thereof, be converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, with respect to each share subject thereto, equal to
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ") and each Company Stock Option shall
be canceled at the Effective Time. The payment of the Option Merger
Consideration to the holder of a Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any
income or employment tax withholding required under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company Stock Option. The
Company agrees to take any and all actions necessary (including any action
reasonably requested by Parent) to effectuate immediately prior to the
Effective Time the cancellation of all Company Stock Options that are
eligible for the Option Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.04. 

  

 SECTION 2.05. _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Any such stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Dissenting Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn, in accordance with Section 262, or lost such stockholders rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.02(b). 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

   

ARTICLE III. 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  

  

 Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery with this Agreement by the Company, the Company is delivering to Parent and Merger Co the company schedules (the " _Company Schedules_ "). The disclosure included in any section or subsection of the Company  

  ##### 

  

    

Schedules shall qualify the corresponding section or subsection of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Article III,
whether or not reference is made to the Company Schedules in such section or
subsection of this Article III, and each other section and subsection of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Article
III to the extent that such disclosure is made with such specificity that it
is reasonably apparent solely from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure would qualify the representation and warranty in such
other section or subsection. The disclosure of any matter in the Companys
annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, the
Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March
31, 2007, the Companys definitive proxy statement with respect to its annual

Company with the SEC after March 16, 2007 (in each case to the extent such
form, report, statement, exhibit or schedule is publicly available on EDGAR
as of the date hereof), shall be deemed to qualify any section or subsection
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article
III to the extent that it is reasonably apparent solely from the face of such
disclosure that it would qualify such section or subsection. Nothing in the
Company Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any representation,
warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Schedules shall not be deemed to
be an admission or an acknowledgement, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material to
the Company or has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and
Merger Co as follows:

 _Agreement_ ") as a result of the consummation of the Merger or any other

made to any Current or former employee or consultant of the Company or any
Subsidiary under any employment, severance or termination agreement, other
compensation arrangement or employee benefit plan or arrangement with the
Company or any Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to result in

Code. There are no contracts or arrangements that provide for a tax gross-up

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 6.04(a) , during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on August 23, 2007 (the " _Solicitation Period End Date_ "), the Company and the Company Representatives shall be permitted to (under the direction of the Company Board or the Transaction Committee): (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) directly or indirectly participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, and, subject to the prior execution by the relevant Person of a confidentiality agreement on terms not materially more favorable to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, furnish to any Person information with respect to the Company, and (iii) take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company or any Subsidiary that is provided to such Person which was not previously provided to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), if prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any Person, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of Section 6.04(a), or in response to a bona fide solicited Acquisition Proposal which was permitted by Section 6.04(b), the Company Board or the Transaction Committee determines in good faith, (i) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, the Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal, subject to compliance with this Section 6.04, and after giving notice to Parent (x) furnish (or, with respect to a bona fide solicited Acquisition Proposal which was made prior to the Solicitation Period End Date and which was permitted by Section 6.04(b), continue to furnish) information with respect to the Company and access to properties, books, records and personnel to the Person who has made such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that all such material non-public information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate (or, with respect to a bona fide solicited Acquisition Proposal which was made prior to the Solicitation Period End Date and which was permitted by Section 6.04(b), continue to participate) in discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, (in each case within two business days of receipt thereof) specifying the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal. In the event that any such party thereafter modifies its Acquisition Proposal in any material respect, the Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing within one business day of receipt of such modification of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been modified. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and other information and shall promptly (and in any event 

    ##### 

  

    

within two business days thereafter) notify Parent of the identity of any
Person with which the Company enters into such a confidentiality
agreement. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.04 by any Company Representative, acting on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.04
by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_
" means any proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and
its Affiliates) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of
20% or more of the assets, net revenues or net income of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of the Company Common
Stock or any other class of equity securities of the Company then
outstanding, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the Company Common
Stock or any other class of equity securities of the Company then
outstanding, and any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the transactions described on Section 6.04(c) of the Company Schedules;
_provided, however,_  subject to the Companys compliance with Section
5.01(e) prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the sale by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of all or
any portion of the equity securities or substantially all of the assets of
any Subsidiary of the Company listed on Section 6.04(c) of the Company
Schedules, and any proposal or offer regarding such a sale, shall not be
deemed an Acquisition Proposal for any purpose hereunder. 

   

 (d) Neither the Company Board nor the Transaction Committee shall, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or the Transaction Committee of the Merger, this Agreement or the Voting Agreement; (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii), whether taken by the Company Board or any committee thereof, including the Transaction Committee, a " _Change in Board Recommendation_ "); or (iii) approve or recommend or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar agreement to consummate any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (e) If, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board (acting through, or based upon the advice of the Transaction Committee if such committee still exists), in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) concludes is a Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent written notice that shall state expressly (A) that it has received an Acquisition Proposal which constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal and the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ "). 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding Section 6.04(d), at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board or the Transaction Committee has concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board or the Transaction Committee to make a Change in Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under 

    ##### 

  

    

applicable Law, then the Company Board or the Transaction Committee may
(subject to the Company having complied with its obligations under this
Section 6.04) (i) make a Change in Board Recommendation or (ii)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , however that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless substantially concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant
to Section 8.03(b)(iii) and enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal. 

   

 (g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or the Transaction Committee, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or is otherwise required under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company Board nor the Transaction Committee may (i) make a Change in Board Recommendation or (ii) take any position under Rule 14e-2(a) other than recommending rejection of such tender or exchange offer, in each case, without first complying with this Section 6.04. 

   

 (h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not solicited or initiated in violation of this Section 6.04 that (1) relates to an acquisition by a Person or group acting in concert of either of (A) more than 50% of the outstanding Shares pursuant to a tender offer, merger or otherwise or (B) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) is on terms that the Company Board or the Transaction Committee determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) are more favorable to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) from a financial point of view than this Agreement and (3) which the Company Board or the Transaction Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and its outside legal counsel and after taking into account all legal, financial, antitrust, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal including, without limitation, the financing thereof and any conditions thereto) is reasonably capable of being consummated. 

   

 SECTION 6.05. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company (or the relevant Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and advance expenses to, each present and former director or officer of the Company and each Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), in and to the extent of their capacities as such and not as stockholders of the Company or any Subsidiary, in respect of actions, omissions or events 

    ##### 

  

    

through the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, if any Indemnified Party
becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding
or investigation covered by this Section 6.05 after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Party
his or her legal or other expenses (including the cost of any investigation
and preparation incurred in connection therewith). 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) cause to be obtained a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time or (ii) maintain the existing officers and directors liability insurance policies maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable to the Indemnified Parties) for a period of six years after the Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that if the existing officers and directors liability insurance policies expire, are terminated or cancelled during such six-year period or require an annual premium in excess of 200% of the current premium paid by the Company for such insurance, the Company will obtain as much coverage as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess of 200% (on an annualized basis) of such current premium. The Company shall be entitled (after reasonable consultation with Parent) to obtain and fully pay prior to the Effective Time a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of no more than six years from the Effective Time with respect to the directors and officers liability and insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies for claims arising from the facts and events that occurred prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the cost thereof does not exceed an amount equal to $1,250,000. In such case the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to provide the insurance specified in this Section 6.05(b). 

   

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the transferee or transferees of such properties and assets, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. 

   

 SECTION 6.06. _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide the employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries who are in employment as of the Effective Time (each, an " _Employee_ "), with base salary, employee benefits and incentive compensation opportunities (other than equity-based compensation and change in control benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Employees 

    ##### 

  

    

immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ , subject
to managements discretion, and the board of directors reasonable business
judgment based upon the results of operations of the Company that, it shall,
or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain
the following plans without any decrease in contributions or benefits for a
period of twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Time: the Sequa 401(k)
Plan, Sequa Retirement Plan, Sequa Pension Plan, Sequa Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan I (" _SERP I_ "), Sequa Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan II (" _SERP II_ ") and Sequa Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan III
(" _SERP III_ "). Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any Employee, or to restrict the right of the
Surviving Corporation to terminate any Employee, provided that no such
termination of any Employee shall result in the loss to any such Employee of
any accrued or vested rights or benefits under any Plan (subject to the terms
and conditions of such Plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any Plan or any other compensation or
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, or (ii) shall limit the right
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate
or otherwise modify any Plan or any other compensation or employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement following the Closing Date, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Plans. Parent, Merger
Co and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.06 with respect to Employees are included for the sole benefit
of Parent, Merger Co and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express
or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in
any other Person, including, without limitation, any Employees, former
Employees, any participant in any Employee Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates or continued
participation in any Employee Plan. 

   

 (b) Employees shall receive credit for their services with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. 

   

 (c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (" _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an active Employee may become eligible to participate in the one-year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) waive, or use reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each active Employee under any Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Employee and his or her covered dependents under comparable Plans during the plan year in which such individuals move to a comparable Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to be taken into account under the Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying all deductible, 

    ##### 

  

    

coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Employee and his or her dependents as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans. 

   

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly agreed that the provisions of Section 9.06 shall apply to this Section 6.06. 

   

 (e) Parent hereby agrees that, subject to managements discretion, and the board of directors reasonable business judgment based upon the results of operations of the Company, for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Effective Time, that it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue to maintain and fund the Sequa Corporation Grantor Trust Agreement by and between Sequa Corporation and Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A. (the " _SERP Trust_ ") consistent in all material respects with the manner funded by the Company during the two years prior to the Effective Date. 

   

 SECTION 6.07. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third Person and/or any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained herein, (ii) Parent will promptly notify the Company in writing of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent or Merger Co contained herein and (iii) the Company will notify Parent in writing and Parent will notify the Company in writing of any communication received (A) from any Person alleging a consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.08. _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters ( _provided_ that Parent may replace or amend the Commitment Letters so long as the terms would not (x) be adverse to the interests of the Company prior to the Effective Time in any material respect or (y) adversely affect or unreasonably delay the ability of Parent or Merger Co to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, conditions, representations and warranties applicable to Parent set forth in the Commitment Letters; (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters or on other terms acceptable to Parent; and (iii) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters. Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of all such definitive agreements (excluding any fee letters or engagement letters which, by their terms, are confidential) to the Company promptly upon their execution. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the 

    ##### 

  

    

Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (on terms and
conditions no less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions as set
forth in the Commitment Letters) in an amount sufficient to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall notify the
Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) business days, if at any
time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be
terminated for any reason or (ii) any financing source that is a party to the
Commitment Letter notifies Parent or Merger Sub that such source no longer
intends to either provide or underwrite financing to Merger Sub on the
material terms set forth therein. 

   

 (b) If the Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment (a " _New Financing Commitment_ ") that provides for at least the same amount of financing as the Commitment Letter as originally issued and on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent or Merger Co than those included in the Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such New Financing Commitment shall not without the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied) (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, (ii) expand the conditions to the Closing Date drawdown to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letter in any material respect or (iii) otherwise be adverse to the interests of the Company prior to the Effective Time in any material respect, including but not limited to terms that would, as compared to the Commitment Letter, adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In such event, the term "Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to mean the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect. 

   

 (c) The Company agrees to provide, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause, the Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, such cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (including, without limitation, the issuance of senior notes and/or senior subordinated notes contemplated by the Commitment Letters) as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries), including without limitation (i) participation in meetings, road shows, drafting sessions, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with the Companys financial statements as of, and for the nine month period ended September 30, 2007 and such other financial statements and financial data of the type and for the periods required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K and of type and form and for the periods customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act to consummate the offering of secured or unsecured senior notes and/or senior subordinated notes as of the date such offering will be made (collectively, the " _Required Financial Information_ ") and such other financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) offering documents for any portion of the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any of the Debt Financing, (v) providing and executing 

    ##### 

  

    

documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate
of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency
matters, (vi) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and
otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral, and (vii) using reasonable
efforts to obtain consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing, accountants comfort letters, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. The Company hereby consents
to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended or not reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

Thereafter, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger, except to the extent public disclosure is required by applicable Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, in which case the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement. 

  

 SECTION 6.11. _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the

Such notice shall specify that such redemption is a Conditional Redemption (as defined in Section 3.04 of the Trust Indenture) and is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and shall otherwise be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent. The Company shall take such other actions as are reasonably requested by Parent to effect such redemption promptly following the Effective Time; provided, that the Company shall not be required to waive the condition that the Merger be consummated prior to the consummation of the Merger.

 (d) _Governmental Consents_. Any other approval of any Governmental Authority or waiting periods under any applicable Laws or regulation of any Governmental Authority shall have been obtained or have expired (without the imposition of any material condition) if the failure to obtain any such approval or the failure of any such waiting period to expire would constitute a material violation of Law or subject any party to any material fine or other material adverse consequences.

 (c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. 

   

 SECTION 9.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as 

   ##### 

  

    

possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 9.05. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Guarantees, the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise), except that Parent or Merger Co may assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate, to a lender or financial institution as collateral for indebtedness or, after the Closing, in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations. 

  

 SECTION 9.06. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.05 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons). 

  

 SECTION 9.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to the choice of Laws principles therein). 

  

 SECTION 9.08. _Specific Performance; Submission to Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Co for such losses or damages shall be limited to $60,570,000, (ii) the maximum liability of the Guarantors, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the express obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees, and (iii) in no event shall the Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from Parent, Merger Co or the Guarantors or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents in connection therewith. 

   

 (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Co shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in Court of Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of this Section 9.08. The parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Co or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with 

    ##### 

  

    

respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in Section 8.01(e)
and Section 9.08(a); _provided_  that the Company shall be entitled to
specific performance against Parent and Merger Co to prevent any breach by
Parent or Merger Co of Section 6.03(b). In addition, each of the parties
hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the Court of Chancery or other courts of the State
of Delaware and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.02.
Each party hereto hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.02 shall be effective
service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 SECTION 9.09. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Merger, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.9. 

  

 SECTION 9.10. _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, which delivery will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Co and the Company have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
