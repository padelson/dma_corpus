if not yet due, accrued, (b)&nbsp;as of the date of this Agreement, there is no claim pending under the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' insurance policies or fidelity bonds as to which

Company as treasury stock, shares held by Parent or by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent and any Dissenting Shares) of Company Common Stock under this Agreement is fair from a financial
point of view to such holders. A written copy of such opinion will be delivered promptly after the date hereof to Parent for informational purposes only. </FONT></P>

(including any replacement thereof in connection with any Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing), as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with
Section&nbsp;7.06, and including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such agreements, are hereinafter referred to together as the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Debt Financing

of Parent, the other parties thereto, and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity). None of the Debt Financing
Agreements will be amended or modified except in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.06. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to (i)&nbsp;constitute a material breach or default by Parent under any Debt Financing Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;to the knowledge of Parent, result in the failure of any
condition contained in any Debt Financing Agreement to be satisfied or (iii)&nbsp;to the knowledge of Parent, result in the commitments provided in any Debt Financing Agreement being unavailable on
the Closing Date. The consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements, and to the knowledge of the Parent
there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce
the total amount of the Debt Financing, other than in each case those conditions or contingencies expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements. Except for fee letters relating to fees with
respect to the Debt Financing (redacted copies of which, removing fee amounts, market "flex" provisions and certain other terms (none of which would adversely affect the amounts or availability of the
Debt Financing), have been provided to the Company) and a mandate letter setting out the mandates and roles awarded to the financing banks and certain syndication related provisions, there are no side
letters or other Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party directly related to the quantum or conditionality of the Debt Financing, other than the Debt Financing Agreements. As of the date of
this Agreement, assuming no breach by the Company of its representations or warranties hereunder, and the Company's compliance with its covenants and agreements hereunder (including
Section&nbsp;6.05), Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on
or prior to the Closing Date. Parent has, or at the Closing will have, whether through proceeds from the Debt Financing, cash or cash equivalents held by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, or
otherwise, sufficient cash to enable Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay or cause to be paid all amounts required to be paid by them or required to be caused by them to be paid in cash in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the aggregate Merger Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses payable by them arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. </FONT></P>

limiting Section&nbsp;11.13, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing

shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts referred to in
Section&nbsp;11.08 without proof of actual damages (and each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy); in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. </FONT></P>
