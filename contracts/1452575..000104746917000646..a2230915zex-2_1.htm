Article 2 
THE MERGER

  

    Section 2.01. _ The Merger. _ (a) At the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company
in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

  

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (i) in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than three Business 

  

      

  

Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
waiver of such conditions by the party or parties entitled to the benefit
thereof at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or (ii) at such other place, at such other time or on such
other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the date on which
the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

   

 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in the certificate of merger). 

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.02. _ Conversion of Shares. _ At the Effective Time: 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c), Section 2.04 or Section 2.05, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest. For the sake of clarity, any dividends that are declared by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the terms hereof having a record date prior to the Effective Time which remain unpaid as of the Effective Time shall be satisfied by the Company on the payment date prescribed by the Board of Directors of the Company for such dividend even if such date occurs after the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other Persons) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent or by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that Parent or each such Subsidiary, as applicable, owns the same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as Parent or such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, except as provided in Section 2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.03. _ Surrender and Payment. _ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) subject to Section 2.05, uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make available, or shall cause to be made available, to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated 

        

Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent for all purposes after the Effective Time only the right to receive such Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article 2\. 

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2\. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to, or as directed by, Parent (or a Subsidiary of Parent that appointed the Exchange Agent, if any), upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable, for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor such Subsidiary, if any, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) Subject to Section 2.04, any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to, or as directed by, Parent (or a Subsidiary of Parent that appointed the Exchange Agent, if any), upon demand. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (g) Subject to Section 2.03(c)(ii), the payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.04. _ Dissenting Shares_.  Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

  

    
 Section 2.05. _ Employee Equity_.  (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt resolutions to effect the following: 

  

   

 (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Stock Option has not been exercised and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Stock Option; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, each Stock Option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time for no consideration; 

  

 (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding RSUs, other than RSUs granted after the date of this Agreement (the "2017 RSUs"), as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration; 

   

 (iii) adjust the terms of all outstanding PSUs, other than PSUs granted after the date of this Agreement (the "2017 PSUs"), as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the PSU Amount and (B) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "PSU Amount" means, with respect to any PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the sum of (1) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be delivered to the holder of such award based on the actual achievement of the performance goals applicable to such award for any completed one-year performance period ending prior to the Effective Time, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) prior to the 

   

      

   

Effective Time, and assuming the satisfaction of all other conditions to such
delivery, and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
award that would be delivered to the holder of such award based on target
achievement of the performance goals applicable to such award for any one-year
performance period that has not been completed as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and assuming the satisfaction of all other conditions to
such delivery; and

  

 (iv) provide terms for all of the 2017 RSUs and 2017 PSUs that are consistent with the provisions set forth in Section 6.01(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

    

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.05 as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event no later than five days) after the Effective Time. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.06. _ Adjustments_.  Without limiting or affecting any of the provisions of Section 6.01, if, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 2.07. _ Withholding Rights_.  Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and any of their respective Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration or any payment otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Applicable Law, including federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or any such Affiliate, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or such Affiliate, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

    
 Section 2.08. _ Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2\.

Except for breaches, violations or defaults which have not had and would not reasonably be 

  

      

  

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (A) each of the Material Contracts is in full force and
effect, and is a valid and binding Contract of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, of each other
party thereto, enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, each other party thereto, in
accordance with its terms (except for any Material Contracts that expired in
accordance with their respective terms or were otherwise amended, modified
or terminated after the date of this Agreement in accordance with Section
6.01) and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
Company\'s knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, any other party to a
Material Contract, has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take
any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default under the provisions of, such Material Contract, and

has breached, violated or defaulted under any Material Contract.

 Section 4.22. _ Finders\' Fees_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 4.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and accurate description of all fees and other economic, payment or expense reimbursement provisions and any other provisions relevant or related to the calculation or determination thereof (in each case, other than customary indemnification provisions) in any engagement letter between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each of Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Morgan Stanley and Co.

A written copy of such opinion will be delivered promptly after the date hereof to Parent for informational purposes only. 

  

    
 Section 4.24. _ Antitakeover Statutes_.  The Company has no "rights plan," "rights agreement," or "poison pill" in effect.

No other "control share acquisition," "fair price," 

        

"moratorium," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws enacted under
U.S. state or federal laws apply to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 Section 5.07. _ Financing; Sufficiency of Funds. _ (a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of a fully executed, definitive credit facilities agreement entered into with the financial institution(s) named therein, pursuant to which such financial institution(s) (together with the financial institution(s) providing any Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing, the "Financing Sources") have committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt financing described therein in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such credit facilities agreement, together with any similar financing agreement executed in accordance with Section 7.06 (including any replacement thereof in connection with any Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing), as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with Section 7.06, and including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such agreements, are hereinafter referred to together as the "Debt Financing Agreements." The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Financing Agreements is hereinafter referred to as the "Debt Financing". 

  

  

 (b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Agreements are in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and general principles of equity). None of the Debt Financing Agreements will be amended or modified except in accordance with Section 7.06. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a material breach or default by Parent under any Debt Financing Agreement, (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, result in the failure of any condition contained in any Debt Financing Agreement to be satisfied or (iii) to the knowledge of Parent, result in the commitments provided in any Debt Financing Agreement being unavailable on the Closing Date. The consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements, and to the knowledge of the Parent there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing, other than in each case those conditions or contingencies expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements. Except for fee letters relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (redacted copies of which, removing fee amounts, market "flex" provisions and certain other terms (none of which would adversely affect the amounts or availability of the Debt Financing), have been provided to the Company) and a mandate letter setting out the mandates and roles awarded to the financing banks and certain syndication related provisions, there are no side letters or other Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party directly related to the quantum or conditionality of the Debt Financing, other than the Debt Financing Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming no breach by the Company of its representations or warranties hereunder, and the Company\'s compliance with its covenants and agreements hereunder (including Section 6.05), Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent has, or at the Closing will have, whether through proceeds from the Debt Financing, cash or cash equivalents held by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, or otherwise, sufficient cash to enable Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay or cause to be paid all amounts required to be paid by them or required to be caused by them to be paid in cash in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the aggregate Merger Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses payable by them arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Without limiting Section 11.13, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to Closing or to any of the other obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder. 

  

       

    
 Section 5.08. _ Finders\' Fees. _ Except for HSBC Bank plc, Merrill Lynch International, Robey Warshaw LLP and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 5.09. _ Interested Stockholder. _ Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" has been an "interested stockholder" of the Company at any time within three years of the date of this Agreement, as those terms are used in Section 203 of Delaware Law. 

  

    
 Section 5.10. _ Litigation. _ There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person for whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable or any of their respective properties before (or, in the case of threatened actions, suits, investigations or proceedings, would be before) or by any Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

    
 Section 5.11. _ Agreements and Understandings. _ Parent has disclosed to the Company all written contracts or arrangements as of the date of this Agreement, (and Parent has furnished to the Company correct and complete copies thereof) between or among Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and (a) any member of the Board of Directors of the Company or management of the Company or (b) any Person that owns 5% or more of the shares of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (based on information filed with the SEC), on the other hand, in each case that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

    
 Section 5.12. _ No Other Representations; No Reliance; Waiver. _ Parent and Merger Sub have conducted their own independent review and analysis of the Company and, based thereon, have formed an independent judgment concerning the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants, acknowledges and agrees that other than as expressly set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement, none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or stockholders or any of their respective Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub, any of their Affiliates or stockholders or any of their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Parent Related Persons") in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations, future cash flows or future financial condition, or any component of the foregoing, or any other forward looking information, of the Company or any of its Affiliates, and no Parent Related Person has relied on any information or statements made or provided (or not made or provided) to any Parent Related Person other than the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 6.03(a), but subject (as applicable) to compliance with the following provisions of this Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders (but in no event after the adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders): 

    

 (i) if the Company or any of its Representatives receive a written Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.03, (A) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may contact such Third Party for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel to the Company, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (x) furnish information (including non-public information) relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Third Party that has made such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with such Third Party with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement with such Third Party (1) need not include a standstill provision or prohibit the submission of Acquisition Proposals or amendments thereto to the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company, and (2) shall not in any event include provisions requiring exclusive negotiations (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), a copy of which confidentiality agreement with such Third Party shall be provided to Parent promptly after the execution thereof; _provided_ that, to the extent that any such information furnished to such Third Party or its Representatives has not been previously provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives, all such information shall be promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) provided or made available to Parent and (y) enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal;

 (iii) other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change, 

    

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), only
if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure to take
such action would (or, in the case of clause (i), could) reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company
from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so
comply is consistent with this Section 6.03; _provided_ that unless the Board
of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
such statement or in connection with such action by the close of business on
the 10th Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal
under Rule 14e-2(a), such action shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) issuing "stop, look and listen"

 (e) _ _ _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.03 for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or more than 50% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, and taking into 

  

      

  

account all circumstances reasonably deemed relevant by the Board of
Directors of the Company (including the expected timing and likelihood of
consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements, any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation,
availability of necessary financing and other financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal), would result in a transaction
that if consummated, is more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a
financial point of view than as provided hereunder (taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.03(d)).

  

 (f) _ _ _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, shall cause each Company Transaction Representative to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Other Company Representative to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall request that any such Third Party and its Representatives in possession of confidential information about the Company or its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to such Persons return or destroy all such information and deliver a certification as to such return or destruction, which certifications the Company shall seek to obtain as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All information furnished pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that in no event shall the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement be deemed to prevent the disclosure of any information by Parent (A) to Parent Sponsor or the UKLA, or (B) in the Parent Shareholder Circular to the extent required in order for Parent to comply with the Listing Rules or any other requirements of the UKLA. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

 Section 6.06. _ Stockholder Litigation. _ The Company shall notify Parent in writing as promptly as practicable after it has received written notice of any stockholder litigation (including derivative claims) against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Merger-Related Litigation") before any Governmental Authority.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with Parent\'s directors\' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to Parent\'s shareholders at the Parent Shareholder Meeting notwithstanding any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

    
 Section 7.04. _ Director and Officer Liability_.  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with each Indemnified Person in the defense of any action. 

   

 (b) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) which provide for exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for each Indemnified Person with respect to any matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to, and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase a prepaid directors\' and officers\' liability "tail" insurance policy or other comparable directors\' and officers\' liability and fiduciary liability policies, in each case providing coverage for claims asserted prior to and for six years after the Effective Time with respect to any matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and, with respect to claims made prior to or during such period, until final resolution thereof), with levels of coverage, terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof (the "DandO Insurance"); _provided_ that if the aggregate annual cost for such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which amount is set forth in Section 7.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Surviving Corporation shall instead be obligated to obtain DandO Insurance with the best available coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate annual cost of 300% of the current annual premium.

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.05. _ Employee Matters_.  (a) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2018 (or such shorter period of employment, as the case may be) (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each employee who is actively employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, including any employee who is out on leave or disability (to the extent that such items are applicable to such inactive employees) (each, a "Covered Employee"), (i) base salary, base wage rate and annual cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable, in each case, than the base salary, base wage rate and annual cash incentive opportunities that were provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other benefits in the aggregate that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than equity compensation and other long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements to the extent such benefits are paid to a Covered Employee) that were provided to such Covered Employee under the Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  

 (b) During the Continuation Period, in the event that a Covered Employee\'s employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries is terminated or such Person takes any other action that would have entitled such Covered Employee to receive severance payments and benefits under the Company\'s severance plans or practices as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and as set forth on Section 7.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Severance Practice"), the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall provide such Covered Employee with severance payments and benefits no less favorable than the severance payments and benefits determined pursuant to the Company 

  

      

  

Severance Practice determined using such Covered Employee\'s then current
compensation and years of service (determined in accordance with this
Agreement).

 (d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, with the Company and its Subsidiaries for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for purposes of vacation, severance and matching contributions to defined contribution retirement plans (other than as set forth herein), as applicable) to the same extent recognized under the corresponding Employee Plans; _provided, however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any: (i) defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent or (ii) Parent retiree medical program or other retiree welfare benefit program in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this Section 7.04 result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service. 

   

 (e) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" of the Company for purposes of any Employee Plan that contains a definition of "change in control" or "change of control", as applicable. 

  

 (f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section 7.04, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Affiliates) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any obligation on the part of Parent or its Affiliates (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Affiliates) to employ any Covered Employee for any period following the Closing Date. 

  

  

    
 Section 7.06. _ Financing_.  (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Agreements, including using its reasonable best efforts to satisfy (or if determined advisable by Parent, obtain the 

        

waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
contained in the Debt Financing Agreements to the extent such conditions are
within Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s control. Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice of (x) any material breach by any party to the Debt Financing
Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware which would cause the
Debt Financing to become unavailable, (y) any termination of any of the Debt
Financing Agreements or (z) the receipt of any notice from any Financing
Source with respect to such Financing Source\'s failure or anticipated
failure to fund its commitments under any Debt Financing Agreements. If any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable (it being understood that
Parent and/or Merger Sub shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of
consummated equity offerings or debt offerings or incurrences of debt for all
or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Agreements by reducing commitments under the Debt Financing Agreements), each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such unavailability,
alternative debt financing for such portion thereof (to the extent such
portion will not instead be funded by Parent and/or Merger Sub (at their sole
discretion) from cash or cash equivalents) from alternative debt financing
sources ("Alternative Financing") in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and, if known and not subject to any obligation
of confidentiality, the reason therefor. If obtained, Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (other than any fee
letters, mandate letters and engagement letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative financing source shall have committed to provide Parent or Merger
Sub with Alternative Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the
Company\'s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, any Debt Financing Agreement unless the terms
and conditions of such Debt Financing Agreement (taken as a whole), as so
amended, modified or waived, are no more onerous on Parent (in the reasonable
judgment of Parent) as those contained in such Debt Financing Agreement prior
to giving effect to such amendment, modification or waiver; _provided_ that in
the case of amendments or modifications of any Debt Financing Agreement, the
foregoing shall only apply if such amendment or modification (A) would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
adversely affects the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to such Debt Financing Agreement. Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of
its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing.

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, in its sole discretion and at any time, may replace any Debt Financing Agreement with another commitment letter, definitive credit facility or other financing agreement (a "Replacement Debt Financing Agreement") pursuant to which any financial institution(s) selected by Parent in its sole discretion commit to provide debt financing to finance the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Replacement Debt Financing") and at any time after the effectiveness thereof Parent may, in its sole discretion, terminate the applicable Debt Financing Agreement and the commitments thereunder; _provided_ that, without the Company\'s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the terms and conditions of any Replacement Debt Financing (taken as a whole) shall be no more onerous on Parent (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as those contained in the Debt Financing Agreement(s) being replaced. Promptly after the termination of any Debt Financing Agreement and the execution of any Replacement Debt Financing Agreement by Parent in accordance with this Section 7.05(b), Parent shall notify the Company of such events and provide fully executed copies of such Replacement Debt Financing Agreement and any agreements relating thereto (other than any fee letters or engagement letters). 

  

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to Closing or to any of the other obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder. 

  

       

    
 Section 7.07. _ Parent Litigation_.  Parent shall notify the Company in writing as promptly as practicable after it has received written notice of any litigation against Parent, Merger Sub, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement before any Governmental Authority, and shall thereafter keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such litigation.

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable, by way of compensation, an amount equal to all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including obtaining the Debt Financing or any Bond Refinancing) subject to cap on such reimbursement of $20,000,000 ("Parent Cost Reimbursement"), within one Business Day after the date of the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by Parent) or concurrently with, and as a condition precedent to, the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by the Company), and in addition, if (A) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn and (B) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal or entered into a definitive agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (ii), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable, by way of compensation, an amount equal to the Termination Fee, less any amounts already paid to Parent with respect to the Parent Cost Reimbursement, within one Business Day after the first date on which the Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such transaction. 

   

      

   

 (iii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) and (A) prior to the date of such termination a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn, and (B) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal or entered into a definitive agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (iii), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, by way of compensation, the Termination Fee within one Business Day after the first date on which the Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such transaction; _provided_ that no Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company under this Section 10.03(a)(iii) if at the date of such termination, the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c) has not been satisfied, or the condition set forth in Section 9.01(d) has not been satisfied solely in connection with any Restraint in respect of any Competition Law. 

    

 (b) _ _ _Parent Termination Fees_. 

    

 (i) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii), then Parent shall pay to the Company, by way of compensation, $480,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee"), within one Business Day after the date of the termination of the Agreement. 

  

 (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iv), then Parent shall pay to the Company, by way of compensation, the Reverse Termination Fee, within one Business Day after the date of the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by the Company) or concurrently with, and as a condition precedent to, the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by Parent). 

    

 (c) _ _ _VAT_. The parties anticipate that the Termination Fee, the Parent Cost Reimbursement and the Reverse Termination Fee, if paid, being compensatory in nature, shall not be treated, in whole or in part, as consideration for a supply for VAT purposes. However, if under a reverse charge mechanism, the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, is or is deemed to be consideration, in whole or in part, for a supply for VAT purposes, then the amount of the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by an amount such that the sum payable by Parent or the Company, as applicable, when aggregated with any irrecoverable VAT in respect thereof, shall be equal to the amount of the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, that would be payable but for this Section 10.03(c). Such adjusting payment or payments as may be required between the parties to give effect to this Section 10.03(c) shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable. 

  

 (d) _ _ _Payment_. Any payment of the Termination Fee, the Reverse Termination Fee or the Parent Cost Reimbursement shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, or the Company, as applicable. 

  

 (e) _ _ _Costs and Expenses_. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, such party would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the applicable party fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 10.03, such party shall also pay any costs, fees and expenses incurred by the other party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due 

  

      

  

until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ , in effect on the date of such payment.

   

 (f) _ _ _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The parties agree and understand that (i) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) in no event shall Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable, be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.03(a), to receive an amount greater than the Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.03(b), to receive an amount greater than the Reverse Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud of any party hereto, (x) if Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable receives the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or if the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 10.03(b), such payment, together with any costs, fees or expenses payable pursuant to Section 10.03(e), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives and none of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) if (A) Parent or Merger Sub receive any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03, or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03, the amount of such Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, in respect of any such breaches.

 Section 11.07. _ Governing Law_.  This Agreement and all actions (whether in contract or tort) based on, arising out of or relating to the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Applicable Law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. 

  

    
 Section 11.08. _ Jurisdiction_.  The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting 

        

the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as

relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising under or relating

 Section 11.09. _ WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). 

  

    
 Section 11.11. _ Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof. 

   

    
 Section 11.12. _ Severability_.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

    
 Section 11.13. _ Specific Performance_.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts referred to in Section 11.08 without proof of actual damages (and each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy); in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.
