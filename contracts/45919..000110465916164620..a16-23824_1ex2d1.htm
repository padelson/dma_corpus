position on a disputed item (or a position in between the positions of the
Sellers Representative and US Buyer) based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to any
independent review. In resolving such objections, the Accounting Firm shall
apply the provisions of this Agreement concerning determination of the amounts
set forth in the Closing Statement. The Accounting Firm shall deliver to the
Sellers Representative and US Buyer a written determination (such
determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by the Sellers Representative and US Buyer)
of the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm within 30 days of
receipt of such disputed items. The determination by the Accounting Firm of
the disputed amounts and the Purchase Price shall be conclusive and binding on
the Parties, absent manifest error or fraud or willful misconduct as
determined by a non-appealable and binding decision by a court of law having
jurisdiction over the parties. The losing party (as defined below) in any such
proceeding shall pay all costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses of the prevailing party) related to such determination by the
Accounting Firm, including the costs relating to any negotiations with the
Accounting Firm with respect to the terms and conditions of such Accounting
Firms engagement and the costs for the Accounting Firms services. For
purposes of this _Section 2.4(c)_, as between the Sellers Representative and
US Buyer, the "losing party" in any such determination shall mean the party
whose calculation of the Purchase Price (as set forth in the Closing Date
Statement, in the case of US Buyer, or in the Objection Notice, in the case of
the Sellers Representative), is farthest from the calculation of the Purchase
Price as determined by the Accounting Firm. The Parties agree that (except as
otherwise provided in _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _9.2(a)(iv)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(v)_) the procedure set forth in this
_Section 2.4_ for resolving disputes with respect to Closing Net Working
Capital, Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and
the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price under _Section 2.2(a)_ shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy for resolving such disputes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parties agree that judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
Party against which such determination is to be enforced.

 



 

(d) _Payment of Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_ (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "), exceeds the Estimated
Purchase Price, then US Buyer shall, within five Business Days following the
determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 2.4_, pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers Representative (on
behalf of Sellers on a Pro Rata Share basis) an amount equal to such excess by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Sellers Representative at least two Business Days prior to
such payment date.

 



 

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, then
the Sellers Representative and US Buyer shall, within five Business Days
following the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_, deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Adjustment
Escrow Funds an amount equal to such excess to US Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by US Buyer
in such joint written instructions. In the event the Adjustment Escrow Funds
are insufficient to cover the amount of such excess, then the Sellers
Representative shall, within five Business Days following the determination of
the Final Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.4_,
pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Sellers to US Buyer an amount equal
to such shortfall not covered by the Adjustment Escrow Funds, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by US Buyer
at least two Business Days prior to such payment date.

 



 

(iii) Once payment is made in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)(i)_ or _(ii)_ ,
the Sellers Representative and US Buyer shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
the Sellers Representative all remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds, if any, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers
Representative in such joint written instructions.

 



 

2.5 _Required Withholdings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, each Buyer will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person such amounts as are required under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by any
Buyer, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made by such Buyer. Prior to making any
deduction or withholding from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, each Buyer shall use commercially

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable efforts to provide five days prior written notice to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding were made of the amounts
subject to deduction or withholding and provide such Person a reasonable
opportunity within such five days to provide forms or other evidence that
would exempt or reduce such amounts from such deduction or withholding under
applicable Tax Law. Each Buyer agrees to accept properly completed and duly
executed documentation that will permit any consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to be made without or at a reduced rate of
withholding under applicable Tax Law.

thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which such Buyer is a party and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate, company, or limited liability company, as applicable,
action on the part of such Buyer. This Agreement has been, and each other
Transaction Document to which such Buyer is a party will be at or prior to the
Closing, duly executed and delivered by such Buyer and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties hereto or thereto,
this Agreement constitutes, and each other Transaction Document to which such
Buyer is a party will constitute when executed and delivered, a valid and
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against such Buyer in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and (b) the availability of injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies.

 



      
 

 



 

6.3 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

of such Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except for any filings that may be required to comply with the HSR Act and
any foreign antitrust and competition Law, no Authorization or Order of,
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to any Governmental Entity
is required by any Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except
for such Authorizations, Orders, registrations, declarations, filings and
notices the failure to obtain which would not reasonably be expected to (i) be

Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.4 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no Proceeding that is pending or, to any
Buyers knowledge, threatened (i) against or involving, directly or

perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

6.5 _Financial Capability_. As of the date of this Agreement, US Buyer has
delivered to the Seller Parties a true, correct and complete copy of an
executed commitment letter (the " _Commitment Letter_ ") with the Financing
Sources party thereto to provide US Buyer debt financing in the aggregate
amount of up to $395,000,000 (the " _Financing_ "). The Commitment Letter is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of US Buyer and, to the knowledge of US
Buyer, the other parties to the Commitment Letter, except as may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors rights generally and
general equitable principles, and is in full force and effect. Prior to the
date of this Agreement, the commitment contained in the Commitment Letter has
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect (and no party thereto has
indicated an intent to so withdraw or rescind) or otherwise amended or
modified in any respect. US Buyer is not in breach of any of the terms or
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and, to the knowledge of US
Buyer, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by US Buyer or
failure by US Buyer to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letter. US Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees on the dates and to the extent required by the Commitment Letter
and shall in the future pay any fees due from it and arising under the
Commitment Letter and any related fee letter(s) as they become due. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies relating to the funding of the
full amount of the proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter except as
stated in the Commitment Letter and US Buyer has no reason to believe that any
of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied on the Closing Date
or that the Financing will not be available to US Buyer on the Closing Date

 



      
 

 



 

in an amount sufficient (when taken together with Buyers other available
sources of funds described below) to enable Buyers to pay the Estimated
Purchase Price and the fees and expenses of Buyers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required to be paid at
the Closing. The net proceeds of the Financing, together with available cash
on hand of Buyers, available lines of credit with no contingencies or
conditions to draw under such lines of credit except as disclosed as of the
date hereof or other sources of immediately available funds, with no
contingencies or conditions to draw such funds except as disclosed as of the
date hereof, shall be sufficient to enable Buyers to pay the Estimated
Purchase Price and the fees and expenses of Buyers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required to be paid at
the Closing. Each Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not subject to
any financing contingency or condition.

 



 

6.6 _Brokers_. Neither any Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any Liability
or obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which any
Seller or its Affiliates could become liable or obligated.

 



 

6.7 _Investment Intent_. Each Buyer is acquiring the applicable Purchased
Shares for its own account for investment and not with a view to, or for sale
or other disposition in connection with, any distribution of all or any part
thereof in violation of federal or state securities Law. In acquiring the
applicable Purchased Shares, each Buyer is not offering or selling, and will
not offer or sell, for Sellers in connection with any distribution of such
Purchased Shares, and each Buyer will not participate in any such undertaking
or in any underwriting of such an undertaking except in compliance with
applicable federal and state securities Laws. Each Buyer acknowledges that it
is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment in
the applicable Purchased Shares, and has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in such Purchased Shares. Each Buyer is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D under the U.S. Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). Each Buyer understands that the
applicable Purchased Shares have not been registered pursuant to the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities Laws, that such Purchased
Shares will be characterized as "restricted securities" under federal
securities Laws and that under such Laws and applicable regulations such
Purchased Shares cannot be sold or otherwise disposed of without registration
under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom.

 



 

6.8 _Investigation_. Each Buyer is a sophisticated entity, is knowledgeable
about the industry in which the Target Companies operate, experienced in
investments in such businesses and able to bear the economic risk associated
with the purchase of the applicable Purchased Shares. Each Buyer has such
knowledge and experience as to be aware of the risks and uncertainties
inherent in the purchase of equity interests and related contractual rights
and obligations of the type contemplated in this Agreement, as well as the
knowledge of the Target Companies and their operations in particular, and has
independently, based on such information made its own analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Each Buyer had access to the books, records,
facilities and personnel of the Target Companies for purposes of conducting
its due diligence investigation of the Target Companies.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9 _Disclaimer Regarding Projections_. Buyers may be in possession of certain
plans, projections and other forecasts regarding the Target Companies
delivered or made available to Buyers by or on behalf of Sellers. Each Buyer
acknowledges that there are substantial uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such plans, projections and other forecasts, and accordingly is not
relying on them, that such Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that
such Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all plans, projections and other forecasts so
furnished to it, and that such Buyer shall have no claim against anyone with
respect thereto, other than for fraud. Accordingly, each Buyer acknowledges
that, without limiting the generality of this _Section 6.9_, neither any
Seller nor any of its Representatives has made any representation or warranty
with respect to such plans, projections and other forecasts, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

6.10 _Solvency_. Assuming: (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Buyers
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) that the representations and warranties of the Seller Parties set forth
in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ are true and correct in all material
respects as of the Closing, (iii) that the most recent financial forecasts
relating to the Target Companies made available to Buyers prior to the date of
this Agreement have been prepared in good faith and on assumptions that were
reasonable at the time such forecasts were prepared and continue to be
reasonable, and (iv) that each Seller and each of the Target Companies, will
be solvent (x) immediately prior to giving effect to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and (y) immediately after giving effect to the Pre-Closing
Restructuring but immediately prior to the Closing, then immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Pre-Closing Restructuring), each Buyer and each of the Target Companies
shall be solvent and shall: (a) be able to pay their respective debts as they
become due in the ordinary course of business; (b) own property that has a
fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent Liabilities);
and (c) have adequate capital to carry on their collective business. No
transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any
Buyer or the Target Companies. In connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyers have not incurred, nor plan to incur,
debts beyond their ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

 



 

6.11 _Legal Impediments_. (a) There are no facts relating to any Buyer, any
applicable Law or any agreement to which any Buyer is a party that would
disqualify such Buyer from obtaining control of the applicable Target Company
or that would prevent, delay or limit in any material respect, the ability of
such Buyer to effect the Closing, and (b) no facts or circumstance exists,
including any possible other transaction under consideration by any Buyer (or
its Subsidiaries), that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay, in
any material respect, the filings or approvals required under the HSR Act or
any foreign antitrust and competition Law.

 



 

6.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 



 

(a) It is the explicit intent of each Party hereto that no Buyer is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, except those
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this _Article VI_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, (i) except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ or _Article V_,
neither any Seller, the Company, any of the other Target Companies nor any
other Person has made or is making any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to any of Sellers, the Company, the other Target
Companies, the Purchased Shares or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and the accuracy or completeness
of the information, records, and data now, heretofore, or hereafter made
available to Buyers in connection with this Agreement (including any
description of the Target Companies, the Assets, revenue, price and expense
assumptions, financial projections or forecasts, or any other information
furnished to Buyers by Sellers or any Representative of Sellers (including the
Target Companies) or any representative thereof) are hereby expressly
disclaimed and (ii) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, each Buyer has relied solely
upon its own investigation and the express representations and warranties of
the Seller Parties in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ and no other
representations and warranties of any Seller, the Company, the other Target
Companies or any other Person or any other information provided by, for or on
behalf of, any Seller, the Company, the other Target Companies or any other
Person to Buyers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

of the Disclosure Schedule (such support obligations are hereinafter referred
to as the " _Support Obligations_ ")).

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable, Buyers shall use reasonable best efforts to
replace the Support Obligations, and Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on
the other hand, shall cooperate, and each shall use its reasonable best
efforts, to effect the full and unconditional release, effective as of the
Closing Date, of Sellers or the applicable Non-Company Affiliate from all
Support Obligations and all obligations and Liabilities in respect thereof, by
(among other things):

 



 

(i) furnishing a letter of credit (or cash collateral) to replace or backstop

(ii) replacing any bonding/surety program on substantially similar terms and
conditions to the existing bonding agreement; or

 



 

(iii) replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on substantially
similar terms and conditions to the existing security agreement or arrangement

(c) Buyers, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall cooperate,
and each shall use their reasonable best efforts, to cause the beneficiary or
beneficiaries of such Support Obligations to (i) remit any cash and cash
equivalents (including any interest

 



      
 

 



 

payable thereon) to US Seller or one of its Non-Company Affiliates, as
applicable, held under any escrow or cash collateral arrangement that is a
Support Obligation promptly following the replacement of such escrow or cash
collateral arrangement pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ and (iii) terminate,
surrender and redeliver to US Seller, one of its Non-Company Affiliates or US
Sellers other designee each original copy of each guaranty, letter of credit,
bond, surety or other instrument constituting or evidencing such Support

(d) In the event that any of the Support Obligations are not replaced on or

Affiliates can terminate any Support Obligation, US Seller may, or may cause
the applicable Non-Company Affiliates to, terminate any such Support
Obligation in its sole discretion, (ii) US Buyer shall not be permitted to
amend or modify any of the terms of such Support Obligations without the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative or otherwise elect any options
to extend the underlying obligation pursuant to which the Support Obligation
has been provided without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, and (iii) pending the release or replacement of the Support
Obligations, US Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless US Seller and any of
its Non-Company Affiliates against all amounts paid or incurred by any of them

delayed), and any such permitted contacts shall be conducted in a manner which
will not materially adversely interfere with the operations or business
relationships of the Target Companies with such Persons; _provided_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not prohibit any Buyer from
contacting its customers, vendors or suppliers that are also customers,
vendors or suppliers of a Target Company, in the ordinary course of business

contemplated hereby are not discussed, and discussion of such topics are not
the purpose of such contact.

representation or warranty in relation to (including about the accuracy,
completeness, or truth of) any estimates, projections, forecasts, plans,
budgets or other forward-looking statements by the Seller Parties or their
respective Representatives to Buyers in connection with Buyers investigations

whether in relation to financial matters or anything else.

 



       
 

 



 

7.6 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall

to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

7.7 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties agree that
the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to automatically terminate in
its entirety, effective as of the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior
to the Closing Date and after any termination of this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 



 

(b) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, each Seller shall, and shall cause the Non-
Company Affiliates to, and shall instruct its and their respective officers,
directors and employees to, hold in confidence any and all confidential,
proprietary and non-public information and materials, whether in written,
verbal, graphic or other form, concerning any Buyer, its Affiliates, or any
Target Company (collectively, " _Company Confidential Information_ "), except
that no Seller shall have any obligation under this _Section 7.7(b)_ with
respect to any Company Confidential Information that: (i) as of the date of
this Agreement is, or after the date of this Agreement becomes, generally

after the Closing without use of or reference to the Company Confidential
Information. Each Seller shall, and shall cause the Non-Company Affiliates to,

Information that such party uses to protect its own trade secrets and
confidential information of a similar nature, which shall be no less than a
reasonable degree of care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall be
in breach of this _Section 7.7(b)_ as a result of any disclosure of Company
Confidential Information that is required by applicable Law or that is
required by any Governmental Entity or under any subpoena, civil investigative
demand or other similar process by a court of competent jurisdiction having
jurisdiction over such Seller, _provided_ that such Seller shall give advance
written notice of such compelled disclosure to US Buyer, and shall reasonably
cooperate with US Buyer in connection with any efforts to prevent or limit the
scope of such disclosure; and _provided further_ , that such Seller shall
disclose only that portion of such Company Confidential Information which such
Seller is advised by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed.

and each Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Companys, Trillium UKs
and Trillium Germanys efforts to obtain such Applicable Consents. Each Buyer
agrees that no Seller shall have any Liability whatsoever to any Buyer arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Applicable Consents or because
of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof, and that if the
Closing occurs prior to obtaining each of such Applicable Consents, Buyers and
the Seller Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts as promptly as
possible after Closing to obtain in writing any such Applicable Consents or to
procure a reasonably satisfactory alternative arrangement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the provisions of this sentence shall not apply with respect
to any Applicable Consent that is a Required Consent. Each Buyer further
agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Company, Trillium
UK and Trillium Germany contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached
as a result of (a) the failure to obtain any such Applicable Consent, (b) any
such termination or (c) any Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf
of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such
Applicable Consent or any such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

Consent that is a Required Consent.

Trillium UK and Trillium Germany) shall not, nor shall any of their respective
Affiliates, without the approval of the Sellers Representative or US Buyer,
as applicable, divulge or disclose in any way or issue any press releases or
otherwise make any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the terms and conditions hereof, including
the Purchase Price or any other financial terms, except to the extent required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or stock market, in which case the Party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the Sellers Representative or
US Buyer, as applicable, reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance; _provided_ that each of the Company,
Trillium UK, Trillium Germany and Buyers may make internal announcements to
their respective employees that are consistent with the prior public
disclosures made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.9_
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

7.10 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) _Seller Group Tax Returns_. US Seller or its Affiliates shall prepare and
file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns reporting Taxes of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or other affiliated group of which any Target
Company and any Seller, and/or its direct or indirect regarded parents, are
members, and shall pay all Taxes reflected thereon.

 



 

(ii) _Non-Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 7.10(a)(i)_, the Target Companies, under the direction and control
of US Seller, shall prepare and file, in each case at such Target Companys
expense, all Tax Returns of such Target Company, if any, for all taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the
Closing Date, and shall pay all Taxes reflected thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) _Straddle Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
7.10(a)(i)_, US Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed, (in each case in a manner consistent with past practice) any Tax
Returns of the Target Companies for periods that begin on or before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), at the
Target Companies expense. Within a commercially reasonable amount of time
prior to filing, US Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative with
copies of all such Straddle Period Tax Returns for its review and consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Taxes_. In the case of Taxes arising in a Straddle Period,
except as provided in the next sentence, the allocation of such Taxes between
the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period portions of the Straddle
Period shall be made on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the
end of the Closing Date. In the case of any real property, personal property
or similar ad valorem Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period (other than
a Transfer Tax), the portion of such Tax that relates to the Pre-Closing
Period portion of the Straddle Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
(and including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyers, Sellers and the Target Companies
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon request by the other Parties) the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other Proceeding.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other similar taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyers when due. Each
Buyer, as the case may be, will file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, the expenses of which
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by
Buyers when due, and, if required by applicable Laws, Sellers will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(e) _No Closing Date Tax Actions_. No Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall
cause to be made any extraordinary transaction or event on the Closing Date
that would reasonably be expected to result in any increased Tax Liability for
which any Seller would be required to provide indemnification or otherwise
bear pursuant to this Agreement, except as required by applicable Law. Except
as provided in this Agreement, no Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall make or
cause to be made any election under Section 336(e) of the Code, or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers
Representative will consider in good faith a written request delivered by US
Buyer to the Sellers Representative at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing to implement an election filed with the Internal Revenue Service to
treat Trillium Germany and/or Trillium Australia as a disregarded entity for
US federal

 



      
 

 



 

income tax purposes as of a date no later than the last Business Day prior to
the Closing Date. Buyers may make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code
(including a protective election) with respect to the purchase and sale of
Trillium UK, Trillium Germany and/or Trillium Australia; provided, that any
such election or elections made pursuant to this sentence shall only be made
with the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(f) _Additional Restrictions for Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns and Associated
Taxes_. No Buyer shall, without prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, file (except in the manner set forth in _Section
7.10(a)(iii)_), re-file or amend, or permit any Target Company to file (except
in the manner set forth in _Section 7.10(a)(ii)_), re-file or amend, any Tax
Return of a Target Company that was due on or prior to the Closing Date or for
any Straddle Period, or enter or permit a Target Company to enter into
discussions regarding any voluntary disclosure involving Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period, except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Tax Refunds_. After the Closing, if any Buyer or any Target Company
receives a refund of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Period of any Target
Company, US Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of such Tax refund
to the Sellers Representative within 15 days after receipt thereof;
_provided_ that (i) such Taxes were actually paid by a Target Company, (ii)
such Tax refund is actually received by a Buyer or a Target Company after the
Closing, (iii) such Tax refund does not arise as the result of a carryback of
a loss or other Tax benefit from a taxable period Post-Closing Period, and
(iv) such Tax refund was not provided for or otherwise reflected in the
Closing Net Working Capital.

 



 

(h) _Closing Date Tax Period Matters_. If any of the Target Companies is
permitted but not required under applicable state, local or foreign income Tax
Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the
Parties shall take and cause their Affiliates to take, such steps as may be
reasonably necessary to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable
period.

 



 

(i) _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Allocation Matters_.

 



 

(i) US Seller shall join with US Buyer in timely making elections under (A)
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and (B) any similar provision of state or local
Tax Law with respect to US Buyers purchase of the US Purchased Shares
pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Section 338 Elections_") and
shall join in any filings that may be necessary in order to effect the Section
338 Elections, including IRS Forms 8023 and 8883, and any comparable state or
local Tax forms. US Buyer and US Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, take all actions requested in writing
by US Buyer or the Sellers Representative that are reasonably necessary and
appropriate to effect and preserve timely Section 338 Elections. US Buyer and
US Seller shall execute such forms or documents as are required by any Tax
laws to effect the Section 338 Elections.

 



 

(ii) (A) The US Purchase Price as increased by any applicable amounts treated
as assumed liabilities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other amounts
treated as sales consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) shall be

 



      
 

 



 

allocated among the Assets of the Company as set forth in _Exhibit E-1_
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Assets of Trillium
Australia in the event an election is made pursuant to Section 338(g) of the
Code with respect to Trillium Australia) prepared by the Sellers
Representative, as adjusted based on the US Closing Purchase Price (the " _US
Asset Allocation_ "). Any subsequent adjustments to the US Purchase Price (as
relevant) shall be reflected in an amended US Asset Allocation prepared by the
Sellers Representative and delivered to US Buyer in a form reasonably
acceptable to US Buyer. The Parties shall prepare all books and records, and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883), in a
manner consistent with the US Asset Allocation (as amended), and not take any
action inconsistent therewith.

 



 

(B) The UK Closing Purchase Price as increased by any applicable amounts
treated as assumed liabilities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other
amounts treated as sales consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes
shall be allocated among the Assets of Trillium UK as set forth in _Exhibit
E-2_ prepared by the Sellers Representative, as adjusted based on the UK
Closing Purchase Price (the " _UK Asset Allocation_ "). Any subsequent
adjustments to the UK Closing Purchase Price (as relevant) shall be reflected
in an amended UK Asset Allocation prepared by the Sellers Representative and
delivered to US Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to US Buyer. The Parties
shall prepare all books and records, and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the UK Asset Allocation (as amended), and
not take any action inconsistent therewith.

 



 

(C) The German Closing Purchase Price in the event that an election with the
Internal Revenue Service is made to treat Trillium Germany as a disregarded
entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes effective as of or prior to the
Closing Date or an election is made pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code
with respect to the purchase and sale of Trillium Germany pursuant to this
Agreement (in each case, as increased by any applicable amounts treated as
assumed liabilities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other amounts
treated as sales consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) shall be
allocated among the Assets of Trillium Germany as set forth in _Exhibit E-3_
prepared by the Sellers Representative, as adjusted based on the German
Closing Purchase Price (the " _German Asset Allocation_ "). Any subsequent
adjustments to the German Closing Purchase Price (as relevant) shall be
reflected in an amended German Asset Allocation prepared by the Sellers
Representative and delivered to US Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to US
Buyer. The Parties shall prepare all books and records, and file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the German Asset
Allocation (as amended), and not take any action inconsistent therewith.

 



 

(iii) The Parties intend and agree that the Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be
treated as made pursuant to a deemed plan of liquidation of the Company (and,
to the extent relevant, any other Target Company) in accordance with Treas.
Reg. § 1.338(h)(10)-1(e), Example 2, and shall prepare all books, records and
filings in a manner consistent with such plan and shall not take any actions
inconsistent with such plan.

 



      
 

 



 

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For the benefit of the Employees, as of the Closing, and for a period of
12 months thereafter, US Buyer agrees to (i) provide or cause the Target
Companies to provide the Employees with base salary, wage, annual bonus
opportunity and commission rates (but excluding severance or any equity
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to those in
effect for such Employees immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) either
(A) maintain or cause its Affiliates or the Target Companies to maintain the
Company Benefit Plans at the benefit levels that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar (on a collective basis including all Employees) to the
Employees than are in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing (but
excluding pension benefits) or (B) provide or cause its Affiliates or the
Target Companies to provide employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable to the Employees than those in effect for similarly situated
employees of US Buyer.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Buyer Benefit Plan (including, for the purposes of
this _Section 7.11_ any Company Benefit Plan which is continued by US Buyer
or any Affiliate from and after the Closing) following the Closing and in
which any of the Employees participate, and except to the extent necessary to
avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, accrual of, and entitlement to, benefits (other than
defined benefit pension benefits), service with any Target Company (or
predecessor employers to the extent any Target Company recognized such past
service credit prior to the Closing) shall, be treated as service with US
Buyer and its Affiliates. US Buyer shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each applicable Buyer Benefit Plan to waive eligibility waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements and pre-existing condition
limitations to the extent waived or not included under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan. US Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to
credit the Employees under the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan for amounts paid
prior to the Closing during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Buyer Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer is accepting any sponsorship of the
Harte-Hanks, Inc. Pension Plan or the Restoration Pension Plan and is not
accepting a transfer of assets or Liabilities from such plans. As such, no
Buyer shall incur Liability with respect to, on account of, or be required to
contribute to the Harte-Hanks, Inc. Pension Plan or the Restoration Pension
Plan. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 7.11_ with respect to employees of the Target Companies are included
for the sole benefit of the respective Parties and shall not create any right
(i) in any other person, including employees, former employees, any
participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Benefit Plan, Target
Company employment agreement, Buyer Benefit Plan or Buyer employment agreement
or (ii) to continued employment with any Target Company, any Buyer or any
Affiliates thereof. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.11_ to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
treated as an amendment or other modification of, or limit the ability of any
Target Company, any Buyer or any Affiliates thereof to amend, modify or
terminate, any Company Benefit Plan, Company employment Agreement, Buyer
Benefit Plan, Buyer employment agreement or any other employee benefit plans
of any Target Company or any Buyer or of any Affiliate thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

7.12 _Use of Name_. Each Buyer agrees that it shall have no right to use of
the name "Harte Hanks" or any service marks, trademarks, trade names,
identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or
containing or comprising the foregoing, including any name or mark confusingly
similar thereto (collectively, the " _Harte Hanks Marks_ "), and will not at
any time hold itself out as having any affiliation with any Seller or any of
its Affiliates. As promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than 30
days following the Closing, US Buyer shall change the names of Trillium UK,
Trillium Germany and Trillium Australia such that the names of such entities
thereafter do not contain the words "Harte", "Hanks," "Harte Hanks" or any
similar words. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, (i) as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 90 days following the
Closing Date (such period, the " _Usage Period_ "), each Buyer shall remove,
strike over or otherwise obliterate all Harte Hanks Marks from all materials
in such Buyers or its Affiliates possession including, without limitation,
business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other materials
in such Buyers or its Affiliates possession and (ii) Buyers shall be
permitted to use the Harte Hanks Marks during the Usage Period, provided that,
such use (a) shall be limited to using such Harte Hanks Marks only on such
assets and materials which utilized such Harte Hanks Marks at the time of
Closing, and (b) shall be in a manner consistent with such usage at the time
of Closing.

 



 

7.13 _Termination of Certain Obligations. _Except as set forth on Section 7.13
of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Continuing Affiliate Agreements_ "), (x)
prior to the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause the Company, Trillium
UK and Trillium Germany and any applicable Subsidiary of the Company, Trillium
UK or Trillium Germany to, terminate any Contracts between the Company,
Trillium UK, Trillium Germany and/or any of their Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, on the other hand (the "
_Affiliate Agreements_ "), and (y) any amounts or obligations owing by the
Company, Trillium UK or Trillium Germany or any of their Subsidiaries to any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller (the " _Affiliate Obligations_ ") shall
be canceled at such time without any payment being made in respect thereof.

 



 

7.14 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "), each Seller,
for itself and on behalf of each of its controlled Affiliates other than the
Target Companies (each, a " _Seller Restricted Party_ "), agrees, in addition
to any other obligation imposed by this _Section 7.14_, that such Seller
Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, through any other Person,
during the Non-Compete Period, engage in, render any services to, have any
ownership in (other than as a passive owner of not more than 5% of the
outstanding stock of any class of a corporation that is publicly traded, so
long as the Seller Restricted Party has no active participation in the
business of such corporation), participate in the financing, operation,
management or control of, or assist any other Person to engage in, whether as
an employee, independent contractor, consultant, partner, shareholder or
otherwise, a business which is competitive with or similar to the Business as
conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing anywhere in the
world. In addition, no Seller Restricted Party shall, at any time, represent
that it is continuing to carry on the Business or operations of any Target
Company, and each Seller Restricted Party shall immediately inform any Person
that inquires about any Target Company that the Target Companies have been
sold to Buyers, and such Seller Restricted Party shall promptly inform US
Buyer of such inquiry.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Seller Restricted Party further agrees that, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fourth anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Non-Solicit Period_ "), such Seller Restricted Party
shall not, directly or indirectly, through any other Person in any manner (i)
induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Target Companies, any Buyer or
any Subsidiary of any Buyer that is engaged in the Business at the Closing
Date to terminate employment with such entity or solicit or attempt to solicit
any such employee ( _provided_ that general solicitations for employment that
are not specifically targeted at any such employees or groups of employees
shall not be prohibited hereby) or hire any such employee within 12 months of
such termination of employment, or (ii) solicit or entice, or attempt to
solicit or entice, any customers, suppliers, licensees, licensors, clients or
distributors of any Target Company for purposes of diverting their business or
services from any Target Company.

 



 

(c) Each Buyer, for itself and on behalf of each of its controlled Affiliates
(each, a " _Buyer Restricted Party_ "), agrees that, during the Non-Solicit
Period, such Buyer Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, through
any other Person in any manner induce or attempt to induce any employee of any
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies) with an
annual salary in excess of $100,000 at the Closing Date to terminate
employment with such entity or solicit or attempt to solicit any such employee
( _provided_ that general solicitations for employment that are not
specifically targeted at any such employees or groups of employees shall not
be prohibited hereby) or hire any such employee within three months of such
termination of employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that for the 90 day period
immediately following the Closing, the restrictions in this _Section 7.14(c)_
shall not apply with respect to the individuals listed in Section 7.14(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) Each Seller Restricted Party further agrees that, from and after the
Closing Date, such Seller Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any other Person make or publish, verbally or in writing, any
statements concerning any Buyer, the Target Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives which
statements are injurious to any Buyer, the Target Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such restrictions shall not apply to any confidential
communications with any Governmental Entity (including communications made in
the course of any government investigation).

 



 

(e) Each Buyer Restricted Party agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
such Buyer Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, through any
other Person make or publish, verbally or in writing, any statements
concerning any Seller, any Non-Company Affiliate or any of their respective
Representatives which statements are injurious to any Seller, any Non-Company
Affiliate or any of their respective Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such restrictions shall not apply to any confidential communications with
any Governmental Entity (including communications made in the course of any
government investigation).

 



 

(f) The terms of this _Section 7.14_ shall apply to any Seller Restricted
Party and any Buyer Restricted Party that is not one of the Parties to the
same extent as if it were a party hereto, and each Seller and each Buyer,
respectively, shall take whatever actions may be necessary to cause any of its
controlled Affiliates to adhere to the terms of this _Section 7.14_.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) If any Governmental Entity determines that the foregoing restrictions are
too broad or otherwise unreasonable under applicable Law, including with
respect to time or space, such Governmental Entity is hereby requested and
authorized by the Parties to revise the foregoing restriction to include the
maximum restrictions allowable under applicable Law. Each Seller Restricted
Party acknowledges, however, that this _Section 7.14_ has been negotiated by
the Parties and that the geographical and time limitations, as well as the
limitation on activities, are reasonable in light of the circumstances
pertaining to the Business and operations of the Target Companies.

 



 

(h) In the event of any breach or threatened breach by any Seller Restricted
Party or any Buyer Restricted Party of any provision of this _Section 7.14_,
as applicable, Buyers or Sellers, respectively, shall be entitled to
injunctive or other equitable relief, without the obligation to post bond or
similar security, restraining such party from engaging in conduct that would
constitute a breach of the obligations of such party under this _Section
7.14_. Such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other
remedies that may be available, including an action for the recovery of Losses
(which Losses, if any, shall not be subject to any of the limitations under
_Article IX_).

 



 

7.15 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement,
US Buyer is obtaining the "buyers" representations and warranties insurance
policy from Great American EandS Insurance Company attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_ (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_"). The RandW Insurance Policy provides that
the insurer may only exercise any subrogation rights against any Seller if and
to the extent the applicable Loss arose in whole or part out of such Sellers
fraud in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The cost for implementing the RandW Insurance Policy shall be borne at
the Closing (i) by Sellers for such amount up to $500,000 (it being agreed and
understood that such amount shall constitute Company Transaction Expenses) and
(ii) by Buyers for any cost in excess of $500,000 (it being agreed and
understood that such amount shall constitute Buyer Transaction Expenses).

 



 

7.16 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. The Seller Parties shall cause the Pre-
Closing Restructuring to be completed as soon as reasonably practicable after
the execution of this Agreement but in no event later than immediately prior
to the Closing as contemplated by _Schedule A_ hereto. Sellers shall keep
Buyers reasonably informed as to the Pre-Closing Restructuring, shall consider
in good faith revisions to _Schedule A_ as reasonably requested by Buyers in
writing and shall provide Buyers with the opportunity to review and comment on
the documentation relating to the Pre-Closing Restructuring, which
documentation shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyers.

 



 

7.17 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) US Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, including taking, or causing to be taken, all actions and
doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, and (ii) shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under the Commitment Letter or any related fee
letters without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative;
provided that US Buyer may amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar

 



      
 

 



 

entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement, or otherwise replace or amend the Commitment Letter, in each case,
so long as such action would not (A) reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing, (B) expand on, or provide for additional, conditions
precedent to the initial funding of the Financing or (C) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing at the Closing below an amount sufficient (when taken
together with Buyers other available funds) to enable Buyers to pay the
Estimated Purchase Price and the fees and expenses of Buyers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required to be paid at
the Closing.

 



 

(b) US Buyer shall maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and negotiate
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on substantially the terms
and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (after giving effect to any
"market flex" provisions contained in any fee letters, which fee letters shall
be disclosed in a customary redacted form to the Sellers Representative).
Upon the request of the Sellers Representative from time to time, US Buyer
shall keep the Sellers Representative informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of US Buyers efforts to arrange the
Financing. In the event that all conditions in the Commitment Letter have been
satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, US Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund on the Closing
Date the financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that all or a portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable, US Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
replacement financing on terms not materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to US Buyer than those under the Commitment Letter from alternative
sources as promptly as practicable in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and in such case references in
this Agreement to the Commitment Letter shall be deemed to refer also to the
agreements under which such replacement commitments are provided, references
in this Agreement to the Financing shall be deemed to refer also to the
financing contemplated thereby, and all obligations of US Buyer pursuant to
this Section 7.17 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as with
respect to the Commitment Letter and the Financing). For the purposes of this
Agreement, references to the "Commitment Letter" shall include such documents
as permitted or required by this Section 7.17 to be amended, modified or
replaced, in each case from and after such amendment, modification or
replacement and references to the "Financing" shall include any such modified
or alternative debt financing.

 



 

(c) US Buyer shall give the Sellers Representative prompt notice of any
breach, default of, or actual withdrawal, repudiation or termination in
writing by, any party to the Commitment Letter or of any condition not likely
to be satisfied, in each case, of which US Buyer becomes aware or any
termination of the Commitment Letter.

 



 

7.18 _Cooperation with Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of the Seller Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide, and shall cause the other Target Companies to use
reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to

Buyers sole cost and expense, such cooperation as may reasonably be requested
by US Buyer that is customary and necessary in connection with arranging and

each case to the extent that the same is reasonably requested or is otherwise
expressly required by the Commitment Letter):

December 31, 2016;

 



 

(iv) furnishing US Buyer and the Financing Sources with all other financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Business as is required by the
Commitment Letter and reasonably requested by US Buyer; provided, that no such

(a)(i) above) shall require the preparation by any Seller Party, Target
Company or the Business of pro forma financial or other pro forma information
not currently available as of the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(v) facilitating delivery at the Closing of customary evidence of property and
liability insurance, including endorsements in favor of the Financing Sources;

 



 

(vi) executing and delivering such documents, instruments, certificates or

rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act) so long as any such
documents, instruments certificates or information are requested by US Buyer
at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(vii) delivering such officers certificates as are customary in financings of
such type (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of US Seller
with respect to solvency matters in the form attached to the Commitment
Letter) and as are, in the good faith determination of the Person(s) executing
such certificates, accurate in all material respects, and agreeing to pledge,
grant security interests in, and otherwise grant Liens on, the Assets pursuant
to such agreements, documents, instruments and certificates as may be
reasonably requested (including such agreements, documents or certificates
that facilitate the creation, perfection or enforcement of Liens securing the
Financing (including original copies of all certificated securities (with
transfer powers executed in blank)) as may be reasonably requested by US
Buyer, and executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and
otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral); _provided_ that no

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) US Buyer shall ensure that such requested

understood and agreed that neither any Seller nor any Target Company shall be
required to take any action that unreasonably interferes with the Business);
(2) neither any Seller nor any Target Company nor any of their respective
Representatives, shall, in connection with the Financing: (A) be required to
take any action that would result in a violation of applicable Law or breach

Liability under any Definitive Financing Agreement or any related document or
other agreement or document related to the Financing, other than any such
Liability of any Target Company following the Closing; (C) be required to
incur any other Liability in connection with the Financing, other than any
other Liability incurred by any Target Company following the Closing; (D) be
required to disclose or provide any information the disclosure of which, in
the reasonable judgment of any Seller or any Target Company supported by

trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligation of any Seller or any
Target Company with respect to confidentiality; (E) be required to enter into
or perform under any agreement with respect to the Financing that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to or
simultaneous with the Closing, or (F) be required to waive or amend any terms

the Closing for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of any Buyer.

 



 

(b) US Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Sellers Representative,
reimburse Sellers and the Target Companies and/or their respective
Representatives for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs

disposition of any Proceeding) directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by
the Financing Indemnitees in connection with the Financing, including any
information provided in connection therewith or the cooperation by any Seller
or any Target Company with respect thereto, in each case, other than to the
extent arising out of any Sellers, any Target Companys or any of their
respective Representatives gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
This _Section 7.18(b)_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Closing and any termination of this

Indemnitees and their respective heirs, executors, estates, personal
representatives, successors and assigns, and shall be binding on all
successors and permitted assigns of Buyers.

otherwise adversely affect any Seller Party or any other Target Company.

 



 

(d) Each Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, other than the obligations to
cooperate expressly set forth in this _Section 7.18_, no Seller or any Target
Company has any responsibility or liability in relation to any financing that
any Buyer may seek or obtain in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

7.19 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall,
and shall cause the other Target Companies to: (i) afford each Buyer and its

Buyer and its Representatives with such financial, operating and other data
and information related to the Target Companies as such Buyer or any of its
Representatives may reasonably request; and (iii) instruct their respective

unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Target
Companies and no Buyer shall have any right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the properties or facilities of any Seller Parties without
the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (which consent may be
withheld for any or no reason). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (a) no such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent
that (i) it could unreasonably disrupt the operations of any Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) it would reasonably be expected to cause significant
competitive harm to any Seller or its Subsidiaries if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or (iii) any Seller
determines that such access or examination would (A) jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege (it being agreed that the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of this clause (A) apply) or (B)
contravene any Law or Contract (it being agreed that Sellers and the Company,
Trillium UK and Trillium Germany shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any required consent under any such Contract to permit such access or
examination).

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal
business hours, in connection with the preparation of financial statements and

Target Companies for the 2017 fiscal year, except as determined in good faith
to be necessary to (i) ensure compliance with any applicable Law, (ii)
preserve any applicable privilege (including the attorney-client privilege) or
(iii) comply with any contractual confidentiality obligations, each Seller
shall, and shall cause the Non-Company Affiliates to, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its

 



      
 

 



 

and their respective Representatives to, (A) furnish or cause to be furnished
to each Buyer, its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the

Business in the possession or control of any Seller or any Non-Company
Affiliates as any Buyer or its Representatives may from time to time

the Non-Company Affiliates whose assistance, expertise, notes and
recollections or presence may be necessary to assist any Buyer in connection
with its inquiries for any of the purposes referred to above; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of any Seller or any of the Non-Company Affiliates;
_provided_ , further, that no Seller shall be required to produce additional
business records or reports not produced in the ordinary course of the
existing Business. The provisions of _Section 7.7(b)_ shall apply to any
information provided to or obtained by any Buyer, any of its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Target Companies) or any of their
respective Representatives, _mutatis mutandis_.

Sellers Representative shall

 



      
 

 



 

promptly (but in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt thereof)

received by any Seller Party or any other Target Company between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, which notice shall include the identity of the
Person making or submitting such indication of interest, inquiry, proposal,
offer or request, and the terms and conditions thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this _Section 7.20_ shall in any
way limit the ability of any Seller or its Affiliates and Representatives to
(i) take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage any proposal relating to
the business of such Seller other than the Business, the Company or any other
Target Company (an " _Other Proposal_ "), (ii) engage in negotiations or
discussions, or enter into any agreement or understanding, relating to any
Other Proposal, (iii) provide or disclose any information relating to any
Seller, or afford access to the employees, properties, books, contracts or

7.21 _General Release of Sellers_. Each Seller, on behalf of itself and its

irrevocably releases, acquits and forever discharges the Target Companies,
their respective Affiliates (other than the Seller Releasing Parties),
predecessors, successors and assigns (including each Buyer and its Affiliates)
and their respective officers, directors, managers, partners and employees
(collectively the " _Target Company Released Parties_ "), from any and all
rights, claims, debts, Liabilities, causes of action, obligations and Losses
(whether for compensatory, special, incidental or punitive Losses, equitable
relief or otherwise) of any kind or nature whatsoever, past, present, or
future, at law, in equity or otherwise (including with respect to conduct
which is negligent, grossly negligent, willful, intentional, with or without
malice, or a breach of any duty or Law), whether known or unknown, whether
fixed or contingent, whether concealed or hidden, whether disclosed or
undisclosed, whether liquidated or unliquidated, whether foreseeable or
unforeseeable, whether anticipated or unanticipated, whether suspected or
unsuspected, which such Seller Releasing Parties, or any of them, ever have
had or ever in the future may have against the Target Company Released
Parties, or any of them, and which are based on acts, events or omissions
existing, occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing (collectively, the "
_Seller Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
release shall not release, impair or diminish, and the term "Seller Released
Claims" shall not include, in any respect, any rights under this Agreement or
under any other Transaction Document. Each Seller, on behalf of itself and
each Seller Releasing Party, hereby waives any rights it may have under any
Law which provides that a general release does not extend to claims which the
releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in its favor at the time of
executing the release, which if known by it may have materially affected its
settlement. Each Seller, on behalf of itself and each Seller Releasing Party,
acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts in addition to or different
from those which it now knows or believes to be true with respect to the
subject matter of the claims released hereby, but each Seller, on behalf of
itself and each Seller Releasing Party, intends to and, by operation of this
release shall have, fully, finally and forever settled and released any and
all Seller Released Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery of
existence of such different or additional facts.

excess of the number of software licenses listed in Section 3.2(a)(xvii) of
the Disclosure Schedule are necessary in connection with any existing
customers of any Target Company as of the Closing Date and their use of any
product referenced in Section 3.2(a)(xvii) of the Disclosure Schedule, then US
Seller shall promptly upon written request by US Buyer and upon delivery by US
Buyer of reasonable supporting evidence, either (a) fully pay for, or cause to
be fully paid for, such additional licenses or (b) reimburse, or cause to be
reimbursed, US Buyer or the applicable Target Company, for such additional

rights to use or file new applications to register the marks "HARTE-HANKS
TRILLIUM" or "HARTE-HANKS." The Parties further agree that nothing in this
Agreement transfers or conveys any rights to any Buyer in the mark "HARTE-
HANKS." Each Seller agrees to not use the "HARTE-HANKS TRILLIUM" or "TRILLIUM"
marks or file new applications to register the marks "HARTE-HANKS TRILLIUM" or
"TRILLIUM." Each Seller confirms that a Buyer or a Target Company can maintain
ownership of and title to the Brazil Mark indefinitely and that neither any
Buyer nor any Target Company is under any obligation to maintain the
registration for the Brazil Mark.

 



 

7.26 _Resignation Letters_. The Company, Trillium UK and Trillium Germany
shall, and the Seller Parties shall cause the other Target Companies to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at or prior to the Closing,
resignations, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_, from each director
and each officer of the Target Companies listed in Section 3.2(a)(xiii) of the
Disclosure Schedule, which resignations include the bracketed release language
set forth therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that obtaining releases that
contain such bracketed release language shall not be a condition to Closing.

 



 

7.27 _Certain Intellectual Property Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Retained Technology_. To the extent there is any Intellectual Property
that is owned or licensed by any Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate as of the
Closing that (i) was at any time during the one-year period prior to the
Closing used by any Target Company, (ii) is not

 



      
 

 



 

transferred to any Buyer or any Target Company at the Closing in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) is useful or
otherwise necessary to any Target Company in connection with conducting the
Business by any such Target Company after the Closing (the " _Retained
Technology_ "), each Seller hereby unconditionally grants to each Target
Company and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable,
transferable (in connection with a merger, acquisition, change in control or
similar such transaction involving such Target Company or its successors or
assigns), worldwide, fully-paid right and license, with the right to
sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, under all of any Sellers
Intellectual Property rights in any and all Retained Technology, (i) to
reproduce, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform, publicly
display, digitally transmit, and otherwise use the Retained Technology in any
medium or format, whether now known or hereafter discovered, (ii) to use,
make, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit any
product or service based on, embodying, incorporating, or derived from the
Retained Technology, and (iii) to exercise any and all other present or future
rights in the Retained Technology. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent any such Retained Technology is licensed by any Seller or any Non-
Company Affiliate from a third party and any Seller or any Non-Company
Affiliate is subject to limitations under the applicable third party license
that prevent any Seller from granting the foregoing license to each Target
Company and its Affiliates, the foregoing license is subject to such
limitations as to such Retained Technology. Prior to the Closing, US Seller
shall procure from each of its Non-Company Affiliates owning or licensing
Retained Technology all rights necessary for Sellers to grant the foregoing
license to each Target Company and its Affiliates in such Retained Technology.

 



 

(b) _Domain Names_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall transfer, or cause to
be transferred, ownership of the domain names listed on Section 7.27(b) of the

compete agreements entered into between any Seller (and/or any of their
respective corporate Affiliates) and any Employee or any former employee of
any Target Company, and all right, title and interest in and to any and all
inventions, works of authorship, software and other technology created by such
Employee thereunder, in each case solely to the extent not already exclusively

is not a Seller under this Agreement, prior to Closing Seller shall provide a
copy of the applicable assignment agreement conveying the foregoing right,
title and interest.

interest, penalty, damage, Tax, demand, injury, judgment, settlement, award,
fine, fee (including reasonable attorneys fees), cost (including reasonable
costs of investigation) or expense (collectively, " _Losses_ ") caused by or
resulting from:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty of Sellers
or the Company, Trillium UK or Trillium Germany, as applicable, set forth in
_Article IV_ and _Article V_ or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf
of any Seller or the Company, Trillium UK or Trillium Germany, as applicable,
with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any breach prior to the Closing by the Seller Parties or the Sellers
Representative (in its capacity as such) or following the Closing by any
Seller or the Sellers Representative (in its capacity as such) of their
respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) without duplication of any rights to recovery or indemnity set forth
herein, and calculated by excluding any additional interest, penalties or
other Taxes that arise solely from the non-payment or untimely payment of
Taxes with respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by any Buyer pursuant
to _Section 7.10_ or any Taxes required to be paid by any Buyer pursuant to
_Section 7.10_, (A) all unpaid Taxes of any Target Company for the Pre-
Closing Period, (B) any unpaid Taxes of any Seller, and (C) any Taxes required
to be paid by any Seller pursuant to _Section 7.10_, in each case including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes incurred in connection with or arising
from the Pre-Closing Restructuring;

 



 

(iv) any Closing Indebtedness not accounted for in the calculation of the
Final Purchase Price;

 



      
 

 



 

(v) any Company Transaction Expenses not accounted for in the calculation of
the Final Purchase Price; or

 



 

(vi) any matter referred to in Section 9.2(a)(vi) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by US Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth
herein, from and after the Closing, US Buyer shall indemnify and defend each
Seller, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees,
successors and permitted assigns against, and shall hold each of them harmless
from, any Losses caused by or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty of Buyers
set forth in _Article VI_ or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of
any Buyer with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyers (and following the
Closing the Target Companies, solely with respect to any covenant or agreement
to be performed following the Closing) contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) (A) any Taxes of a Target Company attributable to the Post-Closing
Period, (B) fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes and (C) any Taxes of any
Buyer or an Affiliate of any Buyer (other than a Target Company); or

 



 

(iv) any Buyer Transaction Expenses.

 



 

9.3 _Indemnification Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall not be liable for any Losses (i) unless the Claim for such
Losses is brought prior to the Claim Release Date, other than a Claim based on
a breach of a Fundamental Representation, which Claim must be brought prior to
the applicable Extended Release Date, (ii) unless and until the amount of any
individual Loss or group of related Losses with respect to any Claim pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), it
being understood that (A) any such individual Claim or group of related claims
for amounts less than the Per Claim Threshold shall be ignored in determining
whether the Deductible has been exceeded and (B) the Per Claim Threshold shall
not apply to Claims based on a breach of a Fundamental Representation or a
Specified Representation, and (iii) unless and until the aggregate amount of
Losses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any Claim pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ exceeds $840,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case
Seller shall be liable only for the amount of such indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Deductible shall
not apply to Claims based on a breach of a Fundamental Representation or a
Specified Representation. In no event shall Sellers be obligated to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ in excess of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not
apply to Claims based on a breach of a Fundamental Representation. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to recover
an amount of Losses under _Section 9.2(a)_ pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article IX_, such amount shall be recoverable, first, out of the then-
outstanding Indemnity Escrow Funds, then, if such funds are insufficient to
cover the amount of Losses for which such Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
recover via direct recovery from Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall either
Sellers, on the one hand, or US Buyer, on the other hand, be liable for any
amount in excess of the Base Purchase Price in connection with Claims under
this _Article IX_.

 



 

(b) Furthermore, no Claim for indemnification may be made or pursued (and each
Party, as applicable, expressly waives any right to indemnification) (i) for
any matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule or (ii) by any Buyer or any
of its successors or assigns, after the Purchased Shares, Assets or business
to which the Claim relates cease to be owned by or controlled by such Buyer.

 



 

(c) Each Indemnitee must use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate in
accordance with applicable Law any Losses for which such Indemnitee seeks
indemnification hereunder, including seeking recovery under any available
insurance policies (including, if applicable, under the RandW Insurance Policy).
If the Indemnitee mitigates its Losses after the Indemnitor has paid the
Indemnitee under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of
such same Losses, the Indemnitee must notify the Indemnitor and pay to the
Indemnitor to the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnitee of that
mitigation which would otherwise result in duplicative recovery ( _less_ the
Indemnitees reasonable costs of mitigation) within five Business Days after
the benefit is received. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Cap and the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not
apply to claims for indemnification brought upon a finding of fraud by the
Company, Trillium UK, Trillium Germany or any Seller by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount of any Losses
for which indemnification is provided under this _Article IX_ shall be net of
(i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee pursuant to any
indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, (ii) any
insurance proceeds (including, in the case of a Buyer Indemnitee, any proceeds
under the RandW Insurance Policy) or other cash receipts or sources of
reimbursement actually received by the Indemnitee (and no right of subrogation
shall accrue to any insurer or third party indemnitor hereunder) (each such
Person named in clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Collateral Source_ ") and (iii) an
amount equal to the Tax benefit, if any, actually realized by the Indemnitee
as a result of such Losses in the taxable year such Losses are incurred. If
the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under this
_Article IX_ is determined after payment by the Indemnitor of any amount
otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_,
the Indemnitee shall repay to the Indemnitor, promptly after such
determination, any amount that the Indemnitor would not have had to pay
pursuant to this _Section 9.3(d)_ and would result in duplicative recovery by
the Indemnitee had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

 



 

(e) With respect to Losses for which any Buyer Indemnitee is indemnified under
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to claims based on a breach of a
Fundamental Representation), at no time will such Buyer Indemnitee be entitled
to recover (i) more than the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Funds then
remaining and any amounts recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy or (ii)
from any source other than the Indemnity Escrow Funds and the RandW Insurance
Policy. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, after the
Closing, on and after the date that the then-remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds
are reduced to zero, the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no further rights to
indemnification under this _Article IX_ with respect to Losses for which the
Buyer Indemnitees are indemnified under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_

 



      
 

 



 

(other than with respect to claims based on a breach of a Fundamental
Representation and notwithstanding any rights that may be available under the
RandW Insurance Policy). In the event any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to Losses
hereunder, such Buyer Indemnitee shall first seek to recover from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount prior to seeking direct recovery from Sellers for such
Losses.

 



 

(f) For the purposes of determining the amount of Losses to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to recover under this _Article IX_ and for
purposes of determining whether or not an Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_, each of the representations
and warranties that contains any "Company Material Adverse Effect," "material"
or similar materiality qualifications shall be read as though such
qualifications were not contained therein (other than with respect to (i)
_Section 5.5(a)_, (ii) the first sentence of _Section 5.10_, and (iii) the
use of the term "Material Contract" and any other defined term that includes
the word "Material" in the title).

 



 

(g) Neither any Seller nor any Person claiming by or through any Seller shall
have any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy
against any Target Company in connection with any indemnification obligation
or other Liability to which it may be subject under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

9.4 _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand, or other circumstance or state of
facts which could give rise to any claim or demand, for which an Indemnitor
may be liable to an Indemnitee hereunder (each, a " _Claim_ ") is asserted or
sought to be collected by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnitee shall as soon as practicable notify the Indemnitor in writing of
such Third Party Claim (" _Notice of Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this _Section
9.4(a)_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this
_Article IX_, except to the extent that such Indemnitors ability to remedy,
contest, defend or settle with respect to such Third Party Claim is materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay to give notice. The Notice of Claim shall
(i) state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or
anticipates that it will incur Liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) to the
extent ascertainable, specify in reasonable detail each individual item of
Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated Liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall enclose with
the Notice of Claim a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third
Party Claim, if any, and any other documents evidencing such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that any confidential or privileged materials
shall not be disclosed by the Indemnitee other than as needed for the defense
of the Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitor agrees to enter into a
commercially reasonable confidentiality and non-use agreement with the
Indemnitee with respect to such information.

 



 

(b) The Indemnitor shall have 45 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Notice of Claim to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor
desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any
litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost
and expense (a " _Third Party Defense_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be permitted to assume
the Third Party Defense if: (A) upon petition by the Indemnitee, the
appropriate court determines that the Indemnitor failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim, (B) the Third Party
Claim is in respect of any matter involving criminal liability or asserts
fraud of the Indemnitee, (C) the matter that is the subject of the Third Party
Claim seeks as the primary cause of action the imposition of an equitable or
injunctive remedy against the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (D) the
Third Party Claim seeks damages in excess of the amount for which the
Indemnitor may be liable under this Agreement, (E) the Third Party Claim
involves any Governmental Entity as a party thereto, or (F) the Indemnitor
fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnitee of its financial
capacity to defend such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor assumes the Third
Party Defense in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnitee may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim but the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense
and settlement thereof, _provided_ that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnitor if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnitee, a conflict exists on a material issue between the Indemnitee and
the Indemnitor that would make such separate representation advisable, (ii)
the Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor and (iii) the Indemnitor
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or
settlement (x) provides for equitable relief, (y) involves a finding or
admission of any violation of Law or suggestion of any wrongdoing on behalf of
the Indemnitee, or (z) does not fully and unconditionally release the
Indemnitee from liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, without
prejudice, in each case without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee.
The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from
Third Party Claims and will act in good faith in responding to, defending
against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The Parties shall
also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to
all information relevant thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall
be required to disclose any confidential or privileged materials other than as
needed for the defense of the Third Party Claim, and the receiving Party
agrees to enter into a commercially reasonable confidentiality and non-use
agreement with the disclosing Party with respect to such information. Whether
or not the Indemnitor has assumed the Third Party Defense, such Indemnitor
shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder for any
settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the
Indemnitors prior written consent.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnitor does not or is not entitled to assume the Third Party
Defense within 45 days of receipt of the Notice of Claim, the Indemnitee will
be entitled to assume the Third Party Defense, at the expense of the
Indemnitor (subject to the applicable limitations on Losses herein), upon
delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that the (i)
Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the Third Party Defense at
its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof, (ii) the Indemnitee shall not file any papers
or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
(iii) the Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented
to without the Indemnitors prior written consent.

 



      
 

 



 

9.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
shall provide the Indemnitor a Notice of Claim promptly following its
discovery of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in
this _Section 9.5_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under
this _Article IX_, except to the extent that such Indemnitors ability to
remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect to such Claim is materially
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Such Notice of Claim shall (i)
state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates
that it will incur Liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) to the extent
ascertainable, specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid or properly
accrued, the basis for any anticipated Liability and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and the computation of the amount to which such
Indemnitee claims to be entitled hereunder. The Indemnitee shall reasonably
cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim
for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such
assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and
copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters (subject
to customary exceptions for legal privilege), furnishing employees (upon
advance notice and at mutually convenient times) to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing reasonable
legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.

 



 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
Losses arising out of, relating to or connected with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ (other than (i) as provided in
_Section 11.12_ for specific performance or (ii) with respect to fraud.

 



 

9.7 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification
payment made hereunder as an adjustment to Purchase Price.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X 
TERMINATION**

 



 

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated by written notice of
termination only as follows:

 



 

(a) By mutual written consent of US Buyer and the Sellers Representative at
any time prior to the Closing;

 



 

(b) By US Buyer at any time prior to the Closing if a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Seller
Parties or the Sellers Representative set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which if uncured would cause any condition set forth in _Sections
8.2(a)_ or _8.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of
being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured upon the
earlier to occur of (A) the Outside Date, or (B) otherwise within 30 Business
Days following receipt by the Sellers Representative of written notice of
such breach from US Buyer;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) By the Sellers Representative at any time prior to the Closing if a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Buyers set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which if uncured would
cause any condition set forth in _Sections 8.3(a)_ or _8.3(b)_ not to be
satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured upon the earlier to occur of (A) the Outside
Date, or (B) otherwise within 30 Business Days following receipt by US Buyer
of written notice of such breach from the Sellers Representative;

 



 

(d) By either US Buyer or the Sellers Representative at any time after 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time, on the day that is 90 days following the date of this
Agreement (the " _Outside Date_ ") if the Closing shall not have occurred by
such date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 10.1(d)_ shall not be available to any Party whose
failure to perform any covenant or obligation under this Agreement has caused
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur by the
Outside Date; and

 



 

(e) By the Sellers Representative if (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ (except for those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but which are capable of being satisfied at
the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement
as of the date that the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to
_Section 3.1_, (ii) the Seller Parties have confirmed in writing to US Buyer
that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.3_ have been satisfied
or waived (except for those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but which are capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and
(B) the Seller Parties are ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing,
(iii) US Buyer does not complete the Closing on the day that the Closing
should have been consummated pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and (iv) Buyer fails
to consummate the Closing within three Business Days following receipt of
written notice described in clause (ii) above from the Sellers Representative
requesting such consummation.

 



 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination hereof as
expressly permitted under _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect (except for _Section 7.9_, this _Section
10.2_, _Section 10.3_ and _Article XI_ (other than _Section 11.12_), which
provisions shall survive such termination and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms) and there shall be no Liability in
respect of this Agreement on the part of any of Buyers, the Seller Parties,
the Sellers Representative or their respective officers, directors or
shareholders, except as provided in this _Section 10.2_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to _Section 10.3_, if such termination is due to the
knowing and willful material non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement
herein by either Buyers, on the one hand, or Seller Parties or the Sellers
Representative, on the other hand, such Party shall be fully liable to the
other Party for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) actually incurred in good faith by such other Party in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
for all Losses sustained or incurred by such other Party as a result thereof.
In the event of termination hereunder without Closing, each Party shall return
promptly to the other Party or destroy (and certify such destruction to the
other Party in writing) all documents, work papers and other material of the
other Party furnished or made available to such Party or its Representatives,
and all copies (including electronic copies) thereof, and agrees that no
information received by it or its Representatives shall be revealed by it or
its Representatives to any third party or used for the advantage of such Party
or any other Person.

 



      
 

 



 

10.3 _Buyer Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If the Sellers Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Sections 10.1(c)_ or _10.1(e)_ , then US Buyer shall pay to the Sellers
Representative a fee equal to the amount set forth in Section 10.3(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule in cash (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ "). US Buyer shall
pay the Buyer Termination Fee to the Sellers Representative (to an account
designated in writing by the Sellers Representative) concurrently with such
termination of this Agreement by US Buyer or no later than three Business Days
after the date of the applicable termination by the Sellers Representative.
US Buyer acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 10.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Seller Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If, in order to obtain payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, the
Sellers Representative commences a suit that results in a judgment for the
Sellers Representative requiring US Buyer to pay the Buyer Termination Fee,
US Buyer shall pay the Sellers Representatives reasonable and documented
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred by the Sellers Representative in connection with such suit. In light
of the difficulty of accurately determining actual Losses with respect to the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Buyer Termination Fee, in the
circumstances in which such Buyer Termination Fee becomes payable, constitutes
a reasonable estimate of the Losses that will be suffered by reason of any
such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated damages and is
not a penalty. Under no circumstances shall US Buyer be required to pay the
Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which US Buyer is obligated to
pay the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 10.3_, the payment of
the Buyer Termination Fee and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of the
Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Seller Parties, the Sellers Representative or any of their
Affiliates or any other Seller Related Party against any Buyer, any Financing
Source or prospective Financing Source of such Buyer, any of their respective
direct or indirect former, current and future Affiliates, stockholders,
partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
holders of any Equity Interests, controlling Persons or Representatives, or
any future holders of any Equity Interests, controlling Persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers,
stockholders or assignees of any of the foregoing (the " _Buyer Related
Parties_ ") for any and all Losses that may be suffered based upon, resulting
from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such termination, and
upon payment of the Buyer Termination Fee and, if applicable, such costs and
expenses of the Sellers Representative in accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_,
none of the Buyer Related Parties shall have any further Liability relating to
or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents or otherwise, and no Person will have any rights or claims against
any of the Buyer Related Parties hereunder or thereunder. Upon receipt by the
Sellers Representative of the Buyer Termination Fee and, if applicable, the
costs and expenses of the Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section
10.3(a)_, the Sellers Representative agrees to cause any Proceeding pending
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any Proceeding related to the Financing) by any of the Sellers
Representative, Sellers or the Target Companies against any Buyer or any Buyer
Related Party, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause any such Proceeding
by any other Person against any Buyer or any Buyer Related Party, to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly.

constitute a waiver of such Partys right at any other time or unless it is
made in writing and signed by the Party waiving the condition. No failure by
either Party to take any action with respect to any breach of this Agreement
or default by the other Party shall constitute a waiver of such Partys right
to enforce any provision of this Agreement against such other Party or to take
action with respect to such breach or default or of any subsequent breach or

 



      
 

 



 

default by such other Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, _Section 7.18_, _Section 10.3(b)_, this _Section 11.3_,
_Section 11.4_, _Section 11.8_ and _Section 11.16_ (and any related
definition and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of any such Sections) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

11.4 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that without such prior written consent (a) any Buyer may assign
its rights and/or delegate its obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates, (b) any or all of the rights and interests and/or obligations of
any Buyer under this Agreement may be assigned and/or delegated to any
purchaser of a substantial portion of the assets of such Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (c) each Buyer shall be permitted to collaterally assign, at
any time and in their sole discretion, their respective rights under this
Agreement to any Financing Sources or to any assignee or assignees of such
Financing Sources; _provided_ , further, that in each case such assignment
will not relieve such Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 



 

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto
shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each Party agrees and
acknowledges that the application of the Laws of the State of Delaware is
reasonable and appropriate based upon the Parties respective interests and
contacts with the State of Delaware. Each Party waives any right or interest
in having the Laws of any other state, including specifically, state Law
regarding the statute of limitation or other limitations period, apply to any
Partys state Law claim, controversy or dispute which in any way arises out of
or relates to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County
in the State of Delaware (or, if subject matter jurisdiction in that court is
not available, the state courts located in the City of Wilmington in the State
of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware)
for the purposes of any suit, action or other Proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties agrees
to commence any such action, suit or Proceeding either in the Court of
Chancery in and for New Castle County in the State of Delaware or if such
suit, action or other proceeding may not be brought in such court for
jurisdictional reasons in any state court located in the City of Wilmington,
Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
Each of the Parties further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective address
set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
other Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this _Section 11.6_. Each of the Parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or other Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in (a) the United States District Court

 



      
 

 



 

for the District of Delaware, (b) the Court of Chancery in and for New Castle
County in the State of Delaware or (c) any state court located in Wilmington,
Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or other
Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH
PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING; (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER;
(III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.6_.

 



 

11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts and any Party hereto may execute such counterpart, each of which
when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when all Parties shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other Parties. The Parties agree that the
delivery of this Agreement may be effected by means of an exchange of
facsimile or as an attachment to an electronic mail message in "pdf" or
similar format.

 



 

11.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Financing Sources are express third party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the agreements set forth in _Section
10.3_, _Section 11.3_, _Section 11.4_, this _Section 11.8_ and _Section
11.16_.

 



 

11.9 _Entire Agreement; Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, and Exhibits_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the documents, instruments and other agreements
specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the
Exhibits and Schedules, set forth the entire understanding of the Parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Any and all previous
agreements and understandings between or among the Parties regarding the
subject matter hereof, whether written or oral, are superseded by this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Disclosure Schedule and all other Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein are intended to be and hereby are specifically made a part of this
Agreement. Matters reflected on the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected therein and the
inclusion of such matters shall not be deemed an admission that such matters
were required to be reflected on the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include

 



      
 

 



 

other matters of a similar nature. The sections of the Disclosure Schedule
have been arranged for purposes of convenience in separately titled sections
corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement; however, each section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all
information disclosed in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule to the
extent it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that the
disclosure of such matter is applicable to such section of the Disclosure
Schedule.

 



 

11.10 _Captions_. All captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

11.11 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable
the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

11.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties agrees that irreparable harm
would occur and that the Parties may not have any adequate remedy at law (a)
for any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (b)
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_, each of the
Seller Parties, the Sellers Representative and Buyers shall be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in
equity, to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement including to consummate the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Shares. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_, the
Seller Parties and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to (i) prevent breaches of this Agreement by any
Buyer, (ii) enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches of, or enforce compliance with the covenants of any Buyer,
including those that require Buyers to consummate the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Shares, if (x) the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_
have been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, _provided_ that each such condition is
then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and remain satisfied or waived
at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for Buyers failure to
fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) the Financing has
been funded or will be funded at the Closing in accordance with its terms; and
(z) the Seller Parties shall have delivered an irrevocable written notice to
US Buyer stating that, if each Buyer performs its obligations hereunder and
the Financing is funded, the Closing will occur, in each case without proof of
actual damages. Any action or proceeding for any such remedy shall be brought
exclusively in such courts as specified in _Section 11.6_ and each Party
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with any such remedy. Each of the Parties agrees that (A) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this _Section 11.12_, a Party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to a Party under this Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that
this Agreement has been breached or terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 11.12_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted and (B) nothing contained in this _Section 11.12_ shall
require any Party to institute any

 



      
 

 



 

Proceeding for (or limit any Partys right to institute any Proceeding for)
specific performance under this _Section 11.12_ before exercising any
termination right under _Section 10.1_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination) nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this
_Section 11.12_ or anything contained in this _Section 11.12_ restrict or
limit any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article X_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that
may be available then or thereafter. The Parties further agree that following
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article X_, the Seller
Parties and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth
in _Section 11.6_ to enforce specifically any Buyers surviving obligations
herein, including to make the payments required under the provisions of
_Article X_.

 



 

11.13 _Interpretation_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any Party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof.

 



 

11.14 _Conflict of Interest_. If any Seller so desires, without the need for
any consent or waiver by the Company, Trillium UK, Trillium Germany or any
Buyer, Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP (" _ML_ ") shall, after the Closing, be
permitted to represent such Seller, any of their agents and Affiliates or any
one or more of them in connection with any dispute (including any litigation,
arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with Buyers, the Company, Trillium
UK, Trillium Germany or any of their agents or Affiliates under or relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Upon and
after the Closing, each of the Company, Trillium UK and Trillium Germany shall
cease to have any attorney-client relationship with ML, unless and to the
extent ML is specifically engaged in writing by such Target Company to
represent such Target Company after the Closing and either such engagement
involves no conflict of interest with respect to any Seller or the Sellers
Representative consents in writing at the time to such engagement.

 



 

11.15 _Sellers  Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment_. Each Seller hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and
appoints US Seller as its agent and true lawful attorney in fact (the "
_Sellers  Representative_"), with full power of substitution, to act in the
name, place and stead of Sellers for purposes of executing any documents and
taking any actions that the Sellers Representative may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection
with such Sellers Representatives duties and obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Authority_. Each Seller hereby grants to the Sellers Representative full
authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of such
Seller (in the name of any or all of Sellers or otherwise) any and all
documents that the Sellers Representative may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and
containing such provisions as the Sellers Representative may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as
contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement
executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby: (i)

 



      
 

 



 

each Buyer, each Buyer Indemnitee and each such partys Representatives shall
be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers Representative on all
matters relating to the Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing Statement and
the determination of the Purchase Price under _Section 2.4_, on all tax
matters under _Section 7.10_, on all matters relating to any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Article IX, on all
matters related to the Escrow Agreement, and all matters related to the Buyer
Termination Fee; and (ii) each Buyer, each Buyer Indemnitee and each such
partys Representatives shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Seller by the Sellers Representative, and on
any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Seller by the
Sellers Representative, as fully binding upon such Seller. The Sellers,
individually and independently, hereby acknowledge and agree that (x) the
Sellers Representative shall be solely responsible for ensuring that each
Seller receives that portion of any amount(s) to which such Seller is entitled
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and which is paid by
Buyers to the Sellers Representative; and (y) Buyers shall bear no obligation
or responsibility to any Seller with regard to the obligations of the Sellers
Representative relating to the pro-rata distribution of such payments or
otherwise.

 



 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. Each Seller recognizes and intends that the power of
attorney granted in this Section 11.15: (i) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Sellers Representative; and (iii)
shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
each of the Sellers.

 



 

(d) _Replacement_. If the Sellers Representative shall dissolve, liquidate or
wind up its affairs, or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities
hereunder, Sellers shall (by consent of Sellers entitled to at least a
majority of the Purchase Price), within 10 days after such dissolution,
liquidation, winding up, or inability, appoint a successor to the Sellers
Representative (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to US Buyer) and
immediately thereafter notify Buyers of the identity of such successor. Any
such successor shall succeed the Sellers Representative as Sellers
Representative hereunder. If for any reason there is no Sellers
Representative at any time, all references herein to the Sellers
Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers.

 



 

11.16 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, each Seller Party (on behalf of itself and the Target
Companies and each of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, controlling persons and agents
(collectively, the " _Seller Related Parties_ ")) acknowledges and irrevocably
agrees: (a) that any Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Financing Source arising out
of, or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter, the
Definitive Financing Agreements or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto, or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or
thereunder, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New
York, and any appellate court thereof, and that each Seller Party submits for
itself and the other Seller Related Parties with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (b) not to bring or
authorize any of their respective Affiliates to bring any such Proceeding in
any other court; (c) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
_Section 11.2_ shall be effective service of process against them for any

 



      
 

 



 

such Proceeding brought in any such court; (d) to waive and hereby waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of
them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such
court; (e) to waive, and hereby waive, any right to trial by jury in respect
of any such Proceeding to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to
_Section 11.6_; (f) that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; (g) that any such
Proceeding shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York that apply to agreements made and performed entirely
within the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law
provisions thereof or of any other jurisdiction; (h) and no Financing Source
will have any Liability to any Seller Related Party, relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Financing, the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or otherwise, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, and none of Seller or any of its Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source hereunder or thereunder; and (i)
that the Financing Sources are beneficiaries of and may enforce any Liability
cap or any limitation on Losses or remedies in this Agreement.
