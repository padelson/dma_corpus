hereto hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Sub

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will

Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of such
conditions) at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn, Chicago,
Illinois 60603; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth

satisfied at the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of
(i) a date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no less than
three (3) Business Days notice to the Company and (ii) the third (3rd)
Business Day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (as

(subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible,
waiver of such conditions) as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso)

hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the
"Closing Date." Immediately prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to
the effecting of the transactions contemplated by _Section 6.01(b)_ ), Parent

immediately following the satisfaction of (x) the condition set forth in
_Section 6.01(b)_ , and subject only to the satisfaction of such condition,

date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as

2  cause the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective

the applicable provisions of the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than
Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
$65.50 in cash, without interest and subject to _Section 2.05_ (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), and all of such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate that formerly
represented any of the Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (in each case, other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than
Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number

 



3  of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction,
or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a
record date within said period, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall be deemed to permit
or authorize the Company to effect any such reclassification, stock split,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment,
other similar transaction, stock dividend or stock distribution that is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to be undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a
U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds
equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the
event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_ (including if any Dissenting Shares
cease to be Dissenting Shares), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to
make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested
by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant
to this _Article II_ ; _provided_ that no investment of such deposited funds
shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from
promptly making the payments required by this _Article II_ , and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, in the
amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held and disbursed in
the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent for
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration. Any interest or income produced
by such investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs.
Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the
benefit of the former holders of Company Common Stock and to make payments
from the Exchange Fund in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to
_Section 2.02(b)_ , except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) _Certificates_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree; and (B)
instructions

 



4  for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, and such other customary documents and instruments as may be
reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ , and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration
may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such payment shall either pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered
or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article II_ (or such other amount paid in respect of Dissenting Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.04_ ). In lieu thereof, each such registered holder of
one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter),
the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share and such Book-Entry Share
shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Share.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 



5 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of their Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
2.02(b)_ , without interest and subject to _Section 2.05_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration properly
delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any portion of the Merger Consideration
that would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent and Parent) of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ ; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Paying Agent or Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of_ _Company Options and Equity Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Companys
board of directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt all
necessary resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan (the "
_Company Options_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be fully vested and cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof and, in exchange therefor, each
holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement
therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option, multiplied by (ii)
the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise
price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option, without interest
(such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) any such Company Option with respect to which the
exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (2)
such Option Payments shall be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time,
no Company Option shall be outstanding or exercisable, and each Company Option
holder shall be entitled only to the payment provided for in this _Section
2.03(a)_.

 



6 (b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Companys board of directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall
adopt all necessary resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units (" _RSUs_ ") with respect
to Shares granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (each, an " _RSU Award_ ")
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) shall be fully
vested, (ii) any performance conditions applicable to such RSU Award shall
be deemed satisfied in full and (iii) shall be cancelled by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof and, in
exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award
and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the
product of (A) the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award, multiplied by (B)
the Merger Consideration, without interest (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_ ).

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and, except as provided in this _Section

Awards shall be granted or remain outstanding or in effect thereunder, and
the Company shall have taken all actions necessary to ensure that, from and

after the Effective Time, or at such later time as necessary to avoid a
violation and/or adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.

Section 2.04  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the

the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of their Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ , but shall be
converted into the right to receive fair value of such Share as

 



7  determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to
perfect or otherwise loses or waives its right of appraisal, in any case
pursuant to the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
such Share, without interest and subject to _Section 2.05_. The Company shall
give Parent prompt written notice of any demands or written threats for
appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands or
threats and any other documents received by the Company in respect thereof
(including instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL), and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, threats or
documents. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands or threats or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.05 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Payroll Agent and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of the
Shares, Company Options and RSU Awards cancelled in the Merger such Tax
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, any regulation promulgated thereunder by the
United States Department of Treasury (a " _Treasury Regulation_ ") or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
Tax amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld Tax amounts (a) shall be
remitted by the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Payroll Agent or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares, Company Options or RSU Awards in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

Section 3.13 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list as of the date hereof of each material Company Benefit Plan,
which for the avoidance of doubt excludes any employment contracts or
consultancy agreements for employees or consultants who are natural persons
that are pursuant to a standard form previously made available to Parent where
the base compensation provided under such employment or consultancy agreement
is less than $200,000 per annum. With respect to each such Company Benefit
Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of, as
applicable: (i) each such Company Benefit Plan that has been reduced to
writing and all amendments thereto; (ii) each trust, insurance or
administrative agreement relating to each such Company Benefit Plan; (iii) the
most recent summary plan description or other written explanation of each
Company Benefit Plan provided to participants; (iv) the most recent annual
reports (Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "); (v)
the most recent determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by the IRS
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code; and (vi) the most recent actuarial report with
respect to any such Company Benefit Plan.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each U.S. Company Benefit
Plan has been established, operated and administered in compliance with its

contributions required to be made to any U.S. Company Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document or other Contract, and all premiums
due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any U.S. Company
Benefit Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been reflected
on the books and records of the Company in accordance with GAAP. There are no
material Proceedings (other than for routine claims for benefits) pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or with respect to any
U.S. Company Benefit Plan or the assets of any U.S. Company Benefit Plans and,
to the knowledge of the Company, with respect to any fiduciary of any U.S.
Company Benefit Plan whom the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
an obligation to indemnify, there are no material Proceedings pending or
threatened in respect of any such fiduciarys duties to the U.S. Company
Benefit Plan. Each U.S. Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified status or has timely
filed an application for a favorable determination letter, or may rely upon an
opinion letter for a prototype or volume submitter plan, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no circumstances have occurred that could reasonably
be expected to result in disqualification of any such plan or related trust.

their respective ERISA Affiliates maintained, contributed to or had any
obligations or liabilities under, any employee benefit subject to Section 302
or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, any multiemployer pension
plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or
any plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 3.13(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, will not, either alone or in combination with

(as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that could reasonably be expected to, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any Contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of Taxes imposed
by Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not

Financing Source has committed, subject only to the terms thereof, to invest
the amounts set forth therein on the date on which the Closing should occur
pursuant to _Section 1.02_ and to which the Company is an express third party
beneficiary in accordance with the terms thereof and subject to

National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, Royal Bank of Canada RBC Capital
Markets, UBS AG, Stamford Branch and UBS Securities LLC, pursuant to which
certain of the Debt Financing Sources (the Debt Financing Sources, together
with the Equity Financing Sources, the " _Financing Sources_ ") have
committed, subject only to the terms thereof, to lend the amounts set forth
therein for purposes of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section
1.02_ (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the "
_Financing_ "). Parent has also delivered to the Company true and complete
copies of any fee letter (with only the fee amounts, pricing caps and certain
other economic terms (none of which individually or in the aggregate would
reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or adversely affect the availability
or conditionality of the Debt Financing or delay or prevent the Closing or
make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur) redacted)
relating to the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee letter, a " _Fee Letter_
") and any engagement letters or other agreements relating to the Debt
Financing.

(b) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_
and _Section 6.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing), the aggregate net proceeds from the Financing when
funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments (together with the
available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of Parent and
Parents Subsidiaries and the purchase price received by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the Bank Purchase Agreement on the Closing
Date) are sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by
Parent or Sub for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and are sufficient for the satisfaction when due of all of the
obligations of Parent and Sub under this Agreement (including the payment of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
2.03_ , the payment of all costs and expenses of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any obligations of the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries) which become due or payable by the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary in connection with, or as a result of,
the Merger and any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness required in
connection therewith or contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments) on
the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ ").

 

(c) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise
amended,

 



32  supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments,
in the form delivered to the Company, is, as of the date hereof, a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the knowledge of
Parent, such other parties in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, there are no side
letters or other Contracts or arrangements (except for any Fee Letters,
engagement letters with respect to the Debt Financing and any other
agreements, each of which have been delivered to the Company in accordance
with the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _4.07(a)_ ) relating to the Financing
Commitments. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent under any term, or a failure by Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto to satisfy any condition, of the
Financing Commitments. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.01_ and  _Section 6.02_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), neither Parent nor Sub has
reason to believe that it, any Equity Financing Source or any Debt Financing
Source would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
the Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it. Parent and Sub have
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies between Parent or Sub, on the one
hand, and any Financing Source, on the other hand, related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.

Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) are Solvent as of the date hereof, (b) the
Company has performed and complied with its covenants and agreements set forth
herein, (c) the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Sub to consummate
the Merger have been satisfied or waived and (d) the most recent financial
statements included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material
respects the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the
consolidated results of operations of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby, then at and immediately
following the Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the funding of the
Financing and the Financing Uses, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, will be Solvent. Parent and Sub are
not entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Parent, Sub, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any affiliates thereof.

Section 4.09 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker other than
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee
or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Sub or any of
their respective affiliates.

Section 4.10 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. Other than this Agreement, the
Voting Agreements and as set forth on _Section 4.10_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, as of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or any commitments to
enter into any Contract between Parent, Sub or any of their respective
controlled affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer,

 



33  employee or stockholder of the Company, on the other hand, (a) relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time or (b) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or
approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any Competing Proposal.

Section 4.11 _Acknowledgement of No Other Representations or Warranties_.

investigation and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of

have received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment,
Contracts and other assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that it
and its representatives have desired or requested to review for such purpose
and that it and its representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the
management of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to discuss the

the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ , none of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or the
Company Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty,
either express or implied, concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) From and after the date hereof, until the earlier of the Effective Time

Representatives to, immediately cease and use reasonable best efforts to cause
to be terminated any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
persons that may be ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal and,
unless the Company has previously made such a request and the person to whom

38 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time following the execution and delivery hereof by the Company and
prior to the Company obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the
Company has received a written Competing Proposal (it being agreed that the
Company and the Companys board of directors may correspond in writing with
(or ask questions of) any person making such a written Competing Proposal and
its representatives solely to request clarification of the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Competing Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , that the Company complies with its notice obligations to Parent
with respect to such Competing Proposal (including notice of such
further correspondence or discussions) in accordance with the immediately
subsequent sentence) from a person that did not result from a breach of
_Section 5.03(a)_ , which Competing Proposal was made on or after the date
hereof and (ii) the Companys board of directors (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to take the
actions described in the subsequent clauses (A) or (B) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board
of directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then
the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing Proposal and its
representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding
such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not,
and will cause the Company Subsidiaries and will use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Representatives not to, disclose any non-public
information regarding the Company to such person without the Company first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person. The
Company will promptly (and in any event within 36 hours) advise Parent of the
receipt of any Competing Proposal, which notice will include, unless the
Company is prohibited from doing so pursuant to a Contract in effect as of the
date hereof ( _provided_ , if such a prohibition exists, the Company shall
advise Parent of the subject matter of any such information that cannot be
disclosed and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional specific
procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure
compliance with applicable Laws), the identity of the person or persons making
such Competing Proposal, an unredacted copy of such Competing Proposal if made
in writing (or a written summary of the material terms of such Competing
Proposal if not made in writing), any relevant proposed transaction
agreements, a copy of any financing commitments (including redacted fee
letters), and, substantially concurrently with the delivery thereof to the
person (or its representatives) making the Competing Proposal, any information
concerning the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their businesses, assets
or properties provided or made available to such other person (or its
representatives) by the Company after receipt by the Company of the Competing
Proposal that was not previously provided or made available to Parent (such
information and documentation, the " _Competing Proposal Information_ ").
Following the date hereof, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a prompt basis of any material change in the terms and conditions of any
such Competing Proposal, and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall enter into any Contract that would prohibit them from providing the
Competing Proposal Information to Parent or its representatives.

 



39 (c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ or _Section 5.03(e)_ , neither
the Companys board of directors nor any committee thereof shall, (i) adopt,
authorize or approve or recommend any Competing Proposal (or publicly propose
to recommend any Competing Proposal), (ii) withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify
or amend, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (or
publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions), (iii) if a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that
constitutes a Competing Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the
Company (including for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to
the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of
the Company, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance
of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten Business Days after
commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act _(provided_
, that, for the avoidance of doubt, a statement that the Companys board of
directors recommends against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer but,
in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _5.03_ , is engaging in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such tender or exchange offer, shall
not be deemed to be a Change of Company Recommendation) (any action set forth
in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , a " _Change of
Company Recommendation_ "), (iv) allow or authorize the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding to effect any
Competing Proposal with the person that made such Competing Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (v) make the provisions of any antitakeover or similar statute
or regulation inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Competing
Proposal, (vi) terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to use
reasonable best efforts to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission,
waiver or request under, any standstill agreement entered into by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing
Proposal (provided, that, to the extent the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel that
failure to provide a limited waiver to any such standstill agreement solely to
permit the counterparty thereto privately to approach the Companys board of
directors regarding a Competing Proposal would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the Company may provide such
limited waiver) or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Companys
board of directors (or any committee thereof) may make a Change of Company
Recommendation (and, if so desired by the Companys board of directors (or
any committee thereof), terminate this Agreement in order to cause the Company
to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal) if
and only if:

 

(i) (A) a written Competing Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
_Section 5.03(a)_ ) is made to the Company by a third person and (B) the
Companys board of directors (or any committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

 



40 (ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Companys
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement in order to cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to the Competing Proposal at least five (5) days prior to making
such Change of Company Recommendation or terminating this Agreement (such
time period, the " _Match Period_ " and such notice, a " _Notice of Change of
Recommendation_ "), which notice shall identify the person making such
Superior Proposal and include an unredacted draft of the definitive agreement
to effect such Superior Proposal and any financing documents (which may be
redacted in a customary manner) relating thereto (it being agreed that neither
(x) the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company nor
(y) the public announcement that the Companys board of directors (or any
committee thereof) has received a Competing Proposal, is evaluating such
Competing Proposal and has delivered such notice shall constitute a Change of
Company Recommendation unless and until the Company shall have failed within
24 hours after the end of the Match Period (after giving effect to the proviso
in _Section_ _ _ _5.03(d)(iv)_ ) to publicly announce that it (A) is
recommending the Merger and (B) has determined that such Competing Proposal
(taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to this
Agreement agreed to by the Parent in writing and (y) any modifications or
adjustments made to such Competing Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal and
has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal);

 

(iii) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated in good faith, and
directed any applicable Company Representatives to negotiate in good faith,
with Parent for at least five (5) days following receipt by Parent of such
Notice of Change of Recommendation with respect to any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in a written offer; and

 

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to
by Parent in a written offer to the Company pursuant to  _clause (iii)_
above, the Companys board of directors (or any committee thereof) has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes agreed to in
writing by Parent were to be given effect; _provided_ , that any amendment to
the amount or form of consideration contemplated by such Competing Proposal or
any other material amendment to the terms of such Competing Proposal (whether
or not in response to any changes proposed by Parent pursuant to _clause
(iii)_ above) shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an
additional three (3)-day period from the date of such notice during which the
terms of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ above and this _clause (iv)_ shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 5.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this  _Section 5.03(e)_ ),
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Companys board of
directors (or any committee thereof) from withholding, modifying or amending,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation if there is an
Intervening Event, as a result of which, the Companys board of directors (or
any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of
the Companys board

 



41  of directors (or any committee thereof) to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys
board of directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that:

(i) the Company shall give Parent at least five (5) days advance
written notice of its intention to take such action (such time period, the "
_Intervening Event Period_ " and such notice, an " _Intervening Event Notice_
"), which notice shall include a reasonably detailed summary of the
relevant Intervening Event (it being agreed that neither the delivery of the
Intervening Event Notice nor the public announcement that the Company has
delivered an Intervening Event Notice shall constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation unless and until the Company shall have failed within 24 hours
after the end of the Intervening Event Period to publicly announce that it is
recommending the Merger);

 

(ii) the Company shall give Parent at least five (5) days following receipt by
Parent of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement (or
make another proposal) and shall, and shall have directed the applicable
Company Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect
to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, during such five
(5)-day period; and

(iii) following the end of such five (5)-day period, the Companys board of
directors (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in a
written offer to the Company pursuant to _clause (ii)_ above and in
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that the failure of the Companys board of directors (or any committee
thereof) to effect a Change of Company Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board
of directors to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit the Companys
board of directors (or any committee thereof) from (i) disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Companys
board of directors (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Companys board of directors to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the
issuance by the Company or the Companys board of directors (or any committee
thereof) of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure under the foregoing clause (i)
shall be deemed a Change of Company Recommendation unless it includes either
an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that the board of directors of the Company may not make a Change
of Company Recommendation unless permitted to do so by  _Section 5.03(d)_ or
_Section 5.03(e)_.

(g) If any Competing Proposal is made as a result of any action by a
Company Representative that would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.03_
had the Company taken such action, such Competing Proposal shall, solely for
purposes of _Section 5.03(b)_ , _Section 5.03(c)_, _Section 5.03(d)_ , 
_Section 7.01(e)_ and the definition of "Superior Proposal", be deemed to have
resulted from a breach of this _Section 5.03_.

 



42 Section 5.04 _Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement
with the SEC. Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.03_ , the Proxy Statement shall
include the Company Recommendation. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all information
concerning it, Sub, the Equity Financing Sources and any of their respective
affiliates that is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to filing
or mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or written response and shall consider in
good faith any comments on such document or response reasonably proposed by
Parent. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments (written or oral) to the Proxy Statement from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement to modify any information
solely relating to Parent, Sub, the Equity Financing Sources and any of their
respective affiliates shall be made without the prior written approval of
Parent unless required by applicable Law (and then only after Parent has been
provided an opportunity to review and comment on such amendment or supplement
and the Company has considered in good faith any comments on such amendment
or supplement reasonably proposed by Parent).

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, the Equity Financing Sources or any of
their respective affiliates is discovered by the Company or Parent that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
as promptly as practicable notify the other party. Following such
notification, the Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information as promptly as reasonably
practicable after Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, and, to the extent the Company determines it is required by
applicable Law, the Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to
the stockholders of the Company.

 



43 (c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders in
accordance with _Section 5.04(a)_ (and in any event no more than forty-five
(45) days after such clearance), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of voting on (i) the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger, (ii) a non-binding advisory proposal to approve change-in-control
payments to executives of the Company, and (iii) a proposal to adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the Agreement.
Except as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not submit any other
proposal to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent. The record date and meeting date of the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall be selected by the Company after reasonable
consultation with Parent. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company may, in its reasonable discretion, adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting after consultation with Parent only (A) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement that the Company has determined in good faith after consultation
with its legal counsel is required under applicable Law is provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, (B) if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) or is scheduled to reconvene following an adjournment thereof,
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time
the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting or (C) the
Company determines the failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable
Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that unless and only for so long as the
Company is in a Match Period, the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be
adjourned for more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate from the
originally scheduled date of the Company Stockholder Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise
Parent on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7) days prior to the date
of the Company Stockholder Meeting (and any reconvening thereof) as to the
aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company
Stockholder Approval and whether such proxies have been voted
affirmatively or negatively with respect to each of the proposals to be
presented at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to _Section 5.03_ , the
Companys board of directors shall recommend that the Companys stockholders
adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), and the Company
shall, unless there has been a Change of Company Recommendation permitted by
this Agreement, or this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be permitted to call and
hold its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders so long as the matters to be
voted upon at such meeting do not include the consideration of any Competing
Proposal and would not otherwise constitute a breach of _Section 5.03_.

Section 5.05 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to: (a) provide to Parent

 



44  and Sub and their respective representatives, and to the Debt Financing
Sources, reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as
not to interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the
officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (b)
furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as
Parent or its representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company
Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent
that the Company believes in good faith that doing so would: (i) result in the
loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner
that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any
confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party; (iii) result
in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving

violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law);
_provided_ , _further_ , if any of the restrictions in the foregoing clauses

45 Section 5.06 _Rea_ _sonable Best Efforts; Cooperation; Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.03_ , (1) each of Parent and the Company shall (and
shall cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied, (2) the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Bank Purchase Agreement
and the conditions set forth in the Bank Purchase Agreement to be satisfied
(and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in
connection therewith). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of its affiliates to) and the
Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to) use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all actions or nonactions,
consents (including Required Consents), Permits (including Environmental
Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from Governmental
Entities or other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date hereof, make and not withdraw (without the other
partys consent) all registrations and filings with any Governmental Entity
or other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the filings required of the
parties hereto or their "ultimate parent entities" or "ultimate controlling
persons" under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and any Banking Laws,
and promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary
or advisable, (iii) other than with respect to any proceeding under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law (which is addressed by _Section 5.06(c)_ ), or
under any Banking Law or by or before any Banking Regulator (which is
addressed by _Section 5.06(b)_ ), (A) defend all lawsuits or other legal,
regulatory, administrative or other proceedings to which it or any of its
affiliates is a party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
until the issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect to each such
lawsuit or proceeding, (B) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order which may adversely affect the ability of the parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case until the
issuance of a final, non-appealable order with respect thereto and (C) seek to
resolve any objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) execute and
deliver any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Neither Parent nor Sub, directly
or indirectly, through one or more of their respective affiliates, shall take
any action, including acquiring or making any investment in any person or any
division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause a
material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article
VI_ or the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Subject to _Sections 5.06(d)_ and _5.06(e)_ , the Company shall (and
shall cause each of its affiliates to) promptly make all filings required by
the Banking Regulators or Banking Laws in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby or the Bank Purchase Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby. In furtherance of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.06(b)_ and notwithstanding any limitations herein or
elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) Parent and the Company shall, in consultation
with the other and otherwise subject to Parents consent right under this
_Section 5.06(b)_ , use reasonable best efforts to (and to cause each of its
affiliates to) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the
consummation of the Banking Business Transaction and (ii) the Company shall,
in consultation with Parent and otherwise subject to Parents consent right
under this _Section _ _5.06(b)_ ,

 



46  use reasonable best efforts to (and to cause each of its affiliates to)
obtain all approvals and consents under any Banking Laws that may be required
by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each
case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate
the Banking Business Transaction as promptly as practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its
affiliates to), without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any
undertaking or commitment pursuant to this _Section 5.06(b)_ or otherwise
in connection with obtaining any required approvals or consents under any
Banking Laws for the Banking Business Transaction, if, in each case, the
taking of such action would result in Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective affiliates incurring any continuing liability or
obligation after the Closing that would be material to the Parent and its
affiliates, taken as a whole, following completion of the Merger, and (y) the
Company shall not be required to make any undertaking, commitment or
concession that is not conditioned upon the Closing occurring.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Parent and the Companys undertaking
pursuant to _Section 5.06(a)_ , and notwithstanding any limitations therein or
elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its respective affiliates to, use its and their
reasonable best efforts to take as promptly as possible any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or
competition Governmental Entity or any other person so as to enable the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated as promptly as possible,
including with respect to (but not limited to) complying with or modifying any
requests for additional information by any Governmental Entity as soon as
possible (including prior to issuance of a "second request") and using
reasonable best efforts to prepare presentations and materials for submission
to any such Governmental Entity (including prior to issuance of a "second
request"). In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, prior
to the Outside Date, defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any person in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any order that would prevent or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including contesting, defending,
resisting or appealing any action or other proceeding until a final, non-
appealable order is entered unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated
in accordance with its terms. If the parties receive a "second request", each
of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to certify compliance with
such "second request" as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
three months after receipt thereof) and to produce documents on a rolling
basis, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety
of any such "second request" review process. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall be obligated
to consent to any divestiture or other structural or conduct relief in order
to obtain clearance from any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the
generality of anything contained in this _Section 5.06_ , each party hereto
shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement
of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or
before any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and
(iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from any
Banking Regulator, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger or the Banking Business Transaction,
as applicable. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other
parties and will consider

 



47  in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Banking Business Transaction.
In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized representatives of
the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.06_ , no party
hereto shall be in violation of this Agreement by virtue of providing
information that is competitively sensitive to one another on an "outside
counsel only" or other basis designed to ensure compliance with applicable
Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law).

(d) The Company (i) shall use reasonable best efforts to comply in all
material respects with all of its covenants and agreements set forth in the
Bank Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof (including any covenants and agreements related to
obtaining (or providing the other parties with assistance and cooperation in
its efforts to obtain) any consents or approvals required in order to
consummate the Banking Business Transaction), and (ii) shall not (and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries not to) agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant or obtain any waivers or consents of, any condition
or other provision under the Bank Purchase Agreement that would adversely
affect Parent in any material respect, in each case, without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In furtherance of the obligations set forth in
_Section 5.06(a)_ , the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Banking Business Transaction on the terms and conditions
described in the Bank Purchase Agreement including (A) using its reasonable
best efforts to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent to the
Banking Business Transaction as set forth in the Bank Purchase Agreement and
(B) at the request of Parent, fully enforcing its rights (and the
counterpartys obligations) under the Bank Purchase Agreement. The Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, keep Parent informed
on a reasonably prompt basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Banking Business Transaction. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall (1) furnish Parent with any
proposed draft amendments to the Bank Purchase Agreement and complete, correct
and executed copies of any amendments to the Bank Purchase Agreement promptly
upon execution thereof and (2) give Parent prompt written notice (w) of any
default or material breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would (or would reasonably be expected to) give rise to any
default or material breach) by any party under the Bank Purchase Agreement
of which the Company becomes aware, (x) of any termination of the Bank
Purchase Agreement, (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other
communication from any person with respect to any (1) default, material
breach, termination or repudiation of the Bank Purchase Agreement by any
party thereto, or (2) receipt of any regulatory approvals required under
Banking Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Bank Purchase
Agreement, and (z) if for any reason the Company believes in good faith that
it will not be able to consummate the Banking Business Transaction on the
terms or in the manner contemplated by the Bank Purchase Agreement, including,
without limitation, any actual or potential failure or delay in obtaining
any 

 



48  required regulatory approvals, or otherwise in satisfying any other
conditions necessary, in each case, to consummate the Banking Business
Transaction on the terms set forth in the Bank Purchase Agreement. Promptly
following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Bank Purchase
Agreement, the Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to)
take all actions reasonably necessary to (i) surrender any Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation deposit insurance of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and (ii) receive confirmation of such surrender from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

 

(e) In addition to its other obligations under this _Section 5.06,_ prior to
the Closing, Parent shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its affiliates and the Equity Financing Sources to, provide to the Company all
reasonable cooperation requested by the Company with respect to the (i) the
Companys performance of its obligations under the Bank Purchase Agreement,
(ii) the establishment of the Program (as defined in the Bank Purchase
Agreement) and (iii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Bank Purchase Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates not to enter into any
agreements with any party to the Bank Purchase Agreement or any of such
persons affiliates relating to this Agreement, the Bank Purchase Agreement or
any of the transactions or matters contemplated hereby or thereby without the
prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that no prior written consent
of the Company is required for Parent to enter into any such agreement to the
extent that such agreement do not take effect until after the Closing Date or
otherwise only relates to matters that arise from and after the Closing Date.
Parent shall permit the Company to be reasonably involved in meetings and
substantive scheduled discussions with the counterparty to the Bank Purchase
Agreement or any of its affiliates relating to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Bank Purchase Agreement or
any partys obligations prior to Closing under this Agreement or the Bank
Purchase Agreement, provided, that Parent shall not be required to include the
Company in any portions of such meetings or discussions during which
competitively sensitive information of Parent or any of its affiliates is
being discussed.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, and without
limiting in any respect Parents obligations to use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Banking Business Transaction pursuant to this _Section 5.06_ ,
in the event the Bank Purchase Agreement is terminated, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange for the Company an
alternative transaction for the sale of the Banking Business (an "
_Alternative Banking Business Transaction_ "), in the most expeditious manner
practicable (and, in any event, prior to the date that is five (5) Business
Days before the Outside Date), pursuant to a transaction with another third
party and on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company and pursuant to a
replacement Bank Purchase Agreement (such alternative transaction arranged by
Parent for the Company or any alternative transaction arranged by the
Company, the " _Alternative Bank Purchase Agreement_ "); provided that the
Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any
Alternative Banking Business Transaction on terms or conditions (i) that are
materially less favorable to the Company (or from and after the Effective
Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) than the Banking
Business Transaction contemplated by the Bank Purchase Agreement delivered to
Parent as of the date hereof (including with

 



49  respect to (A) the Tax treatment of such transaction, (B) the retained
liabilities of the Company from and after the consummation of any such
transaction and (C) the credit card program agreement with the bank purchaser
party to the Bank Purchase Agreement) or (ii) that would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the timely satisfaction of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VI_. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Representatives to, permit Parent and its representatives to be
involved in discussions, negotiations, communications or other actions
regarding such Alternative Banking Business Transaction and related credit
card program agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall furnish Parent complete copies of all material drafts of any
Alternative Bank Purchase Agreement and related credit card program agreement
in connection with the negotiations thereof (in addition to the executed copy
of such Alternative Bank Purchase Agreement and related credit card program
agreement promptly upon the execution thereof) and shall keep Parent
reasonably and promptly informed as to the status and material terms of any
negotiations in connection therewith. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver the Alternative Bank Purchase
Agreement (subject to Parents consent rights under this  _Section 5.06(f)_
).

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.06_ shall be deemed to prohibit or limit the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries ability to take the actions
contemplated by _Section 5.03_.

Section 5.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts and do all things
necessary or advisable to obtain the Financing as soon as reasonably
practicable and, in any event, not later than the date the Closing is required
to be effected in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _1.02_ , on the terms and
conditions (including, to the extent applicable, the "flex" provisions)
described in the Financing Commitments (for purposes of this _Section 5.07_ ,
the Financing Commitments and the Debt Commitment Letter shall include any Fee
Letter), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (as
such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter, and within the limits of the "flex" provisions
contained in any Fee Letter) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or on
such other terms acceptable to Parent and the applicable Debt Financing
Sources so long as such other terms would not (x) delay or prevent the
Closing, (y) adversely impact or delay in any respect the likelihood of the
funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining any of the Financing) or (z) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements (in each case, in accordance with their terms) or
the ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "), (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all terms, conditions and covenants, including with
respect to the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees,
applicable to Parent or Sub in the Financing Commitments and the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements that are in Parents and Subs control to satisfy,
(iii) consummate (and cause the Financing Sources to consummate) the
Financing at or prior to Closing and (iv) enforce their rights under the
Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Prior to
the Closing, Parent and Sub shall not agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Financing Commitments or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements
without the prior written consent of the Company (which

 



50  consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided
that, without the Companys consent, Parent and Sub may (1) agree to any
amendments, restatements, modifications or waivers to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if such amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver would not (and would not be reasonably
expected to) (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fee) unless, in the case of
any reduction in the amount of the Debt Financing, the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount (and vice versa), (B) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise expand or adversely amend any conditions,
to the receipt of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing, (C) delay or prevent
the Closing, (D) adversely impact the likelihood of the funding of the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining any of the Financing) or (E) adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements or the ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E),
collectively, the " _Prohibited Financing Amendments_ "); and (2) amend,
restate, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to add lenders, lead arrangers, book
runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (but not make any other
changes), but only if the addition of such additional parties, individually or
in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a Prohibited
Financing Amendment. Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect the Financing Commitments (including any Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements) until the Closing occurs ( _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not limit Parents or Subs right to amend, restate, modify or
waive the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence). Prior to
Closing, neither Parent nor Sub shall release or consent to the termination of
the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements without the prior written consent
of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall have the
right to (i) reduce the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter by an
amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds from
consummated offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) of Parent
and/or its Subsidiaries consummated after the date hereof for which such
proceeds have been received by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries after the date
hereof and are not subject to any conditions or contingencies to financing
(including conditions to any escrow agreement) that are not contained in, or
are more expansive or less favorable to Parent than those contained in, the
Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) substitute such proceeds for the amount by
which the commitments under the Commitment Letter are reduced; _provided_
that: (A) an amount in cash or cash equivalents equal to such substituted
proceeds is retained by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries and such amount has
been identified by Parent for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and there are no conditions or restrictions on
Parents ability to use such amount to fund the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any restriction as to which a Subsidiary of Parent
is subject, to the extent such restriction prohibits such Subsidiary from
transferring, directly or indirectly, such amount to Parent); (B) such
substituted proceeds shall be in an amount sufficient, together with the
Equity Financing and any remaining Debt Financing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated

 



51  hereby; and (C) to the extent any of such proceeds are from consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) that have scheduled
redemptions or mandatory redemptions or put rights (other than customary
change of control redemption or put rights), such scheduled redemption is not
scheduled to occur prior to, and such right is not exercisable prior to, a
date that is earlier than the Outside Date. Further, Parent shall have the
right to substitute commitments in respect of other financing for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third
party financing sources reasonably acceptable to the Company (which will be
in an amount sufficient to fund, when taken together with the Equity Financing
and the other resources of Parent and other financing arrangements, the
Financing Uses), so long as (1) all conditions precedent and contingencies to
funding of such financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of
funding, equivalent to (or more favorable to Parent than) the conditions
precedent and contingencies set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, to
replace the Debt Financing and (2) such substitution does not (x) delay or
prevent the Closing, (y) adversely impact the likelihood of the funding of the
Debt Financing or the Equity Financing or (z) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements (in each case, in accordance with their terms) or the
ability of Parent or Sub to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (" _Alternative Financing_ "). If the Debt Commitment
Letter (or any Definitive Debt Financing Agreement) expires or is terminated
or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately preceding the Outside Date,
arrange for and obtain debt financing from alternative sources so long as such
alternative financing would constitute an Alternative Financing. The new debt
commitment letter and fee letter entered into in connection with any
Alternative Financing are referred to, respectively, as a " _New Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and a " _New Fee Letter_." In the event Parent or Sub
enter into any such New Debt Commitment Letter (or any amendment,
restatement, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms of _Section 5.07(a)_ ), (a) Parent and Sub shall
promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies thereof,
(b) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall mean the
debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as so modified or by
such New Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, and (c) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any definition incorporating
the term "Debt Commitment Letter," including the definition of Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements) shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter
and any Fee Letter as so modified to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter, as the case may be, at the time in
question and any New Debt Commitment Letter or New Fee Letter to the
extent then in effect.

(c) Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their representatives to, keep the
Company informed as promptly as practicable in reasonable detail of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and, subject to
applicable confidentiality restrictions (which shall be no more restrictive
than the Debt Commitment Letter delivered to the Company prior to the Closing
Date), substantially concurrently with their execution provide copies of all
definitive agreements entered into with respect to the Debt Financing to the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
(i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any
amendments to the Financing Commitments promptly upon their execution and (ii)
give the

 



52  Company prompt written notice (A) of any default or breach (or any event
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (or would
reasonably be expected to) give rise to any default or breach) by any party
under any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing of which Parent or Sub becomes aware, if such breach or
default would reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability of, or
the amount of, the Financing, (B) of any termination of either of the
Financing Commitments, and (C) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any person with respect to any (1) actual or
potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of any Financing
Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing or any
provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (2) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, in the case of each of
clauses (1) and (2), that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, the Financing.

(d) Prior to the Closing, at Parents sole expense, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and instruct the Company Representatives
to, in each case, use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
Parent and Sub all customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that
is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Debt Financing or
any Alternative Financing, including using commercially reasonable efforts (i)
to cause management of the Company to participate in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, sessions with rating agencies and due diligence
sessions, in each case, with appropriate seniority and expertise, (ii) to
cooperate with marketing efforts for the Debt Financing, including (A)
assisting the Debt Financing Sources in benefitting from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (B) providing
reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda (including one or
more confidential information memoranda) and other offering and marketing
materials, (C) delivering customary authorization letters and confirmations
(including with respect to presence or absence of material non-public
information and accuracy of the information contained therein), (D) providing
reasonable cooperation with the Debt Financing sources on their due diligence
efforts and the consummation of the Debt Financing to the extent reasonable
and customary and (E) updating information provided in writing by Parent
describing the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with
normal customary practice in connection with the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter such that, after giving effect to such updates,
such information, when taken as a whole, will be correct in all material
respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which
such statements are made (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the
limitations contained in _Section 5.05_ hereof), (iii) to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent and required under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(A) obtaining documents reasonably requested by Parent or its Debt Financing
Sources relating to the repayment of the existing indebtedness of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and the release of related liens and other
security interests, including customary payoff letters and termination
documents and (B) within three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
providing all documentation and other information required by bank
regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to
the Company or any of the Company

 



53  Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (iv) furnishing Parent and Sub
and the Financing Sources with (A) historic financial information required by
paragraph 4 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date hereof, (B) such historic financial information related to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably required by Parent for Parent
to produce the pro forma financial statements identified in paragraph 5 of
Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and specified in
writing by Parent to the Company and (C) such other customary financial data
or other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing no later than
20 Business Days after the date hereof and that is reasonably necessary to
consummate the Debt Financing (clauses (A), (B) and (C) together, the "
_Required Information_ "), provided that the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to prepare or provide any projections or
information in connection with the potential purchase price accounting
treatment of the Merger, provided that none of the following shall be
considered the Required Information and the Company shall have no obligation
to provide any such information: (1) any post-Closing or pro forma
cost savings, capitalization and other post-Closing or (and the assumptions
relating thereto) desired by the Parent to be reflected in such pro forma
data, (2) any projections or any information in connection with the potential
purchase price accounting treatment of the Merger, (3) in the case of _clause
(C)_ of the definition of Required Information, any other information
concerning the assumptions underlying the post-Closing or pro forma
adjustments to be made in such pro forma adjustments or (4) in the case of
_clause (C)_ of the definition of Required Information, any adjustments to any
pro forma financial information required to be provided in accordance with the
Debt Commitment Letter, (v) cooperate to facilitate the pledging of, granting
of security interests in and obtaining perfection of any liens on, collateral
in connection with the Debt Financing and to deliver original stock
certificates, if any, together with customary stock powers executed in
blank, with respect to the Company and the material, wholly owned U.S.
Company Subsidiaries that are required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be
delivered in order to perfect the security interests of the lenders in such
collateral and (vi) take all actions reasonably requested by Parent and
necessary to permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing to
evaluate the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries inventory, current assets
and cash management systems for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements (including sufficient access to allow the Debt Financing Sources
to complete field exams and conducting the commercial finance examination and
inventory appraisals contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter within the
time frame described therein) (and, to the extent applicable, subject to the
limitations contained in _Section 5.05_ hereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(1) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would (A)
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Company Charter or Company Bylaws
or other comparable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, any
Applicable Laws or any Contract, (2) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any action that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the
Effective Time, (3) neither the Companys board of directors nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall be
required to approve or adopt any Financing or agreements related thereto (or
any Alternative Financing), (4) neither the Company 

 



54  nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to execute or deliver
any agreements, certificates or instruments in connection with any Financing
(or any Alternative Financing), provided that Parent shall be permitted to
request that employees of the Company who have been significantly involved in
the negotiation of the Debt Financing and will continue to be employees
following Closing execute such agreements, certificates or instruments and
(5) in no event shall the Company be in breach of this Agreement because of
the failure of any financial or other information to be delivered that is not
available to the Company at the time requested by Parent. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or
otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other than for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by Parent as
provided below in this _Section 5.07(d)_) or incur any other liability or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or
any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Financing (including any
action taken in accordance with this _Section 5.07(d)_ ) and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information provided
in writing by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Representatives specifically for use in connection therewith). Nothing
contained in this _Section 5.07(d)_ or otherwise shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.

 

(e) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining
of the Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in _Section
6.02(b)_ , as it applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section
5.07_ , shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained
primarily as a result of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys willful and
material breach of its obligations under this _Section 5.07_ with respect to
the Financing.

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations contained in this _Section
5.07_ shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing.

 

Section 5.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release, the contents of which have
received prior approval from both such parties, and thereafter Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the other partys prior written
consent;  _provided_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.08_ shall not apply to any press release, public statement or other
announcement issued or made, or proposed to be issued or made, (a) by the
Company in connection with a Competing Proposal or

 



55  Change of Company Recommendation or (b) as may be required by applicable
Law, the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, which, in the
case of clause (b), the party making such release, statement or other
announcement shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other party to the extent practicable and permissible under applicable Law.

Section 5.09 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th)
anniversary thereof, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the Companys or the applicable
Company Subsidiarys organizational documents, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims,
damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or
arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
fiduciary under benefit plans prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are
based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such persons rights
under this _Section_ _ _ _5.09_. In the event of any such loss, expense,
claim, damage or liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective
Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor
are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request,
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

 

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for a "tail" insurance and
indemnification policy for a claims reporting period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event
not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than
the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor Parent shall purchase
such a "tail" policy for a premium amount for any one year in excess of 300%
of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full
fiscal year for such insurance (the " _Tail Cap_ "). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for so
long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six (6) year
period thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance

 



56  in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six (6) year period (and for so long thereafter as any
claims brought before the end of such six (6) year period thereunder are
being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for
such DandO Insurance to the extent exceeding 300% of the annual premium paid by
the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance and
if the premiums of such insurance coverage with respect to any policy year
exceed the Tail Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Tail Cap.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 5.09_.

(d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the
amended and restated bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar documents) of each Company
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary. The contractual indemnification rights, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and which are set forth in
_Section 5.09(d)_  of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.09_ (i) are intended, after
the Closing, to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or
her representatives, (ii) shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and (iii) shall not
be amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including
their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified
Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

 

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.09_ are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.09_ , is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the

 



57  Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 5.09_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under
any such policies.

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any Takeover Statute is
or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take
all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize (to the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover
Statute on such transactions.

 

Section 5.11 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period ending on December 31,
2017, Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to provide to each individual who is an employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and who
remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, following the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
(i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than the base salary
or wage rate provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity and/or cash commission
opportunity (if applicable) that is not less favorable than the aggregate
annual cash bonus opportunity and/or cash commission opportunity (if
applicable) (excluding any award opportunity under any "Spot Award Policy" or
any "Recognition Award" (in each case, as defined in _Section 3.13_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter)) provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided under the severance plan,
policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iv) long-term
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those
provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (if any) and (v) other compensation and benefits (including
retirement and welfare benefits and paid-time off, but excluding long-term
incentive, equity-based or equity-linked compensation) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the other compensation and benefits provided
to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.11(a)_ , from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the Companys and
the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance, retention and termination
plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change
in control or severance agreement between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with any other event); _provided_ , _that_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) from
amending, suspending or terminating any such arrangements in accordance with
their terms.

 



58 (c) For all purposes (including for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for
purposes of defined benefit pension accruals)) under any "employee benefit
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to
whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, including any vacation,
paid time off and severance plans, each Company Employees service with or
otherwise credited by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated
as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in
which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) If requested by Parent in writing at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any Company Benefit Plan
that is a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated effective
as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent requests that the Company
401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence
that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent) not later than two (2) Business Days
immediately preceding the Effective Time, and the Company Employees shall be
eligible to participate, effective as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, in a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code sponsored or maintained by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Parent shall take all actions
necessary to permit the Company Employees who are then actively employed to
make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination
thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance (including earnings
thereon) distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment or adoption of any Company Benefit Plan or any other
arrangement or create any

 



59  rights or obligations except between the parties hereto, (ii) give any
employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or
any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any
right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement (including this _Section
5.11_ ) or entitle any person not a party to this Agreement to assert any
claim hereunder, or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan, except in
accordance with the terms of such plan or (B) retain the employment of any
particular employee.

 

(g) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a true and
complete list of all Company Options and RSUs outstanding as of the Closing
Date, specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, (i) the name of each holder,
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option or RSU, and (iii) the exercise price for each such Company Option.

 

(h) In connection with the Banking Business Transaction, the Company shall
consult with and reasonably consider the views of Parent prior to agreeing to
the Company Employees who will be listed as Business Employees within the
meaning of the Bank Purchase Agreement.

Section 5.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expense. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in _Article II_.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all sales, use, value added,
documentary, stamp duty, gross receipts, registration, transfer, transfer
gain, conveyance, excise, recording, license and other similar taxes and fees
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid when due by Parent, Sub
or, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.13 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to take such actions as may
be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or
director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Section 5.14 _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall control, and shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in, and, in any event, consult
with Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to, any material
developments regarding, the defense of any Proceeding brought by stockholders
of the Company against the Company or its directors or officers arising out
of or relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the
date hereof; provided, however, that the Company shall not settle any such
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such
settlement (a)(i) is solely for monetary damages entirely covered within the
limits of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries insurance policies
(other than the deductible under insurance policies) and (ii) is to provide
additional disclosure in the Proxy Statement that does not (x) disparage
Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of the respective
affiliates or businesses of the foregoing or the impact or

 



60  effect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) involve the
disclosure of competitively sensitive information of Parent, Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of the respective affiliates or businesses
and (b) if Parent is a named party in such Proceeding, Parent receives the
same release as the Company.

 

Section 5.15 _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver a statement, dated as of the Closing Date and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that satisfies the requirements of Treasury
Regulation §§ 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) to certify that the Company Common
Stock is not a U.S. real property interest.

Company be required to pay to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_. In no event shall Parent be required to pay to
the Company more than one Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.02(b)_. In the event that Parent receives full payment of the Company

Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against the Company and
the Companys Related Parties for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
Parent, Sub, any of their respective Related Parties or any other person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, whether such Losses are

assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim

Parents Related Parties for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the
Company or any of its Related Parties or any other person in connection with

transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, whether such Losses are based on
contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a
party hereto or another person or otherwise _)_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in the event of a willful and material breach by Parent or Sub of
_Section 5.06_ with respect to their obligations relating to obtaining
clearance of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, in addition to the Parent Termination
Fee paid to the Company by Parent under _Section 7.02(b)(iv)_ , the Company
shall be entitled to pursue one or more claims for damages against Parent in
an aggregate amount not to exceed an additional $115,000,000.

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 8.06(d)_ , this Agreement may
be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, there may not be any amendment of this Agreement
that decreases the Merger Consideration or that adversely affects the rights
of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of the Companys
stockholders at a duly convened meeting of the Companys stockholders called
to obtain approval of such amendment. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 8.06(d)_ , at any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the

the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any

66  covenants or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there may not be any
extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the Merger Consideration
or that adversely affects the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder
without the approval of the Companys stockholders at a duly convened meeting
of the Companys stockholders called to obtain approval of such extension or
waiver. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 8.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 



68 Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that each of Parent and Sub may assign this
Agreement and any of its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Company to (a) any of the Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements to the
extent necessary for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning this Agreement and its rights hereunder as collateral in
respect of the Debt Financing or (b) to any of its affiliates; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Sub of
any of their respective obligations hereunder. Any assignment or transfer in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. 

Section 8.06 _Parties in Interest_.

 

(a) Except for (i) _Article II_ , which, after the Closing, shall be for the
benefit of any person entitled to payment thereunder and (ii)  _Section 5.09_
, which, after the Closing, shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her
representatives, Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under clauses (i) and (ii) of the
preceding sentence shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
may be subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section
7.04_ without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 8.10(c)_ solely with respect to the Equity
Financing Sources, any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. Subject to _Sections 7.02(c)_ and  _8.10(c)_ ,
other than each Equity Financing Source that is party to the Equity Commitment
Letter and then solely with respect to the Equity Financing Sources
obligations thereunder, no former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, members, managers, agents, affiliates, general or limited partners
or assignees of the Company, Parent, Sub, the Equity Financing Sources or of
any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling
person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member, manager, trustee
general or limited partner, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, " _Related Parties_ ") shall have any liability or
obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
obligations or liabilities of the Company,

 



69  Parent or Sub under this Agreement or of or for any action, suit,
arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions (including
the Merger)), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law or
otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate or
partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or
another person or otherwise.

(c) Except as provided in _Section 8.10(c)_ solely with respect to the Equity
Financing Sources or any Equity Commitment Letter and then solely with
respect to the Equity Financing Sources obligations thereunder,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the Company
or any of its Related Parties (other than Parent and Sub) shall have
any rights or claims against any Financing Sources in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing, any Alternative Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights
or claims against the Company or any of its Related Parties (other than
Parent and Sub) in connection with this Agreement, the Financing, any
Alternative Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise (other than the
Financing Sources rights in _Section 8.06(d)_); _provided_ that, following
consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the
parties to the Financing or Alternative Financing under any commitment letter
related thereto. No Financing Source shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortuous nature.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Debt Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Sections 5.07(d)_ ,
_7.02_ , _8.05_ , _8.06(c)_ , _8.08(c)_ , _8.08(d)_ and this _Section 8.06(d)_
, and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Debt
Financing Sources and the Debt Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on
and enforce the provisions of such Sections and (y) _Sections 5.07(d)_ ,
_7.02_ , _8.05_ , _8.06(c)_ , _8.08(c)_ , _8.08(d)_ and this _Section 8.06(d)_
(and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the
substance of such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified in any manner that impacts or is otherwise adverse in any
respect to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
Debt Financing Sources.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Equity Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Sections 7.02_ ,

_8.10_ and this _Section 8.06_ (and any other provision of this Agreement to
the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such
provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that impacts or is
otherwise adverse in any respect to the Equity Financing Sources without the
prior written consent of the Equity Financing Sources; _provided_ , _however_
, in no event shall anything herein (including this  _Section 8.06_ ) limit,
impair or otherwise affect in any respect any of Parents or any of its
affiliates or the Companys or any of its affiliates rights against any of
the Equity 

 



70  Financing Sources or any of their affiliates (or any of the obligations of
the Equity Financing Sources or any of their affiliates to Parent and its
affiliates or the Company and its affiliates) under the Equity Commitment
Letter or any other Contract between or among any of them.

Section 8.07 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (a) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice
versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders;
(c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders;
and (d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As
used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and words of
similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections," "Annexes"
and "Exhibits," are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and the
Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to
"$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. The term "or" shall not be deemed
to be exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References herein
to "as of the date hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement" or words of
similar import shall be deemed to mean "as of immediately prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement." Whenever the phrase "has not had
and would not be reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect" is used, "has not had" shall be construed to mean "has not had since
January 1, 2016". The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties hereto agree that the Financing is the responsibility of Parent
and Sub and not the Company or any Company Subsidiary and that (i) the
Company makes no representations or warranties relating to the Financing
(including whether the Company has authorized the Financing or whether any of
the transactions contemplated by the Financing conflict with or violate any
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party), (ii) except for _Section
5.07(d)_ , none of the covenants of the Company in this Agreement require
the Company to take any action relating to the Financing and (iii) for
purposes of the representations and warranties and covenants and obligations
of the Company hereunder, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not include the Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that (A) except as set forth in
_Section 3.25_ , the Company makes no representations or warranties relating
to the Bank Purchase Agreement, the Banking Entities or the Banking Business
(including any Indebtedness of any Banking Entity), (B) the Company shall be
permitted to take any actions required by the Bank Purchase Agreement or any
other agreements or documents related thereto and doing so shall not be
considered a breach or violation of this Agreement and (C) no Banking Business
Transaction shall be considered a Competing Proposal unless it meets the
requirements set forth in the definition thereof.

 



71 Section 8.08 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law thereof that would require the application of the Laws of any
other jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other
party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware
state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each
of the parties agrees not to commence any Proceeding relating thereto except
in the courts in the State of Delaware, as described above, other than actions
in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or
award rendered by any such court. Each of the parties further agrees that
notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process, and
the parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient.
Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Delaware, as
described above, for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Proceeding in any such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THE FINANCING, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND
ANY CONTROVERSY AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
