Interpretation; Headings</U>. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement,
whenever the context requires:&nbsp;(a) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and
(d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words &#147;include&#148; and &#147;including,&#148; and words of similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be
deemed to be followed by the words &#147;without limitation.&#148; Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to &#147;Sections,&#148; &#147;Annexes&#148; and &#147;Exhibits,&#148; are intended to refer to Sections of this

&#147;as of the date of this Agreement&#148; or words of similar import shall be deemed to mean &#147;as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement.&#148; Whenever the phrase &#147;has not had and would not be reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect&#148; is used, &#147;has not had&#148; shall be construed to mean &#147;has not had since January 1, 2016&#148;. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the Financing is the responsibility of Parent and Sub and not the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and that (i) the Company makes no representations or warranties relating to the Financing (including whether the Company has authorized the Financing or whether any of the transactions contemplated by the Financing conflict with or
violate any obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party), (ii) except for <U>Section 5.07(d)</U>, none of the covenants of the Company in this Agreement require the
Company to take any action relating to the Financing and (iii) for purposes of the representations and warranties and covenants and obligations of the Company hereunder, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not include the
Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that (A) except as set forth in <U>Section 3.25</U>, the Company makes no representations or warranties relating to the Bank Purchase Agreement, the
