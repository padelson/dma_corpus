Schedule, as applicable, shall become final and binding upon the Parties on
the date (the "Final Settlement Date") that is the earlier of (i) forty-five
(45) days after receipt of the Closing Adjustment Certificate by Seller,
unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement ("Notice of

submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by either Seller or Buyer for
review and resolution. The hearing date shall be scheduled by the Independent
Accounting Firm as soon as reasonably practicable and shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. Seller and Buyer shall, not later than seven (7) days
prior to the hearing date set by the Independent Accounting Firm, submit a

shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render a decision (which
decision shall include a written statement of findings and conclusions,
including a written explanation of its reasoning with respect to such findings
and conclusions) resolving the matters in dispute in accordance with this
Section 2.4(d), and the Final Adjustment Certificate reflecting such decision,

Parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the dispute from
arbitration. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) act as an independent
accounting firm and not as an expert, (ii) address only those items in

Section 2.4(d) shall be borne by the Parties in inverse proportion to their
respective success on the merits and such allocation of fees and expenses

binding on the Parties. For example, if Buyer's computation of the Adjustment
Amount set forth on the Closing Adjustment Certificate is different from the
Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate as adjusted by
the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) by ten percent
(10%), and Seller's computation of the Adjustment Amount set forth on the
Notice of Disagreement is different from the Adjustment Amount set forth on
the Final Adjustment Certificate by five percent (5%), then two-thirds of the
fees and expenses relating to the appointment of the Independent Accounting
Firm and the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm
will be paid by Buyer and one-third of such fees and expenses shall be paid by
Seller. As used in this Agreement, the term "Final Adjustment Certificate"
shall mean the Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered (or deemed delivered)
pursuant to Section 2.4(b), as subsequently adjusted, if applicable, pursuant
to this Section 2.4(d) to reflect any subsequent written agreement between the

Firm, any amendments or modifications to the Closing Adjustment Certificate
decided by the Independent Accounting Firm calculated in accordance with
Schedule C.

(iii) Any Excess Payment shall be paid by Seller to Buyer, not later than ten
(10) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by Buyer.

Section 2.5 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
any and all Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be the responsibility of Buyer. To the extent any
such Transfer Taxes are paid or payable by Seller, Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for such Transfer Taxes, upon Buyer's receipt of reasonably
satisfactory evidence of the amount of such Transfer Taxes. The Parties will
reasonably cooperate in the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns or other
documentation in connection with any Transfer Taxes subject to this Section
2.5, including joining in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation to the extent required by Law.

Section 2.6 Pre-Closing Transactions. Seller and its Affiliates (including the

or advisable to effectuate the purposes of the transactions contemplated in
Section 6.1(b)(vii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any other transaction
contemplated hereby without the consent of Buyer.

Section 2.7 Withholding Taxes. (a)The Parties acknowledge that the sale of all Company Interests from Seller
to Buyer is subject to Chilean Withholding Taxes on account of (i) the
assignment of social rights (cesion de derechos sociales) representing the
Company Interests issued by ISL (the "Direct Withholding Taxes") and (ii) the
instrument of transfer of shares representing the Company Interests issued by
Chilean Holdco (the "Indirect Withholding Taxes").

(b)For each of the Direct Withholding Taxes and the Indirect Withholding
Taxes, Seller shall determine, in its sole discretion, as required by
applicable law, the mechanism under which Chilean Withholding Taxes shall
apply. Buyer shall withhold and pay any Direct Withholding Taxes and any
Indirect Withholding Taxes as directed by Seller in the Funds Flow Schedule
and the Closing Adjustment Certificate (if applicable), according to Seller's
determination above. To the extent there is an overpayment of the Direct
Withholding Taxes or the Indirect Withholding Taxes, Seller shall be entitled
to such overpayment amount and Seller shall control any refund claim for any
such overpayment amount. Buyer shall, at the request of Seller, cooperate,
apply or request for, or provide reasonable assistance to Seller in obtaining,
any refund for any such overpayment amount, including by filing appropriate
documentation with the Servicio de Impuestos Internos.

(c)Solely for withholding taxes in Chile, Bermuda and the Netherlands other
than the Direct Withholding Taxes and the Indirect Withholding Taxes (the
"Other Withholding Taxes"), Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Buyer is required by applicable Laws to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment in accordance with applicable Laws.
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Seller with at
least seven (7) Business Days' notice of the applicability of any such
withholding prior to making such withholding, and shall afford Seller a
reasonable opportunity to provide any applicable certificates, forms or
documentation that would reduce or eliminate the requirement to withhold Tax
under applicable Laws. The Parties shall work together in good faith to
minimize any Other Withholding Taxes.

(d)To the extent that amounts are withheld by Buyer under Section 2.7(b) or
Section 2.7(c), such withheld and deducted amounts will be paid as promptly as
possible and in any event within the time periods provided under applicable
Laws to the applicable Tax authority and, to the extent so paid to such Tax
authority, will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Persons in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer; provided, that, Buyer shall furnish Seller with evidence of
payment of the respective withholding Taxes as soon as possible but not later
than ten (10) Business Days after payment was, or is to be, made to the
corresponding Tax authorities in accordance with applicable Laws.

Disclosure Schedule, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Buyer set forth in Article V, neither the execution and delivery

ARTICLE V.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING BUYER

On the date hereof, and for purposes of Section 8.2 only as of the Closing,
Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

Section 5.1 Organization. Buyer is a private company limited by shares duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of Hong Kong
and Buyer has all requisite organizational power and authority to carry on its
business as it is currently conducted and to own, lease and operate its
properties where such properties are now owned, leased or operated. Buyer is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensure
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer. Section 5.2 Authorization. Buyer has all requisite organizational power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is or will be a party, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Transaction. The execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and such other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the Transaction have been duly authorized by
all necessary organizational action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Remedies Exception.

Section 5.3 Noncontravention. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party
by Buyer, nor the consummation by Buyer of the Transaction (a) conflicts with
any provision of the Governing Documents of Buyer, or (b) violates or result

other arrangement to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party or by
which any of their respective properties are bound, or (c) assuming receipt of
the Consents described in Section 5.4, violates any Law to which Buyer or any
of its Affiliates is subject, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), for
such violations or breaches as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer.

Section 5.4 Government Authorizations. No Consent of, with or to any
Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by Buyer or the

Section 5.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule.

Section 5.5 Financial Capacity. Buyer has, and will have prior to the Closing,
sufficient cash or other sources of immediately available funds to pay in cash
the Final Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of Article II and for
all other actions necessary for Buyer to consummate the Transaction and
perform its obligations hereunder. Buyer acknowledges that receipt or
availability of funds or financing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall not
be a condition to Buyer's obligations hereunder. No funds to be paid to Seller
have derived from or will have been derived from, or constitute, either
directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any criminal activity or otherwise in
violation of any Laws, including any Anti-Money Laundering Laws.

Section 5.6 Investment. Buyer is aware that the Company Interests being
acquired by Buyer pursuant to the Transaction have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or under any
state securities Laws. Buyer is not an underwriter, as such term is defined
under the Securities Act, and Buyer is purchasing the Company Interests for
its own account solely for investment and not with a view toward, or for sale
in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act, nor with any present intention of distributing or selling any
of the Company Interests. Buyer and its Affiliates acknowledge that none of
them may sell or otherwise dispose of the Company Interests except in
compliance with the registration requirements or exemption provisions under
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any other applicable securities Laws. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as
defined under Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act. Section 5.7 Litigation. (a) There are no Actions pending or, to Buyer's
Knowledge, threatened in writing in law before any Governmental Authority
against Buyer or any of its Affiliates that would have a Material Adverse

aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer.

Section 5.8 Brokers' Fees. None of Buyer or any of its Affiliates has any

implied) with any Person which may result in the obligation of Seller, the
Company Entities or any of their Affiliates to pay any fees or commissions to
any broker or finder as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer is or will be a
party or the consummation of the Transaction.

Section 5.9 Information.

(a)Buyer has relied solely on its own legal, tax and financial advisers for
its evaluation of its investment decision to purchase the Company Interests
and to enter into this Agreement and not on the advice of Seller or its legal,
tax or financial advisers. Buyer acknowledges that any financial projections
that may have been provided to it are based on assumptions of future operating
results based on assumptions about certain events (many of which are beyond
the control of Seller). Buyer understands that no assurances or
representations can be given that the actual results of the operations of any
Company Entity will conform to the projected results for any period. Buyer
specifically acknowledges that no representation or warranty has been made,
and that Buyer has not relied on any representation or warranty, as to the
accuracy of any projections, estimates or budgets, future revenues, future
results from operations, future cash flows, the future condition (whether
financial or other) of any Company Entity, or the businesses or assets
thereof, or, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, any other
information or documents made available to Buyer, its Affiliates or its or
their respective Representatives or equity holders.

(b)Buyer and its Representatives and equity holders, acknowledge and agree
that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, nor any of its or their
respective Representatives or equity holders, is making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in
Article III and Article IV, including any implied warranty or representation
as to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular
purpose or trade as to any of the assets of any of the Company Entities.

(c)Seller and the Company Entities have provided Buyer with such access to the
facilities, books, records and personnel of the Company Entities as Buyer has
deemed necessary and appropriate in order for Buyer to investigate to its
satisfaction the businesses and properties of the Company Entities
sufficiently to make an informed investment decision to purchase the Company
Interests and to enter into this Agreement. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its purchase
of the Company Interests and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
purchase. Buyer's acceptance of the Company Interests on the Closing Date
shall be based upon its own investigation, examination and determination with
respect thereto as to all matters and without reliance upon any express or
implied representations or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or
imputed to Seller, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Section 5.10 No Adverse Proceedings. (a) No fact or circumstance exists to the
Knowledge of Buyer, (b) no current holding or transaction is under
consideration by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and (c) no actual, pending,
or threatened proceeding or investigation by or before any Governmental
Authority exists, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially condition (i) any filings or approvals required under any
applicable Laws, including the Anti-Trust Laws, or (ii) the consummation of
the Transaction.

Section 5.11 Solvency. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.
Immediately after giving effect to the Transaction, including the making of
the payments contemplated by Article II, and assuming satisfaction of the
conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Transaction, the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of Seller and the Company Entities set
forth herein and the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder in all
material respects, following the Closing each of the Company Entities will be
Solvent.

hours to review information and documentation relative to the properties,

such investigation shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel and operations of
the Company Entities and shall be at Buyer's sole cost and expense. All such
requests for books and records of the Company Entities shall be made to such
Representatives of Seller as Seller shall designate, who shall be solely
responsible for coordinating all such requests. It is further agreed that none
of Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives shall, prior to
the Closing Date, contact any Person that Buyer knows to be an employee,
customer, supplier, distributor, contractor, lender or agent of any of the
Company Entities, or any Governmental Authority or Representatives thereof, in
connection with the Transaction, whether in person or by telephone, mail or
other means of communication, without the prior written consent of Seller,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any access to the books
and records of the Company Entities shall require at least five (5) days
advance written notice by Buyer to Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Seller shall not be required to provide any access or
information to Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, whether during the Interim Period or after the Closing, which
Seller reasonably believes it or the Company Entities are prohibited from
providing to Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives by
reason of applicable Law, which constitutes or allows access to information
protected by attorney-client privilege, or which Seller or its Affiliates (or,
prior to the Closing, the Company Entities) are required to keep confidential
or prevent access to by reason of any Contract with a third party or which
would otherwise expose Seller or its Affiliates (or, prior to the Closing, the
Company Entities) to a material risk of Liability.

(b)Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall hold in
confidence all Confidential Information obtained from Seller, the Company
Entities or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, whether or not
relating to the business of the Company Entities, in accordance with the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (in each case as if Buyer and
Seller were directly a party thereto), which, notwithstanding anything
contained therein, shall remain in full force and effect following the
execution of this Agreement and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. (c)From and after the Closing until the one (1) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause each of its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to (i) maintain in strict confidence, as such
Person maintains its own confidential information, any and all information
concerning the Company Entities and (ii) refrain from using such information
concerning the Company Entities for its own benefit or to the detriment of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company Entities). It is understood
that none of Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives shall have any liability hereunder with respect to any
information that (i) was previously known on a non-confidential basis by such
Person (other than as a result of Seller's prior ownership of the Company
Entities), (ii) is in or, through no fault of Seller or Seller's Affiliates or
any of their respective Representatives, comes into the public domain, (iii)
Seller is legally required by a Governmental Authority to disclose, (iv) is
disclosed in connection with the reporting obligations under the Securities
Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of Seller or any of
Seller's parent entities or (v) is later lawfully acquired by such Person from
sources other than Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company Entities)
that are not, to such Person's knowledge at the time of disclosure, under any
obligation to Buyer or Affiliates (including the Company Entities) to keep
such information confidential. In the event that Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives is required by Law to disclose
any such information, to the extent practical and permitted by Law, such
Person will promptly notify Buyer in writing so that Buyer may seek a
protective order and/or other motion to prevent or limit the production or
disclosure of such information; if such motion is denied, then such Person may
disclose only such portion of such information that (i) in the opinion of
Seller's legal counsel is required by Law to be disclosed (provided, that such
Person will use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the remainder of such information) or (ii) Buyer consents
in writing to having disclosed.

(d)If this Agreement terminates prior to the Closing, each of Seller and Buyer
shall as soon as reasonably practicable upon written request by the other
Party:

(i) (where Buyer is the recipient of any Confidential Information) return to
Seller all written Confidential Information relating to Seller and its
Affiliates, the Company Entities and this Agreement which Seller (or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives) has provided to Buyer (or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives) without keeping any copies
thereof;

(ii) (where Seller is the recipient of any Confidential Information) return to
Seller all written Confidential Information relating to Buyer and its
Affiliates, the Company Entities and this Agreement which Buyer (or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives) has provided to Seller (or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives) without keeping any copies
thereof;

(iii) so far as it is practicable to do so, destroy all Confidential
Information; and

(iv) so far as it is practicable to do so, expunge such Confidential
Information from any computer, word processor or other device,

provided that, a Party, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
(1) may retain copies of the Confidential Information in accordance with any
bone fide policies and procedures implemented by such Persons in order to
comply with applicable Law, professional standards or reasonable business
practice, and (2) may retain Confidential Information which forms part of the
minutes of the board or an investment committee, or any legal advice, due
diligence report, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies or other
documents prepared by such Party, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives, provided that (in each case) the relevant Party, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives undertake to maintain such
Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to any Person for a
period of one (1) year from the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise

other Tax Return of the Company Entities with respect to a taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) for any taxable period ending

obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax
liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or
other document received from any Governmental Authority or any other Person in

responses to, Tax Governmental Authorities), (2) keep Buyer reasonably and
timely informed of the developments and status of any such Tax Proceeding
controlled by Seller, and (3) not settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding
without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Seller does not elect to control the

(iv) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section
6.7(e) and Section 8.4 (to the extent applicable), this Section 6.7(e) shall
control.

(f) At Seller's request, Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Company Entity
following the Closing) shall apply for any Tax refund available for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (as long as
such refund claim is based on a position that is at least at a "more likely
than not" chance of success). Seller shall be entitled to an amount equal to
the product of (i) the relevant Applicable Percentage, and (ii) any Tax
refunds or credits received by or credited to Buyer or its Affiliates
(including any Company Entity following the Closing) with respect to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date
(collectively, "Tax Refunds"). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller
the amount of Seller's share of any Tax Refund (plus any interest actually
received with respect thereto from an applicable Governmental Authority), net
of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred in
connection with receiving such Tax Refund and net of any Taxes that were or
would be incurred by any Company Entity or Buyer in distributing the amount of
such Tax Refund to Buyer, within ten (10) days of receipt of or entitlement of
such Tax Refund. With respect to any Straddle Period, the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any Company Entity following the Closing) shall pay to
Seller, within thirty (30) days of the due date (after taking into account any
extensions) of the applicable Straddle Period Return, an amount equal to the
product of (i) the relevant Applicable Percentage, and (ii) the excess of (1)
any estimated Tax payments made by the Seller or its Affiliates (including any
Company Entity prior to Closing) for the taxable period that includes the
Closing Date, over (2) the Pre-Closing Taxes for such taxable year (with
respect to Taxes for which estimated Tax payments were made) as calculated
according to Section 6.7(g).

(g) In the case of Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to the income,
property or operations of the Company Entities that relate to the Straddle
Period, the portion of such Taxes and Tax liabilities that constitute Pre-
Closing Taxes shall: (i) in the case of Taxes other than those described in
clause (ii) below, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding taxable period)
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or
related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible) as determined from the books and
records of the Company Entities as though the taxable year of the Company
Entities terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date. For purposes
of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item (including, without limitation, the effect of any graduated rates
of Tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis
determined by multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the
Straddle Period times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon
or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles,
any amount thereof required to be allocated under this Section 6.7(g) shall be
computed by reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date. The
parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the
relevant Governmental Authority to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a
short taxable period ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

Sempra Energy or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Company Entity, on
the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date.

provide to the other Party such cooperation and information, as and to the
extent reasonably requested and reasonably necessary, in connection with (i)
preparing, reviewing or filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund of or with respect to the Company Entities, (ii) determining
Liabilities for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes of or with respect to the
Company Entities, or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding of or with respect to
the Company Entities. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any Tax Proceeding involving or otherwise relating to
the Company Entities (or their income or assets) with respect to any Tax and
each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as
are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 6.7(i). Any information
obtained under this Section 6.7(i) shall be kept confidential, except as may
be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Tax Proceeding.

Section 6.8 Insurance. After the Closing Date (a) the Company Entities shall
cease to be insured by, have access or availability to, be entitled to make
claims on, or be entitled to claim benefits or seek coverage under, any of

responsible for obtaining or providing insurance coverage for the Company
Entities for any event or occurrence after the Closing sufficient to comply
with any and all of the contractual and statutory obligations of the Company
Entities.

Section 6.9 Termination of Affiliate Contracts. At or prior to the Closing,
except as set forth in Section 6.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (a)
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities), on the one hand,
and the Company Entities, on the other hand, shall pay, settle, net, cancel,
forgive or release any Liabilities under the Intercompany Accounts between
such Persons, or Seller shall cause any such Intercompany Accounts to be
transferred to or from the Company Entities, such that the Company Entities,
on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company
Entities), on the other hand, do not have any further Liability to one another
in respect of such Intercompany Accounts following Closing, and (b) the
Affiliate Contracts, other than those set forth in Section 6.9 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, shall be terminated without any further force or effect.

Section 6.10 Post-Closing Commercially Reasonable Efforts. After the Closing,
the Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
take any actions that would restrict or prevent its or their ability to
perform its or their post-Closing covenants and agreements hereunder,
including any action that would make its or their "commercially reasonable
efforts" materially less likely to produce the intended result. Further, as part of the Parties' "commercially reasonable efforts," the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, enforce their
rights under any agreements that would reasonably be expected to yield the
intended results. Buyer shall not, and shall cause Eletrans II not to, cause
or contribute to any Eletrans Delays. Buyer shall, and shall cause Eletrans II
to, (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to continue the development and
construction of the Power Facilities of Eletrans II, (b) obtain, as soon as
practicable, all Consents of, or other permission or action by, and to give
all notices to, and make all filings with and applications and submissions to,
any Governmental Authority or other Person as are necessary for the
development and construction of the Power Facilities of Eletrans II,
(including the petition filed before the Ministry of Energy of Chile in
connection therewith for the extension of milestone dates without monetary
penalty to Eletrans II), and (c) diligently defend all Actions challenging the
Power Facilities of Eletrans II.

Section 6.11 Employee Relations and Benefits. Following the Closing Date for a
period of eighteen (18) months, Buyer shall cause the Company Entities to
comply in all material respects with all agreements benefitting the employees
of the Company Entities set forth in Section 6.11 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule who remain in the employment of Buyer or any Company Entity or any of
their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries or successors immediately following
the Closing (the "Continuing Employees").

conditions of this Agreement and applicable Laws, the Parties shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to cooperate and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transaction as soon as
practicable in order to cause any of the conditions to such other Party's
obligation to consummate the Transaction specified in Article VII to be fully
satisfied.

Section 6.13 Post-Closing Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer each agree that
from time to time after the Closing Date, they shall execute and deliver or
cause their respective Affiliates (including, with respect to Buyer, causing
the Company Entities) to execute and deliver such further instruments, and

causing the Company Entities to take) such other action, as may be reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

to, cease using the Trademarks set forth in Section 6.14(a) of the Seller

its Affiliates and the Company Entities have no rights whatsoever to use the
Seller Trademarks or other Excluded Intellectual Property. Without limiting
the foregoing:

Company Entity whose name contains any of the Seller Trademarks to change its
name to a name that does not contain any of the Seller Marks, to make all
necessary filings with relevant Governmental Authorities to change its name to
a name that does not contain any of the Seller Marks, and to amend all of the

above is completed, Buyer shall provide evidence to Seller in a format that is
reasonably acceptable to Seller that Buyer has made all filings to
Governmental Authorities required by clause (i) above; and

(iii) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall and shall

Property and any other material assets, and to dispose of any unused

Entities to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 6.14,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company Entities to, comply with, in all
material respects, all of Seller's and its Affiliates' reasonable quality
control requirements, policies and guidelines in effect at such time that have
been provided to Buyer in writing by Seller from time to time during the use
of the Seller Marks in accordance with this Section 6.14.

(c) Buyer, the Company Entities and their Affiliates shall not be deemed to
have violated their obligations under this Section 6.14 by reason of any
solely internal use of the Seller Trademarks in relation to the internal
business records of the Company Entities which are in existence as of the

Company Entity or who, at the request of such Company Entity, served as a
director, alternate director or officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such individual's
heirs, executors or administrators, the "Indemnified Persons") in connection
with any action or omission by any such Indemnified Person occurring or
alleged to have occurred on or before the Closing Date or indemnification
agreements to which such Company Entity is a party which have been made
available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Closing Date, and (ii) the provisions with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability set forth in the Governing
Documents of such Company Entity shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date;
provided, that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within
such six (6)-year period, all rights to indemnification or limitation on
liability in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final
disposition of any and all such claims. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the written consent
of the Indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, that such consent shall not be required if
(i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general
release to all Indemnified Persons affected by the claim, and (ii) the
settlement is for money damages only in an amount that is fully indemnified by
the Indemnifying Party (including any related defense costs and expenses).

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall cause each Company Entity to indemnify to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law all Indemnified Persons with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of such individuals' services as
officers, directors, alternate directors, employees or agents of such Company
Entity or as trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of employees
of such Company Entity, occurring prior to the Closing, including the
execution of, and the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Buyer
contained in this Section 6.15 shall be binding upon the successors and
assigns of Buyer and the Company Entities. In the event Buyer or any of the
Company Entities, or any of their respective successors or assigns, (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Buyer or the relevant Company Entity, as the case may be, honor the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section 6.15.

(d) The obligations of Buyer under this Section 6.15 shall survive the Closing
and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect
adversely any Indemnified Person to whom this Section 6.15 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnified Persons to whom this Section 6.15 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.15, each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this Section 6.15).

Section 6.16 Registration and Publication of Excerpt. Buyer shall, within five
(5) days after the Closing Date, submit or cause the submission of an excerpt
of the amendment to the assignment of equity rights in ISL to be executed at
Closing pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iv) and Section 2.3(c)(iii) above for
registration before the competent Commercial Registry (Registro de Comercio)
and simultaneously or shortly thereafter request the publication of such
excerpt in the Chilean Official Gazette. The registration and publication of
such excerpt shall be accomplished as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date but in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date. Buyer shall keep the Seller duly informed about all matters involving
such registration and publication, including providing evidence of such
registration and publication as soon as possible but in any event not later
than two (2) days after each of them has been completed.

Section 6.17 Post-signing Breach Notification. (a) Seller may, at any time up to the Closing, notify Buyer in writing of the
discovery by Seller of any act or omission, event, condition, fact or
circumstance (whether it occurred or existed on, prior to, or after the date
of this Agreement) that constitutes, or may with the passing of time
constitute, a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement ("Post-signing Breach Notification"). A Post-signing Breach
Notification shall include details consistent with the amount of detail
provided in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, but shall not be deemed a
supplement or amendment of the Seller Disclosure Schedule for any purpose
under this Agreement.

(b) If the breach of any of Seller's representations or warranties set forth
in a Post-signing Breach Notification, individually or in the aggregate with
any other Post-signing Breach Notification, results in Buyer's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii), Buyer may terminate
this Agreement by providing a written termination notice pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(iii) within five (5) Business Days after receiving such Post-signing
Breach Notification. If Buyer does not terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the preceding sentence, without prejudice to any other provisions, (i)
the conditions to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the Transaction under
Section 7.3(a)(i) and Section 7.3(b) shall not be deemed to fail to be
satisfied solely as a result of such Post-signing Breach Notification and (ii)
Buyer shall not be entitled to the indemnification rights set forth in Article
VIII with respect to the breach of representations or warranties set forth in
such Post-signing Breach Notification.

(c) If the breach of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in a
Post-signing Breach Notification does not, individually or in the aggregate
with any other Post-signing Breach Notification, result in Buyer's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii), Buyer shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii) or
otherwise but shall be otherwise entitled to all its other rights and remedies
under this Agreement, including the indemnification rights set forth in
Article VIII, with respect to such breach of Seller's representations or
warranties.

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.17 shall reduce, or constitute a waiver of,
Buyer's rights and remedies with respect to a breach of Seller's obligations
(other than a breach of Seller's representations and warranties) under this
Agreement.

contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in Section

(Capitalization), Section 3.4 (Ownership), Section 3.18 (Brokers' Fees),
Section 4.1(Organization), Section 4.2 (Authorization), Section 4.4 (Brokers'
Fees), Section 5.1 (Organization), Section 5.2 (Authorization), Section 5.6
(Investment), Section 5.8 (Brokers' Fees) and Section 5.9 (Information)
(collectively the "Fundamental Representations"), the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.9 (Tax Matters) (the "Tax Representations")
and the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.11
(Environmental Matters) (the "Environmental Representations")), shall survive
for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing. Each of the
Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, each of the Environmental
Representations shall survive the Closing for a period of twenty four (24)
months following the Closing and each of the Tax Representations shall survive

Closing, and all rights to indemnification for a breach of such covenants
shall terminate upon the date that is three (3) months after the Closing Date,
and the Surviving Covenants shall survive the Closing Date until fully
performed. None of Seller, any Company Entity or Buyer shall have any
Liability whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties or
covenants from and after the time such representation or warranty or covenant
ceases to survive hereunder, provided, that any representation or warranty or
covenant shall continue to survive if a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as
applicable) shall have been given prior to such date, until the related claim
for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in
Section 8.4. Section 8.2 Indemnification.

(a)Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, after the Closing
Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i)
any breach of any representations and warranties made by Seller (other than
the Tax Representations), and (ii) any breach, nonfulfillment of or failure to
perform any covenant contained herein (other than the covenants or agreements
set forth in Section 6.1(b)(x)) on the part of Seller.

(b)Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, after the Closing
Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i)
any breach of any representations and warranties made by Buyer, and (ii) any
breach, nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant contained herein
on the part of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

(c)The amount of indemnifiable Damages in respect of any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, a representation or warranty (other than the representations
and warranties in Section 3.8(c) and the phrase "in all material respects"
with respect to the fair representation of the Financial Statements in
accordance with IFRS in Section 3.6), shall be determined as if such
representation and warranty had not contained any limitation or qualification
as to materiality, material adverse change, Material Adverse Effect or similar
language; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply for the purposes of
determining whether a breach or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty in
this Agreement has occurred.

(d)Seller shall not be liable for, and no amounts of indemnity shall be
payable in the case of, any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party for breaches of
representations and warranties, other than the Fundamental Representations, or
covenants unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have suffered,
incurred or sustained otherwise indemnifiable Damages hereunder (after giving
effect to any Indemnity Reduction Amounts) in excess of an amount equal to one
percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price in the aggregate (the "Deductible"),
in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to claim
indemnity for Damages only to the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible
and for such amount in excess.

(e)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall not be
liable, with respect to any individual claim hereunder that results in
otherwise indemnifiable Damages, and such Damages shall not be counted toward
satisfaction of the Deductible, unless such Damages exceed an amount equal to
two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).

(f)The Liability of Seller for indemnification of Damages under this Agreement
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any breach or failure of
representations or warranties made by Seller other than Fundamental
Representations shall be limited to, in the aggregate, an amount equal to
seven point five percent (7.5%) of the Base Purchase Price. (g)The aggregate Liability of Seller and Buyer, respectively, for
indemnification of Damages under this Agreement resulting from, arising out
of, or relating to any breach or failure of representations and warranties
(including Fundamental Representations or Tax Representations) or covenants,
indemnification obligations or otherwise shall be limited to the total amount
of the Base Purchase Price.

(h)The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement shall be reduced by any amounts entitled to be received
(including amounts under insurance policies) by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates from third parties and any Tax benefit to
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the payment
of any such Damages (such amounts and benefits are collectively referred to
herein as "Indemnity Reduction Amounts"). If any Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect of a claim for
which indemnification is provided under this Agreement after the full amount
of such claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying
Party has made a partial payment of such claim and such Indemnity Reduction
Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (ii) the amount of the
indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts
in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made. An
insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim
shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by
virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights
with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer
or any other third party shall be entitled to any benefit they would not be
entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions by virtue
of the indemnification provisions hereof. Each of Seller and Buyer, as
appropriate, shall, or shall cause each Indemnified Party to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue promptly any claims or rights it may
have against all third parties which would reduce the amount of Damages for
which indemnification is provided under this Agreement and take all
commercially reasonable actions to mitigate damages.

(i)For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall include the obligation to pay Damages relating to breaches
which do not arise out of, or involve, any Third-Party Claims.

Section 8.3 Specific Indemnification. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Eletrans II from and against fifty percent (50%) of any and all
monetary fines and penalties actually paid by Eletrans II to any Governmental
Authority for delays resulting from facts, events and circumstances arising
prior to the Closing Date resulting from or arising out of delays in the
achievement of the milestones set forth in the Decree No. 6 and 6T issued by
the Ministry of Energy on October 16, 2013, as amended, for the construction
of the new transmission line projects Alto Melipilla-Rapel and Lo Aguirre-Alto
Melipilla (such delays, the "Eletrans Delays"); provided, that Seller shall
not be liable to indemnify Eletrans II under this Section 8.3 (i) for any
amounts in excess of $13,275,000, individually or in the aggregate or (ii) to
the extent such Eletrans Delays are caused by breach of this Agreement by
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the JV Companies after the Closing). The
obligation of Seller to indemnify pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall terminate
after ten (10) months from the Closing Date. Further, Seller shall indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any matters set forth in Schedule F, subject
to the terms and limitations set forth therein. Section 8.4 Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a)In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 is asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a
Party or any of its Affiliates (other than a claim for Taxes) (a "Third-Party
Claim"), then such Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice promptly to
the Indemnifying Party in accordance with clause (b) below. In case any such
action is brought against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to participate in and to assume and control the defense thereof,
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and after
notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election
so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof; provided, that
the Indemnified Party may participate without obstruction in such defense at
the Indemnified Party's expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, it shall not be obligated to pay
the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
the Indemnified Parties with respect to such Third-Party Claim, unless the
Indemnified Parties shall have been advised by counsel that representation of
any such Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential
differing interests between them, in which case such Indemnified Parties shall
have the right to select separate counsel the reasonable and documented fees
and expenses of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying
Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of
any Third-Party Claim of which it has assumed the defense hereunder without
the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that such consent shall not be
required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional
general release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified
Parties affected by the claim, and (ii) the settlement is for money damages
only. No Indemnifying Party shall be subject to any Liability for any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim made without its consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(b)In the event of any claim or demand, including Third-Party Claims, in
respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice promptly to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that the failure by any Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder
except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced thereby,
and then only to the extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party within the thirty (30)-day period after its
receipt of such Indemnity Notice (the "Dispute Period") as to whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its Liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder.

(c)The Parties shall cooperate to the extent reasonably practicable with one
another with respect to resolving any claim or Liability with respect to which
one Party is obligated to provide indemnification hereunder. (d)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts payable
pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be paid
without duplication, including with respect to duplication of any Liability
that is included in the Final Adjustment Certificate or with respect to the
amount of any Liability for which there is an accrual or reserve contained in
the Financial Statements.

Section 8.5 Limitations on Remedies; Release. (a)EXCEPT FOR ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE IV, THE COMPANY INTERESTS ARE BEING ACQUIRED "AS IS,
WHERE IS," AND SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, AND BUYER HEREBY
WAIVES, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO LIABILITIES, OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESSES, OR ASSETS (INCLUDING
TITLE, CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY THEREOF) OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES OR THE
PROSPECTS (FINANCIAL AND OTHERWISE), RISKS AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THE ASSETS
OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES, OR AS TO ANY OTHER MATTER, AND SELLER AND ITS
AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, USAGE, OR SUITABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS OF THE
COMPANY ENTITIES, OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR AS TO THE WORKMANSHIP THEREOF, OR
THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT, OR RELATING TO
COMPLIANCE WITH OR LIABILITY RELATING TO ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW OR REQUIREMENT,
OR AS TO THE CONDITION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES OR ANY PART
THEREOF, INCLUDING WHETHER THE COMPANY ENTITIES POSSESS THE REQUISITE PERMITS
OR SUFFICIENT REAL PROPERTY OR PERSONAL PROPERTY TO OPERATE THE BUSINESS OF
THE COMPANY ENTITIES, IN EACH CASE EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
HEREIN, SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE CONDITION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY
ENTITIES OR THE SUITABILITY OF ANY PROJECT OWNED BY ANY COMPANY ENTITY FOR
OPERATION OR AS A SITE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL OR REPLACEMENT
GENERATION, TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION CAPACITY FOR ANY PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER
MATTER, AND NO MATERIAL OR INFORMATION OR STATEMENTS PROVIDED BY OR
COMMUNICATIONS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR BY ANY
REPRESENTATIVE, EMPLOYEE, MANAGER, AGENT, ATTORNEY, ADVISOR, CONSULTANT,
ACCOUNTANT, BROKER OR INVESTMENT BANKER, INCLUDING ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL
CONTAINED IN THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MEMORANDUM OR MANAGEMENT
PRESENTATION RECEIVED BY BUYER, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
EQUITYHOLDERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING ANY SUPPLEMENTS), ANY PROJECTIONS
OR FORECASTS, INFORMATION PROVIDED DURING DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING INFORMATION
IN THE ELECTRONIC DATA ROOM, AND ANY ORAL, WRITTEN OR ELECTRONIC RESPONSE TO
ANY INFORMATION REQUEST PROVIDED TO BUYER, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
EQUITYHOLDERS OR REPRESENTATIVES, WILL CAUSE OR CREATE ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE MAY BE RELIED UPON, AS TO THE TITLE, CONDITION, VALUE
OR QUALITY OF THE COMPANY INTERESTS AND THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES OR
ANY OTHER MATTER, OTHER THAN TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN A
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY CONTAINED IN ARTICLES III AND IV HEREIN.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.5(A) SHALL PRECLUDE
OR LIMIT IN ANY MANNER BUYER'S ABILITY TO MAKE A CLAIM AGAINST SELLER FOR
FRAUD.

(b)Except for the obligations of Seller under this Agreement and in the
absence of fraud, for and in consideration of the Company Interests, effective
as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its direct and indirect
equity holders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates (which shall include the Company
Entities after the Closing) and direct and indirect parent companies, and the
Representatives and direct and indirect equity holders of any of the following
and each of their respective successors and assigns (each a "Releasor"),
hereby absolutely and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Seller and its past,
present and future equity holders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and each of the
present and former Representatives, equity holders and control persons of any
of the foregoing, and each of the respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (each, a "Releasee") of, from
and against any and all Actions, causes of action, claims, demands, Damages,
judgments, Liabilities, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and
description whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both in Law and in equity,
in each case to the extent arising out of or resulting from Seller's or such
Releasee's ownership or operation of the Company Entities, whether related to
any period of time before or after the Closing, including any Liability under
Environmental Law. Each Releasor agrees not to, and agrees to cause its
respective equity holders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates (which shall include the
Company Entities after the Closing), Representatives, direct and indirect
parent companies and each of their respective successors and assigns, not to,
assert any claim against the Releasees; provided, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Releasor releases its rights and interests under this Agreement. (c)None of the Seller Indemnified Parties and none of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to any recovery under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document following Closing for any of its or its Affiliates'
special, exemplary, punitive, consequential, incidental or indirect damages
(including any damages on account of lost opportunities or lost or delayed
power generation, transmission or distribution), Regulated Tariff adjustments
or losses based on diminution of value or calculated by reference to any
multiple of earnings or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation or
amortization (or any other valuation methodology) (together, "Indirect
Losses"), provided, however, that if a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer
Indemnified Party is held liable to a Third Party based on any final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction for any such Indirect Losses and the
applicable indemnifying party is obligated to indemnify such Seller
Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party (as applicable) for the matter
that gave rise to such Indirect Losses, then such indemnifying party shall be
liable for, and obligated to reimburse such Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer
Indemnified Party (as applicable) for such Indirect Losses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover any of their or their Affiliates' Indirect Losses
(including lost profits) resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) a
breach by Buyer of any of its obligations contained in Section 6.4, or (ii)
the Buyer's failure to consummate the Transaction in the event that all of the
closing conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of any breach of any
representation and warranty made by Seller that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Buyer if and to the
extent that Buyer had obtained knowledge of such breach through a Post-signing
Breach Notification on or before the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 8.5(d) is without prejudice to the Buyer's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(iii) as a result of such Post-
signing Breach Notification.

(e)After the Closing, except to the extent provided under this Article VIII,
all rights or remedies that any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against
Seller (i) with respect to adverse matters, including contingent Liabilities,
defects (legal or otherwise) and adverse physical or environmental conditions,
that may not have been revealed by Buyer's investigations of the Owned Real
Property or any real property subject to a Real Property Agreement in
connection with the Transaction, and (ii) under or relating to any
Environmental Law or with respect to any Liability under or relating to any
Environmental Law or any other environmental matters relating to any Company
Entity are waived. After the Closing, except as provided in this Agreement,
Buyer hereby agrees, warrants and covenants to (and shall cause the Company
Entities to) release, acquit, forever discharge and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from any and all Liabilities and/or Damages, including all
claims, demands and causes of action for contribution and indemnity under
statute or common Law, that Buyer may have asserted or alleged or are or could
be asserted or alleged now or in the future against any Seller Indemnified
Party in regard to the Owned Real Property or any real property subject to a
Real Property Agreement by reason of or arising out of the physical or
environmental condition thereof, any actual or alleged violation of applicable
Law, including any Environmental Law, and any and all other acts, omissions,
events, circumstances or matters relating to the foregoing or that relate to
or in any way arise pursuant to any Environmental Law or out of any Liability
relating to any Environmental Law or any other environmental matters relating
to any Company Entity.

Section 8.6 Exclusive Remedies. After the Closing, and except in the event of
fraud, the remedies set forth in this Article VIII and Section 6.7 shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating,
directly or indirectly, to the subject matter of this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 6.7, Section
6.3(b), Section 10.12, this Article VIII and Article IX, Buyer hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action it or any of its Affiliates may have against
Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, whether arising under or based upon any Law, other than rights,
claims and causes of action arising out of fraud by Seller.

Section 8.7 Tax Characterization. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to
the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

ARTICLE IX.

TERMINATION Section 9.1 Termination Events. Without prejudice to other remedies which may
be available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may be
terminated, and the Transaction may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing solely in the following cases:

(a)by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

(b)by either Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if
the Closing shall not have occurred by the date that is twelve (12) months
after the date of this Agreement (the "Termination Date"), unless extended by
written agreement of Seller and Buyer; provided, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any Party
whose breach of its obligations under this Agreement has been a cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Transaction to be consummated by such date,
and provided, further, that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if Seller has initiated proceedings

Section 10.4 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed
by the Party sought to be charged with such waiver.

Section 10.5 Exhibits and Schedules. All Exhibits and Schedules attached
hereto and the Disclosure Schedules delivered herewith are hereby incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof.

Section 10.6 Headings. The table of contents and section headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be deemed a part
of this Agreement or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

Section 10.7 Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and the
Exhibits hereto) and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements, or
representations among the Parties of any nature, whether written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.

Section 10.9 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those
as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination that any provision,
or the application of any such provision, is invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the Transaction is fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, under no circumstance
shall the obligation of Seller to deliver the Company Interests be enforceable
absent enforceability of the obligation of Buyer to pay the Final Purchase
Price, and vice versa.

Section 10.10 Expenses.

(a)Buyer shall be obligated to pay any and all costs of any audit of any
Company Entity as may be required to enable Buyer to complete and file any
filing by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer with any Governmental Authority or
otherwise required to be made by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer in order to
cause any of the conditions in Article VII to be fully satisfied. (b)Unless otherwise provided herein, any fees, costs or expenses paid or
payable to third parties (excluding any Affiliate or Subsidiary of a Party)
incurred in connection with obtaining any other Consents required in
connection with the consummation of the Transaction shall be borne by the
relevant Party that incurs such fees, costs and expenses.

(c)Unless otherwise provided herein, including as provided in Section 2.2,
each of Buyer and Seller agrees to pay, without right of reimbursement from
the other, all costs and expenses incurred by it incident to the performance
of its obligations hereunder, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants employed by the
respective Parties in connection with the Transaction, whether or not the
Transaction is consummated.

Section 10.11 No Recourse Against Non-Recourse Persons. All claims,
obligations, Liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort,
in equity or at Law, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), shall be made only
against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified
as Parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "Contracting Parties"). No
Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future
Representative, incorporator, equityholder or Affiliate of such Contracting
Party or any past, present or future Representative, incorporator,
equityholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (the "Non-Recourse
Persons"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in equity
or at Law, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or in its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against any such Non-Recourse Persons.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available in equity or at Law, or granted by statute, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability
of a Contracting Party on any Non-Recourse Persons, whether granted by statute
or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego,
domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Non-Recourse Persons with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement.

Section 10.12 Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) each Party recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by
it of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall cause the
other Party to sustain irreparable harm for which it would not have an
adequate remedy at Law, and therefore in the event of any such breach the
aggrieved Party shall, without the posting of bond or other security (any
requirement for which the Parties hereby waive), be entitled to the remedy of
specific performance of such covenants and agreements, including injunctive
and other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedy to which it might
be entitled, (b) a Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, and (c) in the event that any action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall
allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. The Parties further agree that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.12, a Party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a Party under this Agreement, including monetary damages or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 10.12 are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this
Section 10.12 shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any Party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this Section 10.12 before exercising any termination right under Section
9.1 (and pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement
of any action pursuant to this Section 10.12 or anything contained in this
Section 10.12 restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Section 9.1 or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 10.13 Legal Representation.

(a)It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company Entities and
Seller have retained (i) White and Case LLP, (ii) Claro and Cia, and (iii) the
legal departments of Seller and its Affiliates (collectively, "Seller's
Counsel") to act as their counsel in connection with the Transaction and that
Seller's Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Party in connection
with the Transaction and that none of the other Parties has the status of a
client of any of Seller's Counsel for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that, in the event
that any dispute, or any other matter in which the interests of Seller and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company Entities), on the other hand, are adverse, arises after the Closing
between Buyer or the Company Entities, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, Seller's Counsel may represent any or all of
Seller and its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of Seller
and its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Company Entities,
and even though Seller's Counsel formerly may have represented the Company
Entities in any matter substantially related to such dispute. (b)Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company Entities following the Closing with respect to Buyer) acknowledge and
agree that, in connection with any future disputes, lawsuits, actions,
proceedings, investigations or other matters, including any dispute between
Buyer, the Company Entities or any of its or their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, or with
or between any other Persons, with respect to the Transaction or otherwise,
(i) as to all communications among Seller's Counsel, the Company Entities,
Seller or any of its Affiliates, the attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product protection and the expectation of client confidence belongs solely to
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities), and may be
controlled by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities), and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Company Entities, or any of
their respective Affiliates, and (ii) Seller's Counsel may disclose to Seller
or its Affiliates any information learned by Seller's Counsel in the course of
its representation of Seller, the Company Entities or their respective
Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, or Seller's Counsel's duty of
confidentiality. Accordingly, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not have access
to any such communications, or to the files of Seller's Counsel, whether or
not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (i) to the extent that files of Seller's Counsel
constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates shall hold
such property rights, and (ii) Seller's Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to
Buyer or the Company Entities by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Seller's Counsel and the Company Entities or otherwise.

(c)If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) shall have the right to
assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Company Entities or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities), shall be
entitled to waive such privilege only with the consent of Seller.

Section 10.14 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Section 10.15 Dispute Resolution.

(a)In the event of any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection
with this Agreement (including any question regarding its existence, validity
or termination), the Parties shall first attempt in good faith amicably to
resolve such dispute. If such dispute remains unresolved thirty (30) days
following any written request by any Party to try in good faith to resolve it
amicably, such dispute shall be referred to and finally settled by
arbitration, in accordance with the current Rules of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC"). The place of the arbitration
shall be in Paris, France, and the arbitration shall be conducted in the
English language. The number of arbitrators shall be three (3), appointed as
follows:

(i) Each Party shall nominate one (1) arbitrator for appointment by the ICC,
and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall nominate the third arbitrator
(for appointment by the ICC) who shall act as presiding arbitrator of the
tribunal.

(ii) If either Party fails to nominate an arbitrator within thirty (30) days
of receiving a request for arbitration, such arbitrator shall be appointed by
the ICC.

(iii) If the two (2) arbitrators to be nominated by such Parties fail to agree
upon a third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the
second arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC.

(b)The arbitrators shall be empowered to award any type of relief, including
specific performance and consequential and punitive damages to the extent
available under this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrators shall be
final, binding, and enforceable upon the Parties, and such decision may be
entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction by either of the (c)In the event that the failure of a Party to comply with the decision of the
arbitrators gives rise to another Party's applying to any court for
enforcement of such award, the non-complying Party shall be liable to the
other for all costs of such proceeding including reasonable attorneys' fees,
expenses and disbursements. The costs of the arbitration, including
administrative and arbitrator's fees, shall be shared equally by the claimant
and respondent. Each party shall bear the costs of its own attorney's fees and
expert witness fees.

Section 10.16 Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. Each Party hereby agrees that the
execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement constitutes
private and commercial acts done for private and commercial purposes. As such,
each Party hereby consents to any relief and the issue of any process in any
proceeding related to this Agreement, including any proceeding to enforce or
execute upon a judgment or award arising out of or related to this Agreement;
and, in any proceeding related to this Agreement, each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead any immunity
that it, or its property or assets (irrespective of their use or intended
use), has or may hereafter acquire by virtue of its relationship with, or
possible congruence with, any sovereign or sovereign entity, or sovereign's
agents, representatives, employees or other individuals (such as immunity from
service of process, immunity from the jurisdiction of any court or immunity
from order or attachment of a court), including, for the avoidance of doubt,
prejudgment attachment. For the purposes of this provision, "assets" shall be
taken as excluding "premises of the mission" as defined in the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations signed at Vienna, April 18, 1961, "consular
premises" as defined in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations signed in
1963, and military property or military assets or property of such party.

Section 10.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 10.18 Currency Matters.

(a)All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Each Party's obligations
hereunder to make payments in Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by
any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in, or converted
into, any currency other than Dollars, except to the extent that such tender
or recovery results in the effective receipt by the respective party of the
full amount of Dollars expressed to be payable to such party under this
Agreement.

(b)Except as expressly set forth herein, in all cases where it is necessary
for the determination of any amount included in the calculation of the
Preliminary Purchase Price or the Final Purchase Price to determine or specify
an amount in Dollars where the underlying value of such amount is expressed in
a currency other than Dollars, such value shall be converted into Dollars at
the Exchange Rate.

Section 10.19 Disclosure Schedules. There may be included in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule items and information, the disclosure of which is not
required either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in
a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Article III or Article IV or to one or more covenants
contained in Article VI (other than Section 6.7). Inclusion of any items or
information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" or is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or
to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. The
Disclosure Schedules set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section and/or subsection of this Agreement to
which the items or information in such Disclosure Schedules relates; provided,
that any information set forth in one section or subsection pertaining to the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall be deemed to apply to
each other section or subsection thereof pertaining to representations,
warranties and covenants to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that it
is relevant to such other sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, provided that
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not apply to any covenants or
indemnification set forth in Section 6.7. Nothing in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall constitute an admission of any liability or obligation of any
Party to any third party, nor an admission to any third party against the
interests of any or all of the Parties.
