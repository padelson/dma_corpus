and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.   

 (c) Dividends. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared with a record date on or after the Effective Time on Parent Shares shall be paid with respect to any Shares represented by a Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares and not paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares, less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required thereon. The Surviving Corporation will provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent the cash necessary to make the payments contemplated by this Section 3.3(c).   

 (d) No Fractional Securities. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fraction of a Parent Share, cash adjustments will be paid to holders in respect of any fraction of a Parent Share that would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying such shareholders fraction of a Parent Share that would otherwise be issuable by the closing price per share of Parent Shares on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape on the Closing Date as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_  (or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source).

 (c) Each Benefit Plan listed on Item 4.12(a) of the Company Letter which is intended to be a Qualified Plan has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that such plan is so qualified under the Code (or an application for such letter has been or will be submitted to the IRS within the applicable remedial amendment period) or has been established pursuant to a prototype plan that has received a favorable opinion letter from the IRS, and no circumstance exists which, might cause such plan to cease being so qualified except for any circumstance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each Benefit Plan listed on Item 4.12(a) of the Company Letter complies and has been maintained in all respects with its terms and all requirements of law and regulations applicable thereto, and there has been no notice issued by any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging such compliance, except for any circumstance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan or Compensation Commitment, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of any plan defect which would qualify for correction under any such program, except for any action, filing or plan defect that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any pension plan or by any ERISA Affiliate of the Company within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (e) All contributions or premiums required to be paid under the terms of any Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, collective bargaining agreement or by any applicable laws as of the date hereof have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Filed SEC Documents. No Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Benefit Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

 (g) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, approval of this Agreement, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will: (i) entitle any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon termination of employment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans or Compensation Commitments, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of the Benefit Plans or Compensation    ##### 

  

    

Commitments, (iv) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Compensation
Commitments, (v) cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to record additional compensation expense on its income
statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other equity-based
award or (vi) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans or
Compensation Commitments that are not deductible pursuant to Section 162(m)
or Section 280G of the Code.   

 (h) All Benefit Plans and Compensation Commitments covering current or former employees employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries outside the United States, or their dependents or beneficiaries ("Company Non-US Compensation and Benefit Plans"), are and have been registered, qualified, invested and administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable local law and the terms of such Company Non-US Compensation and Benefit Plans. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all material obligations under such Company Non-US Compensation and Benefit Plans and there is no proceeding, action, complaint, investigation or claim in respect of any Company Non-US Compensation and Benefit Plan initiated by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (other than routine inquiries and claims for benefits that would not, individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company). Each Company Non-US Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a funded plan is fully funded as of the last actuarial valuation date on both a going concern and a solvency basis pursuant to the actuarial assumptions and methodology utilized in the most recent actuarial valuation therefor as filed with the applicable regulatory authorities, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company Non-US Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than pension plans) provide benefits to retired employees or to the beneficiaries or dependents of retired employees, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   

 (i) As a direct or indirect result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no payment or other benefit, and no acceleration of the vesting of any options, payments or other benefits, will be (or under Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder will be presumed to be) a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, without regard to whether such payment or acceleration is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the future.

Each Benefit Plan listed on Item 5.13(a) of the Parent Letter complies and has been maintained in all respects with its terms and all requirements of law and regulations applicable thereto, and there has been no notice issued by any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging such compliance, except for any circumstance that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

plans or otherwise to provide health or death benefits to or in respect of

applicable state law. No plan or arrangement disclosed on Item 5.13(c) of the
Parent Letter that provides health or death benefits to or in respect of
former employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries contains provisions
that by their terms prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries from amending or

 (d) Parent and its Subsidiaries have not, within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof, incurred and do not expect to incur any material withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent).

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it or its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal which constitutes or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any letter of intent or agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that if, at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal from any third Person that in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that it would be required to do so by its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may, in response to such Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to any such Person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no more favorable to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent and (y) participate in negotiations with such Person regarding such Superior Proposal if (A) prior to furnishing such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such third Person the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provides at least three business days advance written notice to Parent of the identity of the third Person making, and the proposed terms and conditions of, such Superior Proposal and a copy of all written materials delivered by such third Person to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the Company shall have provided to Parent a copy of all written materials delivered to the third Person making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal and made available to Parent all materials and information made available to the third Person making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal and (C) the Company shall have fully complied with this Section 6.2.

transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries,
other than the transactions with Parent contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited _bona
fide_ written offer made by any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates)

Company and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its
financial advisors) to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to
the Companys shareholders than the Merger (and any revised proposal made by
Parent), which is not conditioned on any financing and which is reasonably
likely to receive all required governmental approvals in the form of Final
Orders prior to the End Date and is otherwise reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed (taking into account the ability to deliver
any consideration to be paid in connection with such transaction).

 (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 9.1(d).   

 (d) The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it will notify Parent in writing as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 18 hours) after any Takeover Proposal is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations relating to a Takeover Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents. The notice shall indicate the name of the Person making such Takeover Proposal or taking such action, the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and a copy of all written materials delivered by such Person making the Takeover Proposal to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the    ##### 

  

  

status and materials terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of
any such discussions or negotiations and provide Parent with copies of
all written materials delivered by such Person making the Takeover Proposal
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company also agrees that it
will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with any Takeover Proposal to return
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person
by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce and shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any standstill or employee non-solicitation provision of any confidentiality, standstill, employee non-solicitation or similar agreement between the Company and any other Persons which relates to any transaction that could constitute a Takeover Proposal or that has as a counterparty any Person other than Parent. During such period, the Company agrees to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreements, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any threatened or actual breach of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and any provision thereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

Parent shall promptly advise the Company orally and in writing, to the Knowledge of Parent, if there exists a material breach of a representation or warranty made by Parent contained herein or if there occurs, to the Knowledge of Parent, any change or event which results in the executive officers of Parent having a good faith belief that such change or event has resulted in, or is reasonably likely to result in, a material breach of a representation or warranty made by Parent contained herein.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, employees or other representatives or agents to participate in any formal discussions or negotiations with any taxing authority related to the foregoing, unless, in each case, it consults with Parent in advance of such discussions or negotiations.   

 (c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, promptly notify the Company or Parent, as the case may be, of any written communication with or notice from any taxing authority relating to any    #####

 Section 6.5 Reorganization. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, unless the other party shall otherwise agree in writing, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall take or fail to take any action which action or failure would, to its Knowledge, jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   

 Section 6.6 Rate Matters. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, deliver to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, a copy of each principal filing or agreement related to its generally applicable rates, charges, standards of service, accounting or regulatory policy which could lead to a material change in any of those areas as soon as practicable and in any event no later than five business days prior to the filing or execution thereof so that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, may comment thereon.

Restrictions which applied to such Company Stock-Based Award or Company Cash
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any

Section 9.1(e)) recommend to its shareholders that the Company Shareholder
Approval be given. Subject to the remainder of this Section 7.3(a), Parent
shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that the
Parent Shareholder Approval be given. Parent shall not withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to the

Issuance, the Merger and this Agreement or the recommendation by such Board
of Directors of the Parent Share Issuance or such Board of Directors

in the best interest of, Parent and its shareholders except to the extent the
Board of Directors of Parent determines in its reasonable good faith judgment
that the making of, or the failure to withdraw, qualify or modify such

forth in the preceding sentence at any time after the Parent Shareholders
Meeting.    

 (b) The Company and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement which will include the Proxy Statement as a prospectus.

were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of
Parent and the Company.

after consultation with the Chairperson of the Transition Team, the taking of

the Transition Chairperson, together with at least one dissenting Transition
Team member, shall consult with the Chief Executive Officer of each of Parent

In addition, from and after the Effective Time, Indemnified Persons who become directors, officers, employees or fiduciaries under benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to the indemnity rights and protections afforded to directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries under benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event that any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this Section 7.9 after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to the providing by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto.

Item 7.9 of the Company Letter sets forth the Current Premium.   

 (c) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and the Company.

 (f) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in Sections 9.2(b) through (e) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent or the Company, as applicable, would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as applicable, fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 9.2(b), (c), (d) or (e), as the case may be, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as applicable, for any of the amounts set forth in Section 9.2(b), (c), (d) or (e), as the case may be, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, as applicable, its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit. Interest shall accrue on any amounts due under Section 9.2(b), (c), (d) or (e) from and after 30 days of the date such amount is due at the prime rate of J.P. Morgan Chase, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   

 Section 9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, but if (i) the Company Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained, thereafter no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by the Companys shareholders without obtaining such further approval or (ii) the Parent Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained, thereafter no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by Parents shareholders without obtaining such further approval.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.    #####

To be properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given in accordance with Section 2.03 of these bylaws or (ii) otherwise brought before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of a majority of the total number of directors that the corporation would have if there were no vacancies on the board of directors (the "Whole Board").

officer determines that any business is not properly brought before such
meeting, he or she will so declare to the meeting and any such business will
not be conducted or considered.

 Section 7.01 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent permitted or required by the Business Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 7.03 of this Article VII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation.    ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.02 Right to Advancement of Expenses. The right to indemnification conferred in Section 7.01 of this Article VII shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Business Corporation Law so requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 7.02 or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. Any repeal, amendment or modification hereof shall be prospective only and shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing. Each person who shall act as an indemnitee of the corporation shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon the rights provided by this Article.

If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Business Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Business Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or shareholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by    ##### 

  

  

the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII
or otherwise shall be on the corporation.    

 Section 7.04 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the articles, these bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.   

 Section 7.05 Insurance. The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Business Corporation Law.   

 Section 7.06 Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation.

EXHIBIT B  

FORM OF COMPANY AFFILIATE LETTER    

 , 200    

Exelon Corporation 
 10 S. Dearborn St. 
 Chicago, Illinois 60603   

Ladies and Gentlemen:   

 I have been advised that, as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"), as such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").   

 Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 20, 2004 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), between the Company and Exelon Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"), the Company will be merged with and into Parent (the "Merger"). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.   

 I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger Agreement is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company, my ability to sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares that I receive in exchange for any shares of Common Stock, no par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale, assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such Parent Shares of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act.   

 I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will not sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) by a sale made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 (and otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of Parent and if so required at the time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of Parent Shares pursuant to Rule 145, I will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of customary sellers and brokers Rule 145 representation letters or as Parent may otherwise reasonably request.    ##### 

  

  

 I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of Parent Shares by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as a result of the Merger.   

 I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on certificates representing Parent Shares delivered to me or held by a transferee thereof, which legends will be removed (i) by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of a letter from the Staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legends are no longer required for the purposes of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or (ii) in the event of a sale of Parent Shares which has been registered under the Securities Act or made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145.   

 I further understand and agree that Parent may instruct the registrar for the Parent Shares not to register the transfer of any Parent Shares held by me unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement.   

 Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.   

 This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania applicable to contracts to be performed wholly in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   

 If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to the undersigned, at which time this letter shall become a binding agreement between us.
