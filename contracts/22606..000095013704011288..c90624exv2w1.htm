the shareholder provides the corporation with a current address, the
corporation shall recommence sending notices and other communications to the
shareholder in the manner provided by these bylaws.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.05 Action by Shareholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;General Rule. Except as otherwise provided in the Business Corporation
Law or the articles or these bylaws, whenever any corporate action is to be
taken by vote of the shareholders of the corporation, it shall be authorized
upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all
shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to
vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class, in each case at
a duly organized meeting of shareholders. Except as otherwise provided in the
terms of the Preferred Stock or when acting by unanimous consent to remove a
director or directors, the shareholders of the corporation may act only at a
duly organized meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Conduct of Business. Only such business will be conducted at an annual
or special meeting of shareholders as shall have been properly brought before

forth in this Section.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by
a shareholder, the shareholder must have given to the secretary of the
corporation timely written notice of the shareholder&#146;s intention to make
a proposal, in the manner and form prescribed herein.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To be timely, a shareholder&#146;s notice with respect to an

of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the
corporation and received by the secretary not less than 120
calendar days in advance of the first anniversary of the date on
which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials to
shareholders for the prior year&#146;s annual meeting of shareholders,
and this notice requirement shall not be affected by any
adjournment of said meeting; provided, however, that in the event

public announcement is first made of the date of the annual

<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A shareholder&#146;s notice to the secretary must set forth as
to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (A)&nbsp;a description in reasonable detail of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for
conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B)&nbsp;the name and
address, as they appear on the corporation&#146;s books, of the
shareholder proposing such business and of the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (C)&nbsp;the class and number
of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of
record by the shareholder proposing such business and by the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, and
(D)&nbsp;any material interest of such shareholder proposing such
business and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made in such business.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these
bylaws, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange
Act&#148;) and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section. For purposes of this Section,
&#147;public announcement&#148; means disclosure in a press release reported
by the Dow Jones News Service, Bloomberg Business News, or Reuters
Economic Services or in a document publicly filed by the
corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Section&nbsp;13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or publicly filed by
the corporation with any national securities exchange or quotation
service through which the corporation&#146;s stock is listed or traded,
or furnished by the corporation to its shareholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of the date of the annual
meeting is required for the advance notice provision of this
Section&nbsp;3.05 (b)&nbsp;to be effective if the annual meeting is held on
such date as specified in Section&nbsp;3.02 of these bylaws. Nothing in
this Section will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to
request inclusion of proposals in the corporation&#146;s proxy statement
pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14a-8 under the Exchange Act.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be
conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i)&nbsp;specified

accordance with Section&nbsp;2.03 of these bylaws or (ii)&nbsp;otherwise brought
before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of
a majority of the total number of directors that the corporation would
have if there were no vacancies on the board of directors (the &#147;Whole
Board&#148;).

corporation designated by a majority of the Whole Board, will call meetings of
shareholders to order or, in the case of vacancy in office and absence of
action of the Whole Board, one of the following officers present in the order
stated: The president, if there be one, the vice presidents in their order of
rank and seniority shall act as &#147;presiding officer&#148; of the meeting. The term
&#147;presiding officer&#148; means an officer who presides over a meeting of
shareholders. The secretary or, in the absence of the secretary, an assistant
secretary, or, in the absence of both the secretary and assistant secretaries,
a person appointed by the presiding officer of the meeting, shall act as
secretary of the meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Rules of Conduct. Unless otherwise determined by the board of
directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of
shareholders will determine the order of business and have the authority to
make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as
such presiding officer deems necessary, appropriate or convenient for the
proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an
agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations
on participation in such meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation

shareholders need not be conducted in accordance with rules of parliamentary
procedure.

shareholders by a proxy of a shareholder shall constitute the presence
of, or vote or action by, the shareholder.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where two or more proxies of a shareholder are present, the
corporation shall, unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy,
accept as the vote of all shares represented thereby the vote cast by a
majority of them and, if a majority of the proxies cannot agree whether
the shares represented shall be voted, or upon the manner of voting the shares, the voting of the shares shall be divided equally among those
persons.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Form of Proxy. Every proxy shall be in a form approved by the
secretary of the corporation or as otherwise provided by the Business
Corporation Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Revocation. A proxy, unless coupled with an interest, shall be
revocable at will, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the
proxy to the contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective
until written notice thereof has been given to the secretary of the
corporation. An unrevoked proxy shall not be valid after three years from the
date of its execution unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. A
proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless,
before the vote is counted or the authority is exercised, written notice of the
death or incapacity is given to the secretary of the corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Expenses. The corporation shall pay the reasonable expenses of
solicitation of votes or proxies of shareholders by or on behalf of the board
of directors or its nominees for election to the board, including solicitation
by professional proxy solicitors and otherwise.

standing in the name of a trustee or other fiduciary and shares held by an
assignee for the benefit of creditors or by a receiver may be voted by the
trustee, fiduciary, assignee or receiver. A shareholder whose shares are
pledged shall be entitled to vote the shares until the shares have been
transferred into the name of the pledgee, or a nominee of the pledgee, but
nothing in this Section shall affect the validity of a proxy given to a pledgee
or nominee.

appointing them or of an order of court directing the voting of the shares, the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Voting by Corporate Shareholders. Any domestic or foreign corporation
for profit or not-for-profit that is a shareholder of this corporation may vote
at meetings of shareholders of this corporation by any of its officers or
agents, or by proxy appointed by any officer or agent, unless some other
person, by resolution of the board of directors of the other corporation or a
provision of its articles or bylaws, a copy of which resolution or provision
certified to be correct by one of its officers has been filed with the
secretary of this corporation, is appointed its general or special proxy in
which case that person shall be entitled to vote the shares.

the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, the meeting, which time,
except as otherwise provided in the articles or in the case of an adjourned
meeting, shall be not more than 90 calendar days prior to the date of the
meeting of shareholders. Only shareholders of record on the date fixed shall be
so entitled notwithstanding any transfer of shares on the books of the

board of directors may similarly fix a record date for the determination of
shareholders of record for any other purpose, except that the record date fixed
to determine the holders of Preferred Stock entitled to receive dividends
thereon shall not precede the respective dividend payment date by more than 40
calendar days. When a determination of shareholders of record has been made as
provided in this Section for purposes of a meeting, the determination shall

whereby a shareholder of the corporation may certify in writing to the
corporation that all or a portion of the shares registered in the name of the
shareholder are held for the account of a specified person or persons. Upon

kept in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall be prima facie evidence as to

Parent (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant to the
Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that
since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger
Agreement is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company, my ability
to sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares that I receive in exchange for
any shares of Common Stock, no par value per share, of the Company (&#147;Company
Common Stock&#148;) pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale,
assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are
limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions
of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to
the sale of such Parent Shares of Rules&nbsp;144 and 145(d) promulgated under the
Securities Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will not
sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares except (i)&nbsp;pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;by a sale made in
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule&nbsp;145 (and otherwise in
accordance with Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of
Parent and if so required at the time) or (iii)&nbsp;in a transaction which, in the
opinion of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as
described in a &#147;no-action&#148; or interpretive letter from the Staff of the
Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be registered
under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of Parent Shares pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;145, I will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in
the form of customary seller&#146;s and broker&#146;s Rule&nbsp;145 representation letters or
as Parent may otherwise reasonably request.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition of Parent Shares by me or on my
behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order
to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as
a result of the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on
certificates representing Parent Shares delivered to me or held by a transferee
thereof, which legends will be removed (i)&nbsp;by delivery of substitute
certificates upon receipt of a letter from the Staff of the Commission, or an
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
the effect that such legends are no longer required for the purposes of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or (ii)&nbsp;in the event of
a sale of Parent Shares which has been registered under the Securities Act or
made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further understand and agree that Parent may instruct the registrar for
the Parent Shares not to register the transfer of any Parent Shares held by me
unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement.

that I am an &#147;affiliate&#148; of the Company as described in the first paragraph of
this letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim
that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Parent and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement
shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws
