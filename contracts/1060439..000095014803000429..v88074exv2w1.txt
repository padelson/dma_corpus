and shares of Parent Common Stock, in the case of the Stock Consideration, into

obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current (or former) employee,

                           (d) Section 3.18(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list (by name and version number) of
all material service offerings, Computer Software and other products or services
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary currently sold, licensed, distributed
or otherwise provided by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (all of the
foregoing, collectively, "Company Products").

                           (e) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has done, or failed to do, any act or thing
which may, after the Closing

                                       11
<PAGE>
Date, prejudice the validity or enforceability of any material Company
Registered Intellectual Property in any material respect.

                           (f) Either the Company or a Company Subsidiary is the
sole and exclusive owner of all material Company Intellectual Property except as
to Intellectual Property that is co-owned by the Company and any Company
Subsidiary; provided, however, that as to any Intellectual Property that is
co-owned by the Company and one or more Company Subsidiaries, the Acquired
Assets will include the ownership rights of the Company and all co-owner Company
Subsidiaries.

                           (g) To the Knowledge of the Company, either the
Company or a Company Subsidiary owns or otherwise has the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary to: (i) provide the services currently provided
by the Company to third parties; (ii) use, manufacture, copy, modify, market and
distribute the products currently manufactured, marketed, sold, licensed or
otherwise distributed by the Company; and (iii) operate the internal systems of
the Company that are material to its business or operations, taken as a whole,
including, without limitation, computer hardware systems and software
applications. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably lead it to believe that the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries do not own or otherwise have the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary to: (i) provide the services currently provided
by the Company to third parties; (ii) use, manufacture, copy, modify, market and
distribute the products currently manufactured, marketed, sold, licensed or
otherwise distributed by the Company; and (iii) operate the internal systems of
the Company that are material to its business or operations, taken as a whole,
including, without limitation, computer hardware systems and software
applications. Each material item of such Intellectual Property shall be owned,
available for use or enforceable, as the case may be, by Parent immediately
following the Closing on substantially identical terms and conditions as it was
available to or enforceable by, as the case may be, the Company immediately
prior to the Closing.

                           (h) To the Knowledge of the Company, the activities
and the conduct of the business and operations of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary did not prior to Closing, and will not when conducted in the same
manner following the Closing, infringe upon, violate or constitute the
unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably lead it to believe that the activities or the conduct of the business
or operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary did prior to Closing, or
will when conducted in the same manner following the Closing, infringe upon,
violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights
of any third party. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened (in writing) claim before any court, agency, arbitral tribunal, or
registration authority in any jurisdiction: (i) involving any item of
Intellectual Property owned or used by the Company; (ii) alleging that the
activities or the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries does or will infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized
use of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party; or (iii) challenging
the ownership, use, validity, enforceability or registrability of any
Intellectual Property by the Company. There are no settlements, forbearances to
sue, consents, judgments, or orders or similar obligations (other than license
agreements in the ordinary course of business) which (A) restrict the rights of
the

                                       12
<PAGE>
Company to use any material Intellectual Property; (B) restrict the Company's
business in order to accommodate a third party's intellectual property rights;
or (C) permit third parties to use any material Intellectual Property owned by
the Company.

                           (i) [reserved]

                           (j) No third party possesses any copy of any source
code to any material Computer Software of the Company, except as permitted under
a License set forth in Section 3.18(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                           (k) No Computer Software that is open source, public
source or freeware, or any modification or derivative thereof, including any
version of any Computer Software licensed pursuant to any GNU general public
license or limited general public license was or is used in, incorporated into,
integrated or bundled with any material Company Product.

                           (l) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions to protect
each item of material Intellectual Property owned by them, except where the
failure to take such actions was the result of a reasonable business decision by
the Company made in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of the
Company, without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions to protect their
respective material Trade Secrets and any material Trade Secrets of third
parties provided to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary implements and enforces a policy requiring all employees,
contractors and other parties having access to such Trade Secrets to execute a
proprietary information/confidentiality agreement, in substantially the form
provided to Parent, with the Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries, as the
case may be. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no disclosure by
the Company or by the Company Subsidiaries of any such Trade Secrets except
pursuant to such proprietary information/confidentiality agreements, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no party to any such agreement is in breach thereof.

                           (m) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
in violation of any agreement relating to any Company Intellectual Property or
any third party Intellectual Property, except for such violations as have not
resulted, and could not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the
aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the consummation of the Transactions will not result in Parent being
bound by any non-compete or other restriction on the operation of any business
of Parent prior to the Closing or the granting by Parent of any rights or
licenses to any Intellectual Property rights of Parent prior to the Closing to a
third party (including but not limited to a covenant not to sue)

                           (n) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has disclosed the source code for any of the
Computer Software owned by them or other confidential information constituting,
embodied in or pertaining to such Computer Software to any Person, except
pursuant to effective nondisclosure agreements, and the Company has taken
commercially reasonable measures to prevent disclosure of such source code.

information and user information gathered or accessed in the course of the
operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have at all times complied in all respects with all rules,
policies and procedures established by the Company or any Company Subsidiary

Subsidiary; and (iii) no claims have been asserted or threatened against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (and to the Knowledge of the Company, no such
claims are likely to be asserted or threatened against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) by any Person alleging a violation of such Person's privacy,
personal or confidentiality rights under any such rules, policies or procedures.
With respect to all personal and user information described in this Section
3.18(o), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have at all times taken all
steps reasonably necessary (including, without limitation, implementing and
monitoring compliance with adequate measures with respect to technical and
physical security) to ensure that the information is protected against loss and
against unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or other misuse. To
the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no unauthorized access to or other
misuse of that information. To the Knowledge of the Company, the consummation of
the Transactions will not result in any breach or violation of any of the
Company's or any of its subsidiaries procedures, policies or rules governing
privacy or use of any information or data of, or with respect to, any Person or
violate any Law with respect to such data or information.

                  Section 3.19  Labor Matters.

and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated on behalf of the

                           (c) Since January 1, 2001, (i) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has effected a "plant closing" (as defined in the

Stockholder simultaneously with the execution hereof, Parent represents and
warrants to the Company, Aurora and Principal Stockholder that all of the
statements contained in this Article V are true and correct. For purposes of the
representations and warranties of Parent contained herein, disclosure in any

further inquiry would reasonably reveal that such disclosure applies to such
other representations and warranties. The inclusion of any information in any
section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule or other document delivered by Parent
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of

                  Section 5.6  Parent SEC Reports. Parent has filed all required
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and other information incorporated therein) with the SEC since December 31, 2000
through the date hereof (collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"). As of their
respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment,
each Parent SEC Report, (a) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports and (b) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference
into the Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent

                                       20
<PAGE>
and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent SEC Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows, as the case may be, of Parent and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein. There is no investigation by
the SEC threatened or pending, or, to the knowledge of the Parent, contemplated
with respect to any Parent SEC Report, including, without limitation, revenue
recognition thereunder or any of Parent's officers, directors or principal
stockholders.

                  Section 5.7  No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for (a)
liabilities and obligations disclosed in Parent's quarterly report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 filed with the SEC, incurred in the
ordinary course of business since September 30, 2002, (b) liabilities arising
out of facts or events fully disclosed in a press release issued by Parent
subsequent to that date and prior to the date hereof, and (c) liabilities that
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, has any
liabilities or obligations, that would be required to be disclosed in a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent (including the related notes thereto, where
appropriate) prepared in accordance with GAAP.

                  Section 5.8  Absence of Certain Changes. Except as (a)
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, (b) disclosed in Parent's quarterly report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 filed with the SEC, (c)
fully disclosed in a press release issued by Parent subsequent to that date and
prior to the date hereof, or (d) expressly required by this Agreement, since
September 30, 2002 to the Parent's knowledge, no event that would be reasonably
likely to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

                  Section 5.9  Parent Material Contracts. To Parent's knowledge,
Parent has not breached, or received in writing any claim or notice that it has
breached, any of the terms or conditions of (i) any agreement, contract or
commitment required to be filed as an exhibit to the Parent SEC Reports
(including any agreements, contracts or commitments entered into since September
30, 2002 that are required to be filed by Parent with the SEC in any report in
the future), or (ii) any agreement with any of the parties listed on Section 5.9
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the "Parent Material Contracts"). Each Parent
Material Contract that has not expired by its terms is in full force and effect
and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against
them in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in
equity), except where the failure of such Parent Material Contract to be in full
force and effect or to be legal, valid, binding or enforceable against Parent
has not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  Section 5.10  Availability of Funds. Parent currently has
access to sufficient immediately available funds in cash or cash equivalents,
and shall at the Closing have sufficient

                                       21

this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions including, but not limited to,
the Cash Consideration.

                  Section 5.11  Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement,
there is no action, suit, inquiry, proceeding or investigation by or before any
court or Governmental Entity pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, overtly
threatened against or involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or that questions or
challenges the validity of this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the Transactions.

                  Section 5.12  Investigation by Parent. Parent has conducted
its own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
software, technology and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
which investigation, review and analysis was done by Parent and, to the extent
Parent deemed appropriate, by Parent's representatives. Parent acknowledges that
it and its representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
such purpose. In entering into this Agreement, Parent acknowledges that it has
relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and,
except and only to the extent expressly set forth in Articles III and IV, not on
any factual representations or opinions of the Company or the Company's
representatives, and, in each case, Parent:

                           (a) acknowledges that, except and only to the extent
expressly set forth in Articles III and IV, none of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Principal Stockholder or any of their respective directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, agents,
advisors or representatives makes or has made any oral or written representation
or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of

room, in presentations by the Company's management or otherwise) provided or
made available to the Parent or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
controlling persons, agents or representatives;

                           (b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
that none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Principal Stockholder or any
of their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, Affiliates,
controlling persons, agents, advisors or representatives shall have any
liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent or its directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, agents or representatives on any
basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or
otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or statements
made (including in materials furnished in the Company's data room, in
presentations by the Company's management or otherwise), to Parent or its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons, advisors,
agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom); and

                           (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that, except to the
extent specifically set forth in this Article V, Parent is purchasing the
Acquired Assets on an "as-is, where-is" basis.

                  Section 5.13  Brokers or Finders. Neither Parent, nor any of
its Subsidiaries or its Affiliates has entered into any Contract entitling any
agent, broker, investment banker,

                                       22

Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the

herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to Parent if such
disclosure would, in its sole and absolute discretion (A) jeopardize any

fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which it or its Affiliates
is a party).

prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing, shall permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of
the other party in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making
or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of
any party in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection

exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel)
with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any
oral presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions; provided, that with respect
to any such filing, presentation or submission, each of the parties need not
supply the other party (or its counsel) with copies (or, in the case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Law applicable to such party
requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information.

                           (c) Notification. The Company, Principal Stockholder
and Parent each shall notify the other promptly upon its receipt of: (i) any

<PAGE>
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant to this
Agreement; and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for
amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information
provided to comply in all material respects with, any Laws. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to Section 6.3(a), each of the parties, as the case may be,
shall promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

                           (d) Efforts and Actions to Cause Closing to Occur.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, Principal Stockholder and Parent each shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or

necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity; (iii) the obtaining of all Necessary Consents; (iv) the
resolution of such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the

the contrary set forth in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate,
instrument or other document delivered in connection with the Transactions,
nothing in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate, instrument or other
document delivered in connection with the Transactions shall be deemed to
require Parent, the Company or Principal Stockholder, or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof, to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its
Affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or

effective as of the Closing Date to any of the employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary on terms and conditions, including provision of salary and
benefits, which are comparable to, in the aggregate, similarly situated

employment (the "Retained Employees"). The Company shall cooperate with Parent's
reasonable requests for access to the employees of the Company and each Company

all Benefit Plans set forth on Schedule 7.4(b) hereto and the parties shall
cooperate in obtaining such consent, as may be necessary, to effect such
transfer of sponsorship. With respect to such Benefit Plans and all other
employee benefits provided to the Retained Employees by Parent (i) service
accrued by each Retained Employee during employment with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date shall be recognized for all
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits (except with
respect to the provision of options or other equity compensation awards or to
the extent necessary to prevent duplication of benefits) and (ii) all
pre-existing condition limitations shall be waived to the same extent waived
under the Benefit Plans or, if more favorable to such Retained Employee, the
applicable plan of Parent. If reasonably requested by Parent, the Company agrees
to provide Parent with sufficient information and otherwise cooperate with
Parent so that it may satisfy its obligations under this Section 7.4(b).

                           (c) Severance and WARN Obligations. At the Closing,
Parent shall pay to the Company or on the Company's behalf (upon receipt of a
release, except where payment is required under the WARN Act) severance pay and
related benefits to employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who are
not offered employment with Parent and who do not become Retained Employees (the
"Non-Retained Employees"), in accordance with (i) applicable law, (ii) any
agreements giving rise to severance payments, and (iii) the Company's severance
policy set forth on Schedule 7.4(b). Parent shall reimburse the Company for all
costs, including wages and benefits, associated with employing the Non-Retained
Employees for the required period after the issuance of notices specified under
the WARN Act or any similar state, local or foreign statute, regulation or, with
respect to foreign employees, common-law requirement, or providing pay in lieu
of any such notice; provided, however, that the Company and any Company
Subsidiaries shall issue all such required notices no later than the Closing.

anniversary of the Closing Date,

                                       33

take any other action which is intended to induce or encourage, or has the
effect of inducing of encouraging, any Retained Employee to terminate his or her
employment therewith.

Report on Form 10-K for the year 2002, the information required to be disclosed
pursuant to Part III thereof without incorporating such information by reference
from the corresponding Proxy Statement pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange

                                   TERMINATION

                  Section 9.1  Termination. This Agreement may be terminated or
the Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

                           (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent,
Principal Stockholder and the Company; or

                           (b) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action which permanently restrains,
enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Transactions and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and non-appealable; or

                           (c) if the Transactions shall not have been
consummated by May 1, 2003 (the "End Date"); provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) shall not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause
of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;
or

                           (d) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or Principal
Stockholder set forth in this Agreement or if

                                       37
<PAGE>
any representation or warranty of the Company or Principal Stockholder shall
have become untrue, in either case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become
untrue; provided, that if such inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
of the Company or Principal Stockholder or breach by the Company or Principal
Stockholder is curable by the Company or Principal Stockholder prior to the End
Date through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent
may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) prior to forty-five
(45) days following receipt of written notice by the Company and Principal
Stockholder from Parent of such breach, so long as the Company and Principal
Stockholder continue to exercise their commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such breach through such forty-five (45) day period (it being understood that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if it
shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the Company
or Principal Stockholder is cured within such forty-five (45) day period); or

                           (e) by the Company or Principal Stockholder, upon a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Parent set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of
Parent shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set
forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) would not be satisfied as of the time
of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue; provided, that if such inaccuracy in Parent's representations and
warranties or breach by Parent is curable by Parent prior to the End Date
through the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then neither the
Company nor Principal Stockholder may terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(e) prior to forty-five (45) days following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Company or Principal Stockholder of such breach, so long
as Parent continues to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach through such forty-five (45) day period (it being understood that neither
the Company nor Principal Stockholder may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if
such breach by Parent is cured within such forty-five (45) day period); or

                           (f) by Parent, if a Company Material Adverse Effect
shall have occurred and be continuing as of the End Date; or

                           (g) by the Company, if a Parent Material Adverse
Effect shall have occurred and be continuing as of the End Date; or

                           (h) by Parent, if the Company shall have materially
and intentionally breached the terms of Section 7.1;

provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in
the event that the subsequent delivery of the Audited Financial Statements
results in or implies a breach of the representations or warranties set forth in
Section 3.6 such that the condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) would not be
satisfied, Parent's sole remedy shall be to either (i) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(d) above or (ii) irrevocably waive the breach relating
to, and any claim resulting from, a breach of Section 3.6 that Parent may have
for damages, indemnity or otherwise pursuant to Article XI or otherwise under
this Agreement.

                  Section 9.2  Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement or abandonment of the Transactions by either the
Company, Principal Stockholder or Parent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
non-terminating party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination of this Agreement or abandonment of the Transactions is
made, and there shall be no liability or obligation thereafter on the part of
any party hereto except for fraud or for willful breach of this Agreement prior
to such termination of this Agreement or abandonment of the Transactions. Prior
to the Closing Date, termination shall be Parent's sole remedy for breach of any
provision of this Agreement by the Company or the Principal Stockholder, other
than for willful and intentional breaches of this Agreement or breaches arising
out of fraud.

                  Section 10.1  Liability for Taxes.

                           (a) The Company and Principal Stockholder shall be
responsible for, pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Parent and each of
its Affiliates (including the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date)
(collectively, the "Parent Tax Indemnitees") and hold each Parent Tax Indemnitee
harmless from and against any liability for (i) Taxes of the Company for any
Taxable period other than Transfer Taxes for which Parent is responsible under
Section 10.5 of this Agreement, (ii) Taxes of each of the Company Subsidiaries
for any taxable period (or portion thereof, as determined pursuant to Section
10.2(c)) that ends on or prior to the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Period")
other than Transfer Taxes for which Parent is responsible under Section 10.5 of
this Agreement and (iii) Taxes imposed on any consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been a member;
provided, however, that the Company and Principal Stockholders shall not
indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Tax Indemnitees from any liability for
Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period to the extent of reserves for Taxes (other than
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) if any, set forth on the Balance Sheet. Principal
Stockholder shall be entitled to any Tax Refunds to the extent that such Tax
Refunds relate to a Tax liability that is the responsibility of the Company or
Principal Stockholder under this Section 10.1(a).

                           (b) Parent shall, except to the extent that such
Taxes are to be paid by the Company or Principal Stockholder under Section
10.1(a), be responsible for, pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify the
Company, Principal Stockholder and each of their Affiliates (other than the
Company Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Company Tax Indemnitees") and hold
each Company Tax Indemnitee harmless from and against all Taxes of, imposed upon
or relating to the Company Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company Subsidiaries
shall be entitled to any Tax Refunds of Taxes of the Company Subsidiaries except
for Tax Refunds to which Principal Stockholder may be entitled under Section
10.1(a).

                           (c) The covenants set forth in this Section 10.1 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Parent Tax Indemnitees and the Company Tax Indemnitees, as the case may be, and
their respective heirs and successors.

                  Section 10.2 Filing Responsibility.

                           (a) Principal Stockholder shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, when due: (i) all Tax Returns for any Principal
Stockholder Affiliated Group which includes the Company or any Company
Subsidiary; and (ii) any Tax Return of any Company or any Company Subsidiary
that includes a Pre-Closing Period and is due (giving effect to valid extensions
thereto) on or prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with past practices, consistently applied. With respect to any such
Tax Return, Parent shall pay Principal Stockholder any amount for which Parent
is responsible under Section 10.2(c) no later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the date such Tax Return is to be filed.

                           (b) Parent shall, except to the extent that filing
such Tax Returns are the responsibility of Principal Stockholder under Section
10.2(a), prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns
with respect to each Company Subsidiary. With respect to any such Tax Return,
Principal Stockholder shall pay Parent any amount for which Principal
Stockholder is responsible under Section 10.2(c) no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the date such Tax Return is to be filed.

                           (c) Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date and the portion of any such Taxes allocable to
the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to equal
(i) in the case of Taxes that (x) are based upon or related to income or
receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property, the amount which would be payable if the taxable year
ended with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. For purposes of the
provisions of Section 10.1, each portion of such period shall be deemed to be a
taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable period).

                  Section 10.3 Cooperation and Exchange of Information.

                           (a) After the Closing, Principal Stockholder and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to: (i) assist the
other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible
for preparing and filing in accordance with this Article X; (ii) cooperate fully
in preparing for and participating in any Audits of any Tax Returns relating in
whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Period; and (iii) make available to the
other party as reasonably requested all information, records, documents, copies
of appropriate notices, and forms or other communications received from or sent
to any Tax Authority which relate to the Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period; provided, however, that Principal
Stockholder shall have the sole authority to make all determinations with
respect to any Tax Returns relating to the Principal Stockholder Affiliated
Group, and with respect to other Tax Returns to the extent that determinations
with respect to such other Tax Returns may affect the amount of Taxes for which
the Company or Principal Stockholder is liable, or Tax Refunds to which
Principal Stockholder is entitled, under Section 10.1(a); provided, however,
that with respect to such other Tax Returns, Principal Stockholder shall be
required to obtain the consent of Parent before making any determination that
could reasonably

                                       40
<PAGE>
be expected to materially adversely affect Parent or any Company Subsidiary,
which consent should not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                           (b) For a period of time that is to continue until
sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation
(giving effect to valid extensions thereto), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, retain all Tax Returns, books and records of, or with
respect to the activities of each of the Company Subsidiaries for all
Pre-Closing Periods. Thereafter, Parent shall not, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary not to, dispose of any such Tax Returns, books or records unless it
first offers such Tax Returns, books and records to Principal Stockholder and
Principal Stockholder fails to accept such offer within ninety (90) days of its
being made.

                           (c) Parent shall promptly notify Principal
Stockholder upon receipt by Parent or any of its Affiliates of notice of any
claim, assessment or dispute relating to any Tax Proceeding which Principal
Stockholder is entitled to control under this Section 10.3(c) and shall promptly
forward to Principal Stockholder any communications received from or sent to any
Tax Authority in connection with any such Tax Proceeding; provided, however,
that failure to give such notice shall not affect Parent's right to
indemnification under this Article X except to the extent, if any, that but for
such failure, Principal Stockholder would have avoided all or a portion of the
Tax liability that is the subject of the Tax Proceeding. Principal Stockholder
shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and defend any Tax
Proceeding (i) with respect to Taxes of any Principal Stockholder Affiliated
Group that includes the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) which may
affect the amount of Taxes for which the Company or Principal Stockholder is
liable or responsible (or refunds or credits to which Principal Stockholder is
entitled) under Section 10.1(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any Tax Return for any Principal Stockholder
Affiliated Group which includes the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor shall
Parent, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates be
entitled to any information regarding any such Tax Return, except to the extent
relating solely to any Company Subsidiary.

                  Section 10.4 Tax Sharing Agreements. Anything in any other
agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all liabilities and obligations
between Principal Stockholder or any member of the Principal Stockholder
Affiliated Group, on the one hand, and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement in effect prior to
the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and terminate as of the
Closing Date.

                  Section 10.5 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Company shall be responsible for and shall pay the
first $3,000,000 of any documentary, sales, use, registration, value added,
transfer, stamp and similar Taxes, fees and costs (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes") incurred in connection with the Transactions, and Parent and Company
shall each be responsible for and shall pay 50% of any additional Transfer Taxes
above $3,000,0000 incurred in connection with the Transactions.

                  Section 10.6 Section 338 Election. The Company and Parent
agree that an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law, as applicable) shall not be made with respect to
the sale of the capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Agreement without the consent of the Principal Stockholder.

                  Section 10.7 Survival. All rights and obligations under this
Article X shall survive the Closing Date and continue until sixty (60) days
after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation (giving effect to
valid extensions thereto).

                  Section 10.8 Scope of Remedy. Any claims for indemnification
relating to Taxes shall be governed by the provisions of this Article X, except
that in addition to the indemnity provided herein (but without duplication),
Parent shall be entitled to make a claim against the Escrow Fund in accordance
with Article XI. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations on
indemnification set forth in Article XI shall apply to any claim for
indemnification relating to Taxes pursuant to Article X.

                  Section 10.9 Disputes. If a dispute arises as to the
determination of the amount of any liability for Taxes under this Article X and
no agreement regarding the rights of the respective parties can be reached after
good faith negotiation, the dispute shall promptly be resolved in accordance
with the following procedure: each party shall select a nationally recognized
accounting firm. Such two nationally recognized accounting firms shall then in
turn mutually select a separate nationally recognized accounting firm not then
acting as the principal outside accountant for Parent, Principal Stockholder,
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates who shall then be designated
as the "Accounting Referee." Parent and Principal Stockholder shall direct the
Accounting Referee to promptly review and make its final determination with
respect to the disputed items or amounts. The decision of the Accounting Referee
as to the validity and amount of any claim shall be binding and conclusive upon
Parent and Principal Stockholder. Parent, on the one hand, and Principal
Stockholder, on the other hand, shall each bear its/their own expenses
(including, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any such
dispute resolution. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be
borne equally by Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, out of the Escrow
Fund on the other hand.

                           ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION

                  Section 11.1 Escrow Fund. Within one (1) Business Day after
the Closing, the Company shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
escrow agent selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent (the
"Escrow Agent"), the Escrow Amount (together with any interest earned thereon or
dividends, distributions or other consideration paid therefor, the "Escrow
Fund"), which shall be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Parent or other
Parent Indemnified Parties for Damages pursuant to the indemnification
obligations of the Company and Principal Stockholder set forth in this Article
XI.

                  Section 11.2 Indemnification.

                           (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article XI, the Company and the Principal Stockholder shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, Parent's officers, directors, agents and employees, and each
person, if any, who controls or may control Parent within the meaning of the
Securities Act (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") from and against
any and all actual losses, costs, damages, liabilities, payments, obligations,
assessments, and expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of
action and choses in action, including, without limitation, reasonable legal
fees and expenses incurred in connection with defending any claim or actions and
all amounts paid in settlement of any claims or actions to which the Company has
given prior written consent (collectively, "Damages"), which have been paid,
suffered or incurred by such Parent Indemnified Parties as a result of or
arising out of: (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of the representations,
warranties or covenants made by the Company or Principal Stockholder in this
Agreement, the Company Officer's Certificate or Principal Stockholder Officer's
Certificate or (ii) any of the Excluded Liabilities.

                           (b) The right to obtain indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.2(a), subject to the limitations of Section 11.4, shall be the Parent
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any breach by the Company,
Aurora or the Principal Stockholder of the terms of this Agreement, or any other
claim or matter arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Article X and except for claims
arising from a breach based on fraud; provided, however, that, if the Closing
does not occur, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall have no right to
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Section 11.2(a) or otherwise
for the breach by the Company, Aurora or Principal Stockholder of the terms of
this Agreement other for than an intentional and willful breach of this
Agreement, or a breach based on fraud.

                           (c) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
receive indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than
for an intentional and willful breach of a covenant or a breach of the
representations and warranties in Sections 3.2, 3.25 or 4.2) unless and until
the Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a) (other than for an intentional and
willful breach of a covenant or a breach of the representations and warranties
in Sections 3.2, 3.25 or 4.2) exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in
the aggregate (the "Indemnity Basket"), in which

                                       43
<PAGE>
case the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the full amount
of such Damages, including the Indemnity Basket, up to the aggregate amount of
the Escrow Fund.

                           (d) The Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover the full amount of Damages up to the aggregate amount of the Escrow Fund
either: (i) if the Escrow Fund is comprised solely of cash at the time of
payment, in the form of cash; or (ii) if the Escrow Fund is comprised of both
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock at the time of payment, Damages shall be
paid in cash and by the cancellation of a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock based on the ratio of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock then
comprising the Escrow Fund where the value of the shares shall be determined by
dividing such amount of Damages allocated to the shares by the Average Closing
Price.

                           (e) The parties agree that there shall not be any
multiple recovery as between the Company and the Principal Stockholder for any
Damages pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Section 11.2.

                           (f) In calculating the amount of any indemnifiable
Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for an intentional and willful breach
of a covenant or a breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.2,
3.25 or 4.2), there shall be deducted the net present value of any actual Tax
benefit which Parent in good faith determines that can actually be realized by
Parent or a member of the Parent Affiliated Group in the taxable year which
includes the date the claim is to be paid, in any prior taxable year, or in the
next succeeding taxable year, net of any associated tax detriment (including tax
detriments associated with the receipt of such indemnification payments received
by Parent or members of the Parent Affiliated Group in respect of such Damages).
Parent's determination shall be made after taking into account all other items
of income and deduction of Parent and all members of Parent's affiliated group.

                           (g) Unless otherwise required by applicable law or
GAAP, the parties agree that the payment of any Damages will be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

                  Section 11.3 Termination. The indemnity obligations of the
Company and the Principal Stockholder set forth in Section 11.2(a)(i) with
respect to a breach of a covenant to be performed prior to Closing or a
representation and warranty of the Company or Principal Stockholder (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.25 and 4.2)
shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. California time on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Termination Date"); provided, however,
that claims for indemnification made against the Escrow Fund or otherwise prior
to the Termination Date shall survive the Termination Date until finally
resolved. Parent and the Company jointly shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate specifying the Closing Date.

                  Section 11.4 Claims upon Escrow Fund.

                           (a) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the
Termination Date of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an "Escrow
Officer's Certificate"):

                                    (i) stating that Damages exist in an
         aggregate amount greater than the Indemnity Basket for claims against
         the Escrow Fund, and

                                    (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the
         individual items included in the amount of Damages in such claim, the
         date each such item was paid, properly accrued or arose and the nature
         of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or claim to which such
         item is related,

the Escrow Agent shall set aside such number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
such amount of cash, or such combination thereof, as determined pursuant to
Section 11.2(d), having a value equal to the amount of such Damages.

                           (b) The Escrow Agent shall deliver such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, such amount of cash, or such combination thereof,
as determined pursuant to Section 11.2(d), having a value equal to the amount of
Damages claimed from the Escrow Fund to Parent as soon as practicable following
the earliest of: (i) receipt of written authorization from the Company to make
such delivery; (ii) receipt of written notice of a final decision or order of a
court of competent jurisdiction of the claim; or (iii) the close of business on
the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt by the Escrow Agent of an Escrow
Officer's Certificate to which the Company has not objected in accordance with
Section 11.5.

                           (c) The Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
source of recovery for the indemnity claims of the Parent Indemnified Parties
under Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for intentional and willful breach of
covenants or a breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.2,
3.24 or 4.2), subject to the provisions of Section 11.2(b).

                           (d) The Parent Indemnified Parties may not assert any
claim directly against the Company (as opposed to through recourse to the Escrow
Fund) or the Principal Stockholder unless and until it has reasonably determined
in good faith that the Escrow Fund shall not satisfy all then-existing and
unsatisfied claims. The Parent Indemnified Parties may not actually recover any
indemnification claims against the Principal Stockholder unless it also has
reasonably determined in good faith that the Escrow Fund and the resources of
the Company shall not satisfy all then-existing and unsatisfied claims.

                  Section 11.5 Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of
any Escrow Officer's Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such

equal to the Damages claimed from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section

basis therefor under the terms of this Agreement, and such statement shall have

any claim or claims by Parent made in any Escrow Officer's Certificate pursuant
to Section 11.5, Parent shall have twenty (20) days after receipt by the Escrow
Agent of an objection by the Company to respond in a written statement to the
objection of the Company. If after such twenty (20) day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Company and Parent shall attempt in good faith for
twenty (20) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect
to each of such claims. If the Company and Parent should so agree, a memorandum
setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and
shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely on any such memorandum and shall make payments from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.

respective parties can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or
the Company may seek to resolve such dispute or claim in a court of competent
jurisdiction or seek other legal or equitable resolution. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Parent Indemnified Party may at any time apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief in connection with a claim for
indemnification or otherwise to prevent irreparable harm.

becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent believes may result in a claim
for indemnification, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such claim, and
the Company shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in any defense of
such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any
claim; provided, however, that Parent may not effect the settlement of any such
claim (i) without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or (ii) for which indemnity beyond the Escrow Fund will be
sought. In the event that the Company has consented to any such settlement, the
Company shall have no power or authority to object under Section 11.5 or any
other provision of this Article XI to any claim by Parent against the Escrow
Fund for indemnity in the amount of such settlement.

                  Section 11.8 Tax Indemnification. Any claims for indemnity
relating to Taxes shall be governed by the provisions of Article X, except that
in addition to the indemnity provided therein (but without duplication), Parent
shall be entitled to make a claim against the Escrow Fund in accordance with
this Article XI. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations on
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI shall apply to any claim for
indemnification relating to Taxes pursuant to Article X.

agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.

                  Section 13.5  Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement (a)
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the

or remedies upon any Person other than the parties, the Parent Indemnified

to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions

giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; and (c)
agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in the
State of Delaware.

                  Section 13.9  Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the

in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or
on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

                  Section 13.10 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written content of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns. If Parent or any of its
successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (b) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary to effectuate the purpose of this Agreement, Parent (or any of
its successors and assigns) shall make proper provision so that the successors
and assigns of Parent shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
Agreement and none of the actions described in clauses (a) or (b) shall be taken
until such provision is made.

                  Section 13.11 Survival. The covenants to be performed prior
to the Closing set forth in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing and
shall terminate, and be of no further force or effect, upon the Closing. The
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing for the Escrow Period and shall thereafter terminate and be of no
further force or effect.

                  Section 13.12 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY. EACH OF PARENT, THE
COMPANY AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS
