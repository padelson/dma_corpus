cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to), to the extent permitted by Law, furnish
promptly to such Parent Representatives all information concerning its finances, operations,
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, and respond to such inquires as

such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in each case to the

Indemnified Parties for actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time than those

party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights,
and the failure to take any action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article&nbsp;IX, if such
termination is permitted pursuant thereto, shall not give rise to an inference that a party
entitled to so terminate this Agreement has waived its right to do so.
