AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 30, 2006, by and among Molex Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), MLX Acquisition Corp. Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and Woodhead Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") of the Company has, subject to the conditions of this Agreement, determined that each of the Offer and the Merger (each as defined below) is in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company and approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and such approval by the Board of the Offer and the Merger constituted the approvals required by Section 203(a)(1) of the DGCL and Articles Eleventh and Fourteenth of the Companys certificate of incorporation; and 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Purchaser shall make a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ "), at a price of $19.25 per Share (such amount, or any greater amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Per Share Amount_ "), net to the seller in cash, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board has unanimously approved the making of the Offer and resolved to recommend that holders of Shares tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent and Purchaser entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, the Company, is granting to Purchaser a Top-Up Option (as hereinafter defined) to purchase Shares in certain circumstances upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the definitions of certain capitalized terms used herein are set forth in Section 10.11 hereof. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE OFFER 

   

 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article IX and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex A hereto shall have occurred and be existing, Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any 

   ##### 

  

 

event within five Business Days) after the date hereof. The obligation of
Purchaser to commence the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto, and the obligation of Purchaser to accept for
payment, purchase and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Annex A
hereto and to the further condition that a number of Shares representing not
less than a majority of the Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted basis
shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
date of the Offer (the " _Minimum Condition_ " and together with the other
conditions set forth in Annex A, collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").
For purposes of this Agreement, "fully diluted basis" means issued and
outstanding Shares and Shares subject to issuance assuming the exercise of
all options, warrants, rights and convertible securities outstanding at the
time of acceptance for payment of the Shares in the Offer. Purchaser
expressly reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition, to increase the
Per Share Amount and to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of
the Offer; _provided_ , that unless previously approved by the Company in
writing, no change in the Offer may be made which (i) decreases the Per
Share Amount payable in the Offer, (ii) changes the form of consideration to
be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer or the Minimum Condition, (iv) imposes conditions to
the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex A hereto or which modifies
the conditions set forth in Annex A (other than to waive any such condition to
the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement), or (v) amends any other term
of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the Shares. Subject to the
terms of the Offer and this Agreement and to the prior satisfaction or waiver
by Parent or Purchaser of each of the Offer Conditions as of any expiration
date of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, pay
for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer. The Offer shall
initially be open for a period of twenty (20) consecutive Business Days
and shall initially be scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight, Eastern time,
immediately following the twentieth Business Day of such period (the "
_Initial Expiration Time_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Purchaser
may, in its sole discretion and without the consent of the Company,
(x) extend the Offer for one or more periods if, at the Initial Expiration
Time or subsequent expiration time related to an extension of the Offer, any
of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived; provided
that no such extension or extensions shall occur after the Termination Date;
(y) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or provision of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer, and/or (z) extend the Offer for an aggregate period
of not more than 10 Business Days beyond the latest expiration date that
would otherwise be permitted (but not after the Termination Date) under
clause (x) or (y) of this sentence if there shall not have been tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer at least 90% of the outstanding Shares or
if there has been a commencement of a war or other international or national
calamity (including terrorist activity) directly involving the United States
and (ii) if, as of the Initial Expiration Time or subsequent expiration time
related to an extension of the Offer, any of the events set forth in clauses
(a), (b) or (d) of Annex A shall have occurred and be continuing (a nd the
condition in Annex A with respect to the applicable clause shall not have
been waived by Purchaser) then, subject to the right of Parent and Purchaser
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Purchaser shall be
required to extend the Offer unless such conditions could not reasonably be
expected to be waived or satisfied by the Termination Date. In addition,
Purchaser may (and, if the Company so requests, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) provide a "subsequent offering period" in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and, if applicable and to the extent
permitted under such Rule 14d-11, extend such subsequent offering period. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC, pursuant to Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (" _Regulation M-A_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO will comply in all material respects with 

   ##### 

  

 

the applicable provisions of federal securities laws and will include the
summary term sheet required under Regulation M-A and, as exhibits, the offer
to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and the related letter of
transmittal (such Schedule TO and such documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent, Purchaser and the
Company each agree to promptly correct any information provided by them for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and to correct any
material omissions, and Purchaser further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its
counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer
Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give consideration to all the additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent
and Purchaser agree to provide to the Company and its counsel any comments or
other communications which Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt
thereof, and any responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses,
and Parent and Purchaser shall give consideration to all additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

   

 1.2 _Company Action_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents that the Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger (as defined in Section 2.1) and the Top-Up Option (as defined in Section 1.4) (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Shares; (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions (such approval and adoption having been made in accordance with the DGCL) and that such approval constitutes approval of this Agreement and the Transactions for purposes of (A) Section 203 of the DGCL, (B) Article Eleventh, paragraph (d)(i) of the Companys certificate of incorporation, and (C) Article Fourteenth, paragraph (b)(i) of the Companys certificate of incorporation; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares thereunder to Purchaser and approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation and approval of the Board described in the immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner adverse to Purchaser or Parent except as permitted by Section 7.2(c). The Company has been advised by its directors and executive officers that they intend to tender all Shares beneficially owned by them to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") containing, except as permitted by Section 7.2(c), the recommendation described in Section 1.2(a)(iii). The Schedule 14D-9 will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of federal securities laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser agrees to promptly correct any information provided by them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and to correct any material omissions, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given an opportunity to review and comment 

   ##### 

  

 

upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC, and the Company shall give consideration to all the additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel.
The Company shall provide to Parent, Purchaser and their counsel any comments
or other communications which the Company may receive from the SEC
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof, and any
responses thereto. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such responses, and the Company shall
give consideration to all additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel. 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish or cause the transfer agent for the Shares to furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with such additional information and assistance (including, without limitation, updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger and any other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates, associates, agents and advisors shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the Company all copies of, and any extracts from or summaries of, such information then in their possession. 

  

 1.3 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Promptly upon the purchase of and payment for any Shares by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the Offer (provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied), Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, on the Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Board (giving effect to the directors designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of Shares so accepted for payment bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; provided, however, that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company Board (as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the Common Shares of the Company). In furtherance of Parents rights under this Section 1.3, the Company shall, upon Parent or Purchasers request, use all reasonable efforts promptly either to increase the size of the Board or to secure the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be so elected to the Board, and shall take all actions available to the Company to cause Parents designees to be so elected. At such time, the Company shall also upon Parents request cause Persons designated by Parent (provided that any designees to the Audit Committee comply with the Audit Committee Requirements (as defined below)) to have appropriate (and not less than a majority so long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the Shares) representation on (i) each committee of the Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to stockholders (as part of the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise) the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected to the Board (provided that Purchaser shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be included with respect to Purchasers designees). The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which Purchaser, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a 

   ##### 

  

 

holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise. 

   

 (b) In the event that Parents designees are elected to the Board, until the Effective Time (as defined below), the Board shall have at least three directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company (the " _Original Directors_ ") and at least three Original Directors shall serve on the Audit Committee of the Board such that such Audit Committee complies with all requirements of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market applicable thereto (collectively, the " _Audit Committee Requirements_ "); provided that, in such event, if the number of Original Directors is reduced below three for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Original Directors (or Original Director, if there be only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate Persons who satisfy the Audit Committee Requirements to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Original Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Original Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three Persons (who shall not be officers or affiliates of the Company) to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders, affiliates or associates of Parent or Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Original Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parents designees are elected to the Board before the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Original Directors shall be required for the Company to (a) amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (b) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, or (c) take any other action by the Board under or in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 1.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one Share more than 90% of the then outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis and assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares), at a price per share equal to the Per Share Amount. 

  

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall become exercisable upon Purchasers acceptance for payment and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Purchase Date_ ") if Parent and Purchaser do not then own 90% of the then outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis). The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable in whole and not in part and may be exercised only once and only during the ten Business Day period after the Purchase Date; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable and shall terminate on the Purchase Date if (i) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares would require stockholder approval under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock; and,  _provided, further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the first to occur of (x) the Effective Time; (y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (z) 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the date that is ten Business Days after the Purchase Date.

The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

 

in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the
number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay
the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares by wire transfer of same day funds to a bank account designated by the
Company and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a
certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. 

   

 (d) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Company Common Stock which Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act. 

  

 (e) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may, at the Companys election, contain the following legend: "The Shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or any exemption therefrom."

 4.3 _Merger Without Stockholders  Meeting_. Notwithstanding Section 4.2, if the Parent Companies shall acquire or otherwise own, in the aggregate, Shares entitled to at least 90% of the votes entitled to be cast on the Merger (including any Shares acquired pursuant to Section 1.4), the parties hereto agree, subject to satisfaction or (to the extent permitted hereunder) waiver of all conditions to the Merger, to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to be effective as soon as practicable after the acceptance for payment and purchase of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer without the Stockholders Meeting, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

  

 4.4 _Payment for Shares in the Merger_. The manner of making payment for Shares in the Merger shall be as follows: 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares, the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by Section 4.1(a) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; provided that such investments shall be limited to direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, commercial paper rated of the highest quality by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank having at least $1 billion in assets. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares. 

  

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record (other than holders of certificates for Shares referred to in Section 4.1(b)) of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
payment therefor. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and any
other required documents, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled
to receive for each of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, less any required
withholding of Taxes, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name a Certificate so surrendered is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable. In the event any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the Merger Consideration in
respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. Until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.4(b), each Certificate
(other than Certificates formerly representing Shares referred to in Section
4.1(b)) shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive, for each
Share formerly represented thereby, the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, less any required withholding of taxes. 

   

 (c) At any time following the date that is nine months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 

  

 4.5 _Transfer of Shares After the Effective Time_. No transfers of Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company after the close of business on the day prior to the date of the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article IV, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

  

 4.6 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 4.1(a) unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. A holder of 

   ##### 

  

 

Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares held by him or her in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall
be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, without
interest or dividends thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in the conduct of all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for appraisal. 

  

 4.7 _Stock Options_. 

  

 (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) terminate the Companys 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001 Stock Awards Plans or any predecessor plans thereto, each as amended through the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Option Plans_ "), and (ii) cancel, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Option Plans or otherwise (each, an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of such date. Each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the applicable Option Plan shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Amount over (y) the per share exercise price of such Option, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Option as of the Effective Time. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised at the Effective Time a written consent to the cancellation of the Option immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the receipt of the consideration set forth in the prior sentence, all such written consents to be delivered to the Company (and a copy provided to Parent) prior to the Initial Expiration Time. The Company shall confirm that unexercised options after the Effective Time will only be exercisable for the Merger Consideration. Any such payments shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements. 

  

 (b) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to Section 4.7(a) to any holder of Options such amounts as the Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action (i) (in accordance with that certain SEC no-action letter, dated January 12, 1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom) to provide that the treatment of Options pursuant to Section 4.7(a) will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act, and (ii) to effect the treatment of the Option Plans and Options set forth in this Section 4.7, including obtaining any and all necessary consents.

this Section 7.2(a) by the Company. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the consummation of the Offer the Board shall be permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide nonpublic information or data to, any Person in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such Person made after the date of this Agreement and prior to the consummation of the Offer _if and only if, prior to taking any of the actions set forth above:_ (A) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives shall have violated any of the provisions of this Section 7.2, (B) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor), (x) that such Person is reasonably capable of consummating such Acquisition Proposal taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Superior Proposal from the Person that made the applicable Acquisition Proposal, (C) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor), that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such information would result in a reasonable likelihood of a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (D) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than 24 hours) following any determination by the Board referred to in clauses (B) or (C) above the Company gives Parent written notice of such determination and at least 24 hours prior to participating in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic information to, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the Companys intention to participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose nonpublic information to, such Person, (E) in each such case, the Board has received from the Person being furnished or disclosed any nonpublic information, an executed confidentiality agreement (the subject matter of which shall be limited to the protection of nonpublic information and standstill provisions) on terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall in no event provide such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company or have the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement and (F) simultaneously with or prior to furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously delivered or made available by the Company to Parent). 

  

 (c) 

   

 (i) The Board shall not withdraw, modify or change, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the Boards recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger (" _Change in Recommendation_ ") unless, prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

consummation of the Offer, and if and only if (A) none of the Company, any
of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives have violated any of the
provisions of this Section 7.2, (B) the Company has provided Parent with
written notice that the Board intends to take such action, such notice to
specify in reasonable detail the reason(s) for such proposed action, such
notice to be delivered not less than three full Business Days prior to the
time the action is to be taken; (C) during the three Business Day period
following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (B) above, Parent
shall have the right to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Company and its advisors shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, (D) following any such negotiations and adjustments pursuant
to clause (C) above, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized
financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor),, that
failure to make such Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Board to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law and (E) if the Change in Recommendation is being made
primarily as a result of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and the Company shall have complied with the
provisions of this Section 7.2 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.
Any Change in Recommendation in accordance with all of the provisions of this
Section 7.2(c)(i) shall not be deemed a breach of Section 7.2(a) hereof. The
Board shall not, in connection with any such Change in Recommendation, take
any action to change the approval of the Board of this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated hereby, including for purposes of any state
takeover statute or other state law (including, without limitation, Section
203 of the DGCL) and the Companys certificate of incorporation (including,
without limitation, Article Eleventh and Article Fourteenth thereof) and
bylaws. 

   

 (ii) The Board shall not recommend, approve, enter into or accept a Superior Proposal unless prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company has not violated any of the provisions of this Section 7.2, and the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate this Agreement to accept such Superior Proposal or to recommend such Superior Proposal to the stockholders of the Company would result in a reasonable likelihood of a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not have the right to take any such action or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4(c) hereof and any purported termination pursuant to Section 9.4(c) hereof shall be void and of no force or effect, unless prior to any such action or termination: (A) the Company has provided Parent with written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4(c) hereof and take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal, such notice to specify in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal then determined to be more favorable and the parties thereto and be delivered not less than three full Business Days prior to the time the action is to be taken; and (B) during the three Business Day period following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (A) above, Parent shall have the right to propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Company and its advisors shall negotiate in good faith with Parent regarding such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (C) following any such negotiations and adjustments pursuant to clause (B) above, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial 

   ##### 

  

    

advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor), that such proposal is
a Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate this Agreement to
accept such Superior Proposal or to recommend such Superior Proposal to the
stockholders of the Company would result in a reasonable likelihood of a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law. The Company agrees that any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 7.2(c)(ii). Any Board action taken in accordance
with all of the provisions of this Section 7.2(c)(ii) shall not be deemed a
breach of Section 7.2(a) hereof. 

  

 (d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all discussions, negotiations or communications with any other Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within four Business Days of the date hereof) request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement on or after October 1, 2005 in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal with the Company to return or destroy all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and to destroy all summaries, analyses or extracts of or based upon such information in the possession of such Person or any of its representatives. The Company agrees not to release any Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to use commercially reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party, except that, if requested to do so by a Person who is a party to a confidentiality or standstill agreement with the Company that forbids such Person from submitting an Acquisition Proposal to the Company, the Company may provide a conditional waiver of such provision of the confidentiality or standstill agreement between the Company and such Person solely to the extent necessary and for the limited purpose of permitting such Person to submit a Superior Proposal directed and disclosed only to the Board and its Representatives _if and only if_ (i) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives have violated any of the provisions of this Section 7.2, (ii) such Person has submitted a written certification to the Company that such Person will if such provision is waived promptly submit a Superior Proposal with no financing or due diligence conditions or contingencies, and a copy of such certification has been delivered to Parent, (iii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor), that the taking of such action is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would result in a reasonably likelihood of a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (iv) the Board has notified Parent of such request and the identity of such Person within 24 hours of receipt and has notified Parent of its intention to take such action with respect to such Person not less than 24 hours in advance of the taking of such action, and (v) no other provision of such confidentiality or standstill agreement is amended, waived, or modified in any respect. In the event that a conditional waiver satisfying the requirements in the foregoing sentence is granted and such Person does not promptly (and in any event within four Business Days) thereafter submit an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal (determined in good faith by the Board after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) with no financing or due diligence conditions or contingencies, any such conditional waiver shall be void and of no effect. 

  

 (e) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and confirm in writing if any proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or its Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, indicating in connection with such notice, the name of such Person(s) and the material terms 

   ##### 

  

    

and conditions of such proposal or offer. The Company shall thereafter keep
Parent informed, on a current basis, as to the material terms and conditions
of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

effecting all filings, consents, approvals, orders, registrations
and declarations as may be required under the laws of any foreign country in
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries conducts any business or owns
any assets, and (f) the taking of all acts reasonably necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in Annex A and Article VIII to be satisfied.
In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take all such action. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in connection with any filing or submission or other action
required to be made or taken by any party to effect the Offer, the Merger and
all other Transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, commit to any divestiture transaction,
and Parent shall not be required to divest or hold separate or otherwise take
or commence to take any action that, in the reasonable discretion of Parent,
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the
Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Parent or any of Parents
subsidiaries or any material portion of assets or businesses of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of the Parents subsidiaries. 

  

 7.4 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants, consultants and other authorized representatives of Parent (" _Parent Representatives_ "), in order to evaluate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, assets, properties, contracts, books and records so that they may have the opportunity to make such investigations as they shall reasonably request in connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that such investigation shall not affect the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement. During such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives to), to the extent permitted by Law, furnish promptly to such Parent Representatives all information concerning its finances, operations, business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, and respond to such inquires as Parent and Purchaser shall from time to time reasonably request, and use commercially reasonable efforts to make available during normal business hours to Parent, Purchaser and the Parent Representatives the appropriate individuals (including management, personnel, employees, attorneys, accountants and other professionals) for reasonable inquiries regarding the Companys and the Subsidiaries businesses, properties and personnel. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall (a) promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser (i) a copy of each form, report, schedule, statement, registration statement and other document filed by it or any Subsidiary during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws or the DGCL, and (ii) on a monthly basis an unaudited monthly consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the month then ended and related consolidated statements of earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity (which the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish no later than fifteen Business Days after the end of each month); and (b) keep Parent apprised on a current and timely basis of the status of, and any significant issues relating to, the Companys consolidated financial statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information that would cause a violation of Law or any confidentiality agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement (in which case the parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, if such arrangements can be made by the parties using their reasonable best efforts and, if material to the Company, without such violation). The Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 24, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between the Company and Parent shall apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its subsidiaries and the Companys officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives hereunder.

 7.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who is now, has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys certificate of incorporation and the Companys by-laws against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each, a " _Claim_ ") to the extent that any such Claim is based on, or arises out of, the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in each case to the extent that any such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to or at the Effective Time (including to the extent that any such Claim is based on, or arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, other than in each case for Claims judicially determined to involve a willful breach of this Agreement, and (ii) advance to such Indemnified Party its fees and expenses (including attorneys fees) periodically and promptly upon request to the fullest extent permitted under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as of the date hereof, subject to the provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto. Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws and indemnification agreements as in effect as of the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time unless otherwise required by Law. In addition, until six years from the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification of the Indemnified Parties for actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time than those set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the six-year period specified in the foregoing sentences, in the event any Claim or Claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such Claim or Claims shall continue until the disposition thereof. 

  

 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time the current directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor a policy or policies providing at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not less advantageous to the Insured Parties than such current policy) covering the Persons serving as officers and directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such (including, without limitation, the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement); 

   ##### 

  

    

 _provided, however_ , that (i) in no event shall Parent be required to expend
on an annual basis more than 200% of the current amount expended by the
Company (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage; and (ii) if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance
otherwise called for by this Section 7.6(b) Parent shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the
Insurance Amount. The Company represents to Parent that the last annual
premium paid for such insurance prior to the date hereof was $270,500.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations under this Section 7.6(b) shall
be satisfied if the Company, prior to the Effective Time and only with the
prior written consent of Parent, or the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time purchases a "tail" policy under the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy that (i) has an effective term of
six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers the Insured Parties for
actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time which were
committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such
(including, without limitation, the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement);and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including without
limitation coverage amounts) that are at least as favorable in the aggregate
as the terms and conditions of the Companys directors and officers
insurance policy in effect on the date hereof. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent and its insurance broker in connection with the provision of
information relating to the analysis of, and application for, insurance
responsive to the requirements of this Section. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this Section 7.6 and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6. 

  

 7.7 _Employees_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.7(a)_ and as provided in Section 7.7(b) below, for a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide employees of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries with employee benefits (other than options and equity incentives) that are in the aggregate substantially similar to those employee benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accruals, determination of levels of benefits or any other purposes) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Subsidiary to the same extent such service was taken into account for such purposes under comparable Employee Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.7 nor any other provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation and their subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any of their respective employees after the Effective Time to the extent permitted by 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable Law or to terminate or amend any employee benefit plan, including
without limitation any Employee Benefit Plan to the extent permitted pursuant
to the term of such plan or applicable Law. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation hereby agrees to assume the Companys binding obligations under any collective bargaining agreements or other labor agreements, employment agreements, employment termination agreements and individual benefit arrangements, all as in effect at the Effective Time, and to provide employees covered by such agreements and arrangements with compensation and benefits as set forth in such agreements and arrangements. 

  

 7.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably be expected to cause any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or any condition set forth in Annex A or Article VIII to not be satisfied at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time and (b) any failure of the Company, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in all material respects any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 7.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover statute or other similar Law becomes or is deemed to become applicable to the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option, this Agreement or any of the Transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to render such Law inapplicable to all of the foregoing. 

  

 7.10 _Litigation Matters_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to vigorously contest and resist any Litigation, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of any of the Transactions, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any Litigation commenced prior to or after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors by any stockholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger and any other transaction contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld).

 (a) Purchaser shall have materially breached its obligations under this Agreement by failing to commence the Offer as provided in Section 1.1 hereof; provided, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.4(a) if the Company is at such time in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement; 

  

 (b) there shall have occurred, on the part of Parent or Purchaser, a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which is incapable of being cured or is not cured within 30 days after notice in writing of such breach is given by the Company to the party committing the breach, except in any case, for such failures which are not reasonably likely to affect adversely Parents or Purchasers ability to complete the Offer or the Merger; or 

  

 (c) in connection with entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.2, provided that (i) the Company and its Representatives shall have complied in all respects with Section 7.2 in connection therewith, and (ii) the Company has prior thereto paid in full the Termination Fee and Reimbursable Expenses due to Parent and Purchaser under Section 10.1.

Nothing contained in this Section 9.5 shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement, provided, however, that Parent and Purchaser shall not be able to obtain and damages, consequential, punitive or otherwise, as a result of such breach if Parent has received the Termination Fee and Reimbursable Expenses pursuant to Section 10.1.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in any instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, and the failure to take any action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, if such termination is permitted pursuant thereto, shall not give rise to an inference that a party entitled to so terminate this Agreement has waived its right to do so. 

  

ARTICLE X 

   

MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL 

   

 10.1 _Payment of Fees and Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in Section 10.1(b), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses. 

  

 (b) In the event that: 

   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(c)(i) through (v), inclusive, Section 9.3(c)(vii) or Section 9.4(c); or 

   

 (ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(b), Section 9.3(a) (other than a termination due to an occurrence or circumstance that results in a failure of paragraph (a), (b) or (d) of Annex A), Section 9.3(b) or Section 9.3(c)(vi) and (B) prior thereto any Person shall have commenced, publicly proposed or communicated to the Company an Acquisition Proposal or any Person has publicly proposed or communicated to the Company an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal and (C) and concurrently with such termination, or within twelve months thereafter, the Company enters into a merger agreement, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, 

 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent a fee of $7.0 million
(the " _Termination Fee_ "), which amount plus an amount equal to Purchasers
actual, documented, out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable legal, investment banking, accounting, banking and
consulting fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and Purchaser in connection
with the due diligence investigation, the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby not 

  ##### 

  

   

to exceed $2.5 million (the " _Reimbursable Expenses_ "), shall be payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Purchaser. The Termination Fee and Parents good faith estimate of its
Reimbursable Expenses shall be paid and a written acknowledgment by the
Company of its obligation to reimburse Parent for its actual expenses
in excess of such estimated expenses payment shall be delivered (x) at or
prior to the time of, and as a pre-condition to the effectiveness of,
termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.4(c), (y) as
promptly as practicable (and in any event, within two Business Days) in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.3(c) and (z) upon the

 (c) The Company shall not withhold any amounts on any payment under this Section 10.1 unless such withholding is required by Law. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 10.1 are an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly any amounts due pursuant to Section 10.1, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences Litigation which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee or expense reimbursement set forth in Section 10.1, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Litigation, together with interest on the amount due from each date for payment until the date of the payment at a rate equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made plus 3%. 

  

 10.2 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties; Survival of Confidentiality_. The representations and warranties made herein shall not survive beyond the Effective Time. This Section 10.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto which covenants and agreements shall survive in accordance with their respective terms.

 10.3 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, any amendment shall be in compliance with the terms of Section 1.3(b) hereof and (ii) after approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which changes the consideration payable in the Merger or which is otherwise required under any applicable law to be approved by such stockholders without the approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all the parties. 

  

 10.4 _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 10.5 _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be executed manually or by facsimile in any number of counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.
