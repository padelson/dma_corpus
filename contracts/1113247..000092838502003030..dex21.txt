                                SALE AND PURCHASE

          Section 2.01 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the
Closing Conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Seller hereby sells with
economic effect (wirtschaftliche Wirkung) as of January 1, 2002 and, at Closing,
shall assign and transfer to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser hereby purchases
from the Sellers and, at Closing, shall accept the assignment and transfer of,
the number of Company Shares set forth opposite the name of such Seller in the
table set out in Schedule 7.01 (c), such Company Shares in the aggregate
representing the entire issued share capital of the Company. The Purchaser shall
acquire the

                                       -9-

<PAGE>

Company Shares together with all rights and obligations related thereto
(including the right to dividends accrued since January 1, 2002, for the current
and all previous financial years, as far as dividends for the previous financial
years were not actually distributed or profits of the Company were transferred
under the Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement to KPMG DTG as of
the date of this Agreement).

Furthermore, KPMG DTG herewith assigns to the Purchaser its claim against the
Company for reimbursement of the consideration payable by KPMG DTG to Peter and
Michael Blaschitz for the transfer of the Infonova Group Shares to the Company
in the amount of USD 24,500,000 (the "Claim"), such assignment being subject to
the condition precedent that the entire Closing Date Payment or Closing
Consideration Payment, as the case may be, has been received by the Sellers as
set forth in Section 6.02 (d); the Purchaser herewith accepts such assignment.
The assignment set forth in the previous sentence has been taken into account
and is included in the calculation of the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties confirm that the obligation of the Company to satisfy the
Claim shall not be taken into account in calculating the Net Adjustment as the
Claim results from the sale and purchase agreements relating to the Infonova
Group Shares which were entered into on June 7, 2002, i.e. only after the period
relevant for the May 31 Balance Sheet determining the Net Financial Debt of the
Company for purposes of the Net Adjustment.

               Section 2.02      Purchase Price.

               (a) Purchase Price; Purchase Price per Share. The aggregate
         purchase price for all of the Company Shares agreed as of the date
         hereof, is USD 670,164,500 (in words: United States Dollars six hundred
         seventy million one hundred sixty four thousand five hundred) (the
         "Base Purchase Price"). The base purchase price per Company Share is
         USD 79.78 (in words: United States Dollars seventy-nine and seventy
         eight cents) (the "Base Purchase Price per Share"). The Base Purchase
         Price shall be adjusted at or after Closing, as the case may be, in
         accordance with the purchase price adjustment mechanism set forth in
         Section 2.03 of this Agreement.

               (b) Closing Date Payment; Closing Consideration Payment.

                     (i) Cash Payment. At Closing, the Base Purchase Price as
               adjusted by the Net Adjustment or the Estimated Net Adjustment,
               as the case may be (the "Closing Date Payment"), shall be paid
               completely in cash in immediately available funds in United
               States Dollars, free of any bank charges in accordance with the
               provisions set forth below. The Purchaser's obligation to pay the
               entire Closing Date Payment in cash as provided for in this
               paragraph (i) is, however, subject to the Purchaser having been
               able to obtain sufficient financing through a combined funding
               consisting of a debt and/or an equity offering on market terms
               and conditions (the "Financing"). The Purchaser has, prior to the
               execution of this Agreement, provided the Sellers' financial
               advisors with a copy of a letter from its financial advisor with
               respect to a potential Financing. The Purchaser shall use its
               best efforts (alle Massnahmen ergreifen) to launch and close a
               public equity offering to raise sufficient cash, alongside its
               debt facilities, and

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

                   in sufficient time to enable the Purchaser to satisfy the
                   entire Closing Date Payment in cash. If in the reasonable
                   opinion of the Purchaser (acting in good faith and after
                   consultation with the Sellers), the equity market environment
                   or the technology stock market environment has materially
                   deteriorated between the date of this Agreement and the
                   Closing such that the Purchaser has not been able to launch
                   and close a public equity offering on reasonable terms to
                   raise sufficient cash to enable the Purchaser, together with
                   the intended debt funding, to satisfy the entire Closing Date
                   Payment in cash, then it shall so notify the Sellers who may
                   elect to (aa) defer the closing for up to 30 days, while the
                   Purchaser continues its best efforts to attempt to obtain the
                   Financing; or (bb) to receive, instead of receiving the
                   entire Closing Date Payment in cash, the consideration set
                   forth in (ii) below. For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby
                   set forth that in such case, the Purchaser's obligation to
                   pay the consideration in the cash / shares ratio outlined in
                   (ii) is not conditional on receipt of any portion of the
                   Financing.

                        (ii) Cash / Share Payment. If the Purchaser is not able
                   to obtain the Financing before Closing, or if the Sellers
                   elect to cause the Purchaser to pay the consideration as set
                   forth in this paragraph (ii) as permitted in clause (i)
                   above, the Purchaser shall pay the consideration at Closing
                   in a cash / share ratio as follows (the "Closing
                   Consideration Payment"):

                              (aa) USD 280,000,000 (in words: United States
                        Dollars two hundred and eighty million) (the "Base Cash
                        Price") as adjusted by the Net Adjustment or the
                        Estimated Net Adjustment, as the case may be, shall be
                        payable in cash in immediately available funds in United
                        States Dollars, free of any bank charges (the "Closing
                        Date Cash Amount") in accordance with the provisions set
                        forth below.

                              (bb) USD 390,164,500 (in words: United States
                        Dollars three hundred ninety million one hundred sixty
                        four thousand five hundred) of the Closing Consideration
                        Payment (the "Equity Consideration") shall consist of
                        the "Fixed Equity Consideration" and the "Floating
                        Equity Consideration" and shall be payable in validly
                        issued, fully paid up and non-assessable shares of
                        common stock, par value of USD 0.01 per share, of the
                        Purchaser (the "KCI Common Stock") in accordance with
                        the provisions of Section 2.04. The aggregate number of
                        shares of KCI Common Stock to be issued, assigned,
                        transferred and delivered at Closing is hereinafter
                        referred to as the "Exchange Shares". The Exchange
                        Shares shall be of the same class and have the same
                        terms and rights as the currently outstanding shares of
                        KCI Common Stock, and shall not be subject to any
                        restriction on transfer other than those applicable
                        under the Securities Act to "restricted securities"
                        issued in an "offshore" placement in accordance with
                        Regulation S under the Securities Act.

              Section 2.03 Purchase Price Adjustment.

              (a) Net Financial Debt Adjustment. The Sellers and the Purchaser
       determined the Base Purchase Price and the Base Cash Price for the
       Company Shares in part based on the Net Financial Debt of the Company as
       of March 31, 2002 in the amount of EUR 17,021,000 (in words: Euro
       seventeen million twenty one thousand) as set forth in the Company's
       Audited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (the "March 31 NFD").
       Net Financial Debt for purposes of this Agreement means the financial
       debt minus the cash and the cash equivalents of the Company and its
       Subsidiaries (calculated on a consolidated basis, but only including
       those balance sheet items expressly set forth in Schedule 2.03 (a)).
       Should the Net Financial Debt of the Company as of May 31, 2002 (the "May
       31 NFD") as set forth in the Company's audited interim balance sheet as
       of May 31, 2002 (the "May 31 Balance Sheet") be an amount greater than
       the March 31 NFD, the Base Purchase Price and therefore the Base Cash
       Price, if applicable, shall be reduced by a positive amount equal to the
       difference between the May 31 NFD and the March 31 NFD (a "Negative NFD
       Adjustment"). Should the May 31 NFD be an amount lower than the March 31
       NFD, the Base Purchase Price and therefore the Base Cash Price, if
       applicable, shall be increased by a positive amount equal to the
       difference between the May 31 NFD and the March 31 NFD (a "Positive NFD
       Adjustment").

              (b) Net Working Capital Adjustment. If the May 31 Balance Sheet
       shows Net Working Capital (the "May 31 Net Working Capital") less than
       EUR 12,500,000.00 (in words: Euro twelve million five hundred thousand)
       (the "Forecast May 31 Net Working Capital"), the Base Purchase Price and
       therefore the Base Cash Price, if applicable, shall be reduced by a
       positive amount equal to the difference between the May 31 Net Working
       Capital and the Forecast May 31 Net Working Capital (a "Negative Net
       Working Capital Adjustment"). Should the May 31 Net Working Capital be
       greater than the May 31 Forecast Net Working Capital, the Base Purchase
       Price and therefore the Base Cash Price, if applicable, shall be
       increased by a positive amount equal to the difference between the May 31
       Net Working Capital and the Forecast May 31 Net Working Capital (a
       "Positive Net Working Capital Adjustment"). For the purposes of this
       Agreement, May 31 Net Working Capital shall mean - with each item
       calculated on a consolidated basis - the sum of the balance sheet items
       (line by line) indicated as Working Capital in Schedule 2.03 (b) hereto
       as set forth on the May 31 Balance Sheet.

              (c) Preparation of Interim Balance Sheet. The Sellers shall cause
       the Company to prepare the May 31 Balance Sheet in accordance with the
       practices, principles, policies, assumptions and estimates of the Company
       used for purposes of preparing the Company's Audited Consolidated Interim
       Financial Statements. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts
       to cause the May 31 Balance Sheet to be prepared within 60 days of the
       date hereof. The Purchaser agrees not to interfere in the preparation of
       the May 31 Balance Sheet.

                  (d) Base Purchase Price Adjustment. The aggregate effect of
         the positive or negative NFD Adjustment and the Positive or Negative
         Net Working Capital Adjustment on the Base Purchase Price and therefore
         the Base Cash Price, if applicable, is called for the purposes of this
         Agreement the "Net Adjustment". The Net Adjustment shall initially be
         calculated in EUR and then converted into USD on the basis of the Euro
         Exchange Rate for May 31, 2002. The Sellers, if prior to the Closing,
         and the Purchaser, if after the Closing, shall cause the Company to
         prepare a provisional calculation of the Net Adjustment in accordance
         with the above procedures. The mathematical calculation of the Net
         Adjustment shall be reviewed and confirmed in writing by the Company's
         auditor (i.e., Ernst & Young AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft) and
         shall, as confirmed, unless mechanical errors in computation can be
         shown, be binding upon the Parties. The Parties agree to use their
         reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's auditor to provide the
         Parties with a written confirmation of the calculation of the Net
         Adjustment as soon as possible. If the Net Adjustment has been
         confirmed in writing by the Company's auditor prior to the Closing, the
         Base Purchase Price and therefore the Base Cash Price, if applicable,
         shall be adjusted by an amount in cash equal to the Net Adjustment. The
         final purchase price calculated on the basis of the Base Purchase Price
         or the Base Cash Price and the Equity Consideration, as the case may
         be, and the Net Adjustment shall be referred to hereinafter as the
         "Final Purchase Price". If the Net Adjustment has not been confirmed in
         writing by the Company's auditor prior to the Closing, the Company's
         good faith estimate of the Net Adjustment shall be delivered in writing
         by the Company to the Purchaser with (i) supporting calculation and
         (ii) a representation by the Company that the estimate is based on the
         Company's good faith belief as to the elements to be included in the
         calculation of the Net Adjustment (hereinafter called the "Estimated
         Net Adjustment") at least five days prior to the Closing. The Sellers
         and the Company shall prior to the Closing provide the Purchaser with
         full access to the books and records used to calculate the Net
         Adjustment and the Estimated Net Adjustment, as the case may be. If
         only the Estimated Net Adjustment (rather than the Net Adjustment) was
         available at Closing, the Closing Date Payment or the Closing Date Cash
         Amount, as the case may be, shall be calculated on the basis of the
         Base Purchase Price or the Base Cash Price, as the case may be, and the
         Estimated Net Adjustment. A positive amount equal to the difference
         between the Net Adjustment and the Estimated Net Adjustment (the "Final
         Net Adjustment"), shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Sellers or the
         Sellers to the Purchaser, as the case may be, within 5 Business Days
         after the Net Adjustment has been confirmed in writing by the Company's
         auditor. As to the payment of the Closing Date Payment or the Closing
         Consideration Payment and the Final Net Adjustment, if any, any right
         of set-off (Aufrechnungsrecht) or retention (Zuruckbehaltungsrecht)
         shall be excluded.

           Section 2.04 Exchange Shares. The exact number of Exchange Shares to
be issued, assigned, transferred and delivered by the Purchaser under Section
2.02 (b) (ii) as of Closing shall be the sum of the Fixed Equity Consideration
and the Floating Equity Consideration:

           (a) The Fixed Equity Consideration shall be the number of shares of
       KCI Common Stock determined by dividing USD 195,082,250 (in words: United
       States Dollars one hundred ninety five million eighty two thousand two
       hundred and fifty) by USD 16.09 (in words: United States Dollars sixteen
       and nine cents) and after performing such calculation rounding up to the
       nearest whole number of shares of KCI Common Stock (the "Common Stock
       Price as of Signing");

           (b) The Floating Equity Consideration shall be that number of shares
       in KCI Common Stock determined by dividing USD 195,082,250 (in words:
       United States Dollars one hundred ninety five million eighty two thousand
       two hundred and fifty) by the average market price in United States
       Dollars of KCI Common Stock on the consolidated report of trading at the
       close of official trading hours on the NASDAQ over the 10 trading day
       period ending on the second trading day prior to the Closing Date (the
       "Common Stock Price as of Closing") and after performing such calculation
       rounding up to the nearest whole number of shares in KCI Common Stock.

           (c) The Exchange Shares shall be transferred together with any and
       all rights attached thereto. The Exchange Shares shall be delivered to
       KPMG DTG acting on behalf of all Sellers. KPMG DTG and the Minority
       Shareholders have agreed that the Closing Date Payment or the Closing
       Consideration Payment as the case may be shall be allocated to the
       individual Sellers in accordance with Schedule 7.01 (c) hereto.

           Section 2.05 Value Added Tax, Other Transfer Tax. The Purchaser shall
pay all costs for the issuance and the transfer of the Exchange Shares and any
applicable Value Added Tax (VAT) as well as all stock transfer and stamp taxes
or any other transfer tax, if any, under any Applicable Law which might become
due in connection with the transfer of the Company Shares contemplated by this
Agreement. However, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
ensure, to the extent practicable, that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement do not become subject to VAT or other transfer taxes under any
Applicable Law.

           Section 2.06 Infonova. The Purchaser or the Company shall enter into
an agreement with Peter and Michael Blaschitz providing for the Purchaser's or
the Company's payment to them of additional consideration calculated on an
earn-out basis in respect of Infonova on terms no less favorable for Peter and
Michael Blaschitz than the terms set forth in Schedule 2.06.

                               CLOSING CONDITIONS

       The Sellers and the Purchaser are obligated to consummate the sale and
purchase of the Company Shares as well as to make the Closing Date Payment or
Closing Consideration Payment, as the case may be, at Closing, subject only to
the satisfaction of the following conditions (each a "Closing Condition" and
jointly the "Closing Conditions"):

          Section 3.01 Cartel Approval. All required approvals of the competent
cartel authorities shall have been granted or shall be deemed to be have been
granted (e.g., after expiry of the applicable time limit for taking a decision).

          Section 3.02 SEC Approval. The Parties acknowledge that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may raise issues
regarding the independence of KPMG (as defined below) under SEC regulations.
Therefore, unless this condition is waived by KPMG DTG, the Closing shall be
subject to the condition that the SEC confirms in a no-action letter customary
for transactions of this type that the execution, delivery and performance of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the ownership of the
Exchange Shares by the Sellers, the Non-Competition Agreement and the TSA, will
not endanger the independence of KPMG from the Purchaser within the meaning of
the applicable SEC regulations and, in particular, that KPMG will not have a
"mutuality of interest" or a "direct or material indirect business relationship"
with, or a "direct financial interest or material indirect financial interest"
in any of its audit clients that are also clients of or enter into business
relationships with or invest in the Purchaser or any of its affiliates, or in
which the Purchaser or any of its affiliates or any departing Company Partner or
employee invests. For the purposes of the foregoing, "KPMG" includes KPMG LLP or
any of its Subsidiaries ("KPMG US"), or any other firms not owned by KPMG US but
conducting audit activities outside the United States for SEC registrants under
the name KPMG or derivations thereof, including KPMG DTG, or otherwise as part
of the KPMG network of firms. The Parties will consult and co-operate with each
other with regard to communications with the SEC in relation to this Closing
Condition provided that KPMG DTG's counsel shall lead such process.

          Section 3.03 No Injunctions; Objecting Shareholders. There shall not
exist any temporary restraining order, injunction or other order issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting the consummation of the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that
(a) one or more orders or injunctions exist prohibiting the transfer of less
than 5% in the aggregate of the Company Shares or (b) less than 5 % of the
Company Shares are not delivered at Closing for any other reasons, the Parties
shall nevertheless consummate the Closing and the Purchaser shall deliver at
Closing the entire portion of the total Closing Date Payment or the Closing
Consideration Payment, as the case may be, owed hereunder with respect to the
Company Shares delivered at Closing. The Purchaser shall have no rights or
indemnification claims against any of the Sellers arising from the fact that not
all of the Company Shares were delivered at Closing to the Purchaser under (a)
or (b) above; provided that the Sellers shall have used their reasonable best
efforts to ensure that all of the Company Shares are transferred to the
Purchaser at Closing. In the event of a squeeze-

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

out pursuant to Sec. 327a et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act of the
objecting Minority Shareholders, the Sellers shall, within five Business Days of
the consummation of any squeeze out, pay to the Purchaser any amount by which
the consideration to be paid per Company Share in the squeeze-out procedure
exceeds the Final Purchase Price per Share for the Company Shares not delivered
at Closing, and the Purchaser shall, within such five Business Days, pay to KPMG
DTG on behalf of the Sellers any amount by which such consideration is less the
Final Purchase Price per Share for the Company Shares not delivered at Closing.

          Section 3.04 Waiver of Closing Conditions. KPMG DTG may, at any time
between the date hereof and the Closing Date or on the Closing Date, waive,

in Section 3.01 may not be waived by the Sellers, nor by the Purchaser, nor by
both acting jointly.

                          TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

          Section 4.01 Termination prior to Closing. Prior to Closing, this
Agreement may be terminated (Rucktritt vom Vertrag) only for the following
reasons:

          (a) Non-occurrence of Closing Conditions. This Agreement may be
      terminated by KPMG DTG or the Purchaser by written notice to the other, if
      the Closing Conditions set forth in this Agreement have not been satisfied
      or, if permitted, waived on or before 180 days from the date hereof, or
      such later date as KPMG DTG and the Purchaser may agree upon in writing
      (the "Cut Off Date"). However, the Purchaser shall only be entitled to
      terminate this Agreement after the Cut Off Date if the Purchaser has
      complied with its obligations set forth under Section 5.05 (a) and (b)
      (Required Approvals).

          (b) Violation of Representation and Warranties and Obligations. Either
      the Purchaser on the one hand or KPMG DTG (acting on behalf of all
      Sellers) on the other hand may terminate this Agreement prior to Closing
      in case of a breach of (i) the Representations and Warranties of the
      Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be, or of (ii) the obligations
      of the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be, set forth in this
      Agreement; provided, however, that such termination right shall only be
      available, if (aa) the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be, has
      informed the other by written notice of such violation or breach; (bb)
      such violation or breach has not been cured within 30 days of receipt of
      such notice; and (cc) such violation or breach has had or is reasonably
      likely to have ((alpha)) a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, in the
      case of a violation or breach by the Sellers; or a Material Adverse Effect
      on the Purchaser, in the case of a breach by the Purchaser or ((beta))
      such violation or breach materially impairs

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

      such Party's indemnification rights under this Agreement, or in the case
      of the Sellers materially impairs the Sellers' rights under the
      Registration Rights Agreement.

          Section 4.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 4.01, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no Party hereto shall have any liability to
the other Party or Parties (other than for breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination), except that the provisions of this Section and of Section
10.01 and Sections 11.01, 11.02, 11.03, 11.04, 11.05, 11.06, 11.07, 11.08, 11.09
and 11.10 shall survive such termination. In the case of a termination under
Section 4.01 (b), the terminating Party shall be entitled to claim from the
other Party reimbursement of its costs and expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement.

          Section 5.01 Notification. At all times prior to Closing, each Party

Wiedmann, Bernd Erle, Peter Melcher and Hendrik Ansink, and in the case of the
Purchaser, Rand Blazer, Michael Donahue, Robert Lamb and David Black, become
aware of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that would be
likely to cause any of the Representations and Warranties given as of the
Closing Date by such Party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect as of the Closing Date and (b) any material
failure to comply with or satisfy any of the obligations in this Agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by such Party under this Agreement. In case of a
breach of this notification obligation, the other Party continues to be obliged
to perform its own obligations, unless the breach has resulted in a Material
Adverse Effect on the other Party.

notice by KPMG DTG or the Company to David Black and/or Mike Donahue at the
Purchaser, whereby the provisions relating to notices under Section 11.02 shall
apply accordingly, of the proposed transaction or action for which such consent

              (t) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to do or omit to

              Section 5.03 Non-Competition and Shared Services Agreements.

              (a) Non-Competition Agreement. On or prior to the Closing, KPMG
       DTG and the Company shall terminate the Division of Services Agreement
       between them dated October 18 and 20, 2000 and shall enter into a
       non-competition agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
       Schedule 5.03 (a) (the "Non-Competition Agreement"), with only such
       changes, if any, as may be necessary to secure the SEC approval referred
       to in Section 3.02 above or as may be mutually agreed by KPMG DTG and the
       Purchaser. On or prior to the Closing, KPMG DTG shall use its reasonable
       best efforts to cause KPMG Alpen-Treuhand GmbH and KPMG Austria GmbH to
       enter into a substantially similar agreement with the Company and to
       cause KPMG Holding, Zurich to enter into a substantially similar
       agreement with the Company or to cause such parties to become parties to
       the Non-Competition Agreement.

              (b) Transition Services Agreement. On or prior to the Closing,
       KPMG DTG and the Company shall negotiate in good faith and enter into and
       replace the Shared Services Agreement with a Transition Services
       Agreement pursuant to which KPMG DTG shall agree to provide to the
       Company certain transitional services ("Transitional Services"),
       including information technology, knowledge management, internal
       accounting and human resources services and office facilities in
       accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Shared Services
       Agreement as modified by the provisions set forth below or such
       additional or different terms as may be required to secure the SEC
       approval referred to in Section 3.02 above. On or prior to the Closing,
       KPMG DTG shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG Fides,
       Zurich to enter into a substantially similar agreement with the Company.
       Such agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement" or "TSA") shall
       include the following terms and conditions:

                  (i)  Term. The TSA shall have an initial term (the "Initial
              Term") of 12 months and shall continue in effect thereafter unless
              terminated by either Party upon at least six months written
              notice, provided however that the maximum term of the TSA shall be
              3 years.

                  (ii) Remuneration. The services provided under the TSA shall
              be provided at cost on the basis historically used by KPMG DTG to
              allocate expenses to the Company. In the event the Company
              terminates any Transitional Service prior to expiration of the
              Initial Term, the Company shall pay KPMG DTG an amount equal to
              the cost of providing such service for the balance of the Initial

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

          Term based upon the cost of the Company's use of the service in the 12
          months preceding the Closing.

               (iii) Migration and Termination Costs. Upon a delivery of notice
          to terminate a Transitional Service, the parties shall co-operate in
          developing a transition plan for the winding down of such Transitional
          Service. The Company shall pay the allocated actual cost of any
          employee of KPMG DTG providing any migration services, provided
          however that KPMG DTG and the Company shall use their reasonable best
          efforts to mitigate such costs.

               (iv)  In connection with the termination of any Transitional
          Service, the Company shall pay its pro rata share of all expenses
          actually incurred in connection with the termination by KPMG DTG of
          third-party contracts in effect as of the date hereof which are for
          the purpose of providing such service; provided however that KPMG DTG
          and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to mitigate
          such costs.

               (v)   Office Space. In cases where KPMG DTG and the Company
          occupy common facilities, they shall have separate and distinct office
          signage and their offices shall be clearly distinguishable from one
          another. The Sellers shall pay the reasonable costs of any required
          build out or modification of such common facilities as necessary to
          separate each of the premises from which the Consulting Business
          operates from the reminder of the premises of KPMG DTG and to make
          those premises accessible only by the use of appropriate keys or other
          secure access systems to be provided by the Company exclusively,
          provided that the costs for the key and secure access systems shall
          not be borne by the Sellers but by the Purchaser or the Company. The
          Purchaser and the Sellers shall co-operate and consult with each other
          with respect to the manner of such separation. In cases where KPMG DTG
          subleases space to the Company for the Company's exclusive use, the
          Company shall, in accordance with the terms of KPMG DTG's and the
          Company's basic agreement on office use use its reasonable best
          efforts to enter directly into a lease with the lessor as soon as
          reasonably practicable. It is understood that the Company's obligation
          under each existing lease or sublease with KPMG DTG shall continue in
          full force and effect until the relevant expiration date unless
          terminated prior to such date in accordance with its terms.

               (vi)  Confidentiality. KPMG DTG and the Company shall undertake
          to use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that confidential
          information of KPMG DTG regarding the business and affairs of KPMG DTG
          is not communicated to the Company and confidential information of the
          Company regarding the business and affairs of the Company is not
          communicated to KPMG DTG.

          Section 5.04 No Impairment; Antidilution. From the date hereof and
until the Closing, neither Party shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

partners and directors not to, effect any transaction involving the purchase of
any business or assets of any Person which could reasonably be expected to
impair the ability of the Purchaser to satisfy the Closing Conditions to its
obligations hereunder or otherwise delay the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser shall furthermore not enter into a re-capitalization or pay, declare
or set a record date with respect to any of its equity securities for any
dividend, distribution, spin-off, split-off, stock split or similar transaction.

              Section 5.05 Required Approvals. With respect to the approvals
necessary for the execution of this Agreement the Parties agree as follows:

              (a) The Parties shall co-operate and use their reasonable best
       efforts to secure as promptly as practicable all requisite approvals
       necessitated by this Agreement and to satisfy the Closing Conditions and
       the Condition Precedent to the Parties' respective obligations hereunder.
       Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Parties agree that all requests
       and enquiries with regard to the Closing Conditions set out in Section
       3.01 from any Governmental Authority shall be dealt with by them in
       consultation with each other and that they shall promptly co-operate with
       and provide all necessary information reasonably required by such
       Governmental Authority upon being requested to do so by such Governmental
       Authority or by the other Party.

              (b) Except as set forth expressly below, with respect to the
       Closing Conditions set forth in Section 3.01, the Purchaser shall comply
       with any requirements of the competent competition or cartel authorities
       in order to obtain the approval for the Closing of this Agreement. If
       necessary in order to avoid a negative decision by any applicable
       competition or cartel authority or a delay to the Closing beyond the
       Cut-Off-Date, the Purchaser shall advise such authority of its
       willingness to agree to and shall sell or otherwise dispose of, hold
       separate or divest itself of any shares or participation or agree to any
       other limitations regarding the right of the Purchaser or any of its
       Subsidiaries to effectively control or operate its business, assets or
       operations, provided however that the Purchaser shall not be required to
       take such actions and/or agree to such limitations to the extent they
       would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or on the Purchaser
       (it being understood that if the Purchaser is required to dispose of,
       hold separate or divest itself of any asset, the Material Adverse Effect
       standard will be measured as if the Company were required to make such
       disposal or divestiture).

              Section 5.06 Access to Information; Monthly Financials. Between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Parties agree on the following
information rights and notification obligations:

              (a) Access to Information. The Sellers shall cause the Company to
       (i) provide to the Purchaser access at reasonable times upon reasonable
       prior notice to its officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
       other facilities and to its books and records and (ii) furnish promptly
       to the Purchaser such information concerning its business, properties,
       contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects as the
       Purchaser or

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

     its representatives may reasonably request. The Purchaser shall appoint in
     writing one representative through whom all such requests shall be made.

          (b) Monthly Financials. Without prejudice to (a) above, the Sellers
     shall deliver to the Purchaser, within 15 days after the end of each
     calendar month, financial statements for each such calendar month for the
     Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, including a balance sheet dated
     as of the end of such calendar month, prepared by the management of the
     Company in good faith on a basis consistent with the monthly reports
     routinely prepared by the management ("Monthly Financial Statements").

          Section 5.07 Visits / Meetings with Clients and Consulting Employees.

          (a) Visits of clients / Strategic Partners. Between the date hereof
     and the Closing Date, KPMG DTG shall, in coordination with the Company and
     the Purchaser, cause the Company's management to arrange for meetings
     between representatives of the Purchaser, the Company and KPMG DTG with ten
     major clients (identity to be mutually agreed), and three parties to major
     Strategic Alliance Contracts (identity to be mutually agreed) in order to
     encourage these clients to continue to work with the Company after Closing.

          (b) Consulting Employees. Between the date hereof and the Closing,
     KPMG DTG shall, in coordination with the Company and the Purchaser, arrange
     for a meeting of the Consulting Employees where the Purchaser shall have
     the opportunity to present its concept on the Company's further operation
     to the Consulting Employees; KPMG DTG shall use its reasonable best efforts
     to cause the Company's management to use its reasonable best efforts to
     support the Purchaser in encouraging the Consulting Employees to continue
     their employment relationship with the Company after Closing.

          Section 5.08 Mutual Release of Guarantees.

          (a) KPMG DTG and the Purchaser agree that the Purchaser hereby assumes
     as of the Closing all obligations under any guarantees that KPMG DTG or any
     of its Subsidiaries (other than the Group Companies) has given with respect
     to liabilities and obligations of the Group Companies or any of them. The
     Purchaser shall undertake its reasonable best efforts to achieve the
     consent of the respective beneficiary under such guarantees to such
     assumption. KPMG DTG shall co-operate. As long as and to the extent that
     such consent by the respective beneficiary has not been granted, the
     Purchaser and KPMG DTG shall treat each other internally as if such consent
     had been granted. In particular, the Purchaser shall indemnify KPMG DTG and
     its Subsidiaries (other than the Group Companies) against any and all
     claims of the respective beneficiary under such guarantee.

          (b) The previous paragraph 5.08 (a) shall also apply mutatis mutandis
     for KPMG DTG's obligations to assume all obligations under any guarantees
     granted by one of the Group Companies with respect to obligations or
     liabilities of KPMG DTG or one of its Subsidiaries (other than the Group
     Companies)

                                     -23-

          Section 5.09 Purchaser Common Stock Options. The Purchaser agrees that
immediately following the Closing, it will, subject to the grantees entering
into the Purchaser's so called Managing Director Contract of Employment or such
other employment agreement as is applicable to the classification of such
grantee, grant options (the "New Partner Options") to purchase 833,000 shares of
KCI Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the KCI
Common Stock on the Closing Date (or the next NASDAQ trading day if the Closing
Date is not a Nasdaq trading day) to the individuals and in the amounts set
forth on Schedule 5.09. The New Partner Options attributable to each individual
set forth on Schedule 5.09 will vest over a three-year period, with one third
vesting on the first anniversary of the Closing, one third vesting on the second
anniversary of the Closing and one third vesting on the third anniversary of the
Closing. Subject to the foregoing, the New Partner Options will be subject to
the terms of the KPMG Consulting, Inc. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, Standard
Stock Option Agreement and Standard Notice of Grant. The Purchaser will maintain
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-8 registering the KCI
Common Stock underlying the New Partner Options. The Sellers will indemnify the
Purchaser for damages arising from any successful claim by any of the
individuals listed on Schedule 5.09 against Purchaser or the Company alleging
that such individuals were entitled to Company Shares prior to the Closing and
therefore to a right to receive a portion of the Purchase Price hereunder.

          Section 5.10 Cash Pooling Agreement; Inter-Company Balances. The
Sellers shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, the cash pooling arrangement
between KPMG DTG on the one hand and the Group Companies on the other hand shall
be terminated and that any debt balances between KPMG DTG and its Subsidiaries
on the one hand and the Group Companies on the other hand shall be reduced to
zero.

Shares and the payment of the Closing Date Payment or the Closing Consideration
Payment, as the case may be, (the "Closing") hereunder shall take place at the
offices of KPMG DTG located at Taubenstra(beta)e 44 / 45, 10117 Berlin, Germany,
at the earliest of (i) June 30, 2002, if the Closing Conditions provided in
Article 3 have been satisfied or waived (if permitted) by such date, (ii) if the
Closing Conditions have not been satisfied or waived by June 30, 2002, the fifth
day after such Closing Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived (if
permitted), or (iii) such other date as may be agreed between the Purchaser and
the Sellers (the "Closing Date"). Subject to the provisions of Article 4
(Termination prior to Closing), failure to consummate the purchase and sale
provided in this Agreement on the date and at the place determined pursuant to
this Section will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not
relieve any Party of any obligation under this Agreement. All rights under
Sections 323, 325 of the German Civil Code (BGB) shall remain unaffected.

          Section 6.02 Actions as of Closing. At the Closing, as part of a
simultaneous transaction (concurrent conditions; Erfullung Zug um Zug) the
following actions shall be taken:

          (a) Sellers' Closing Certificate. The Sellers shall deliver to the
     Purchaser a certificate in which they confirm (the "Sellers' Closing
     Certificate") that:

               (i)  (aa) all those statements contained in Sections 7.01, 7.02
          and 7.05 which are expressly given as of the Closing Date are true and
          correct as of the Closing Date, and (bb) that the Sellers have
          complied in all material respects with the obligations required to be
          complied with by the Sellers prior to the Closing, except where, in
          each case (aa) or (bb) would not reasonably be expected to have a
          Material Adverse Effect;

               (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
          made a party to any Proceeding (rechtshangiges Verfahren) or, to the
          Seller's Knowledge, has been threatened in writing to be made a party
          to any Proceeding, which has had or is reasonably likely to have a
          negative impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
          in an amount in excess of EUR 20,000,000.00 (in words: Euro twenty
          million). It being understood that any Proceedings initiated by the
          Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall not count for the purposes of
          this provision and the respective Representation and Warranty.

          (b) Purchaser's Closing Certificate. The Purchaser shall deliver a
     certificate to the Sellers in which it confirms (the "Purchasers Closing
     Certificate") that:

               (i)  the statements contained in Sections 8.01, 8.03, 8.04, 8.05,
          8.06 and 8.09 are true and correct as of the Closing Date; and

               (ii) the Purchaser has complied in all material respects with the
          obligations required to be complied with by the Purchaser prior to the
          Closing Date;

          except where in such cases that would not reasonably be expected to
     (i) materially impair the Sellers' rights hereunder or, (ii) have a
     Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) Registration Rights Agreement. The Purchaser shall deliver to KPMG
     DTG the executed Registration Rights Agreement to be entered into between
     the Purchaser and KPMG DTG in the form attached hereto as Schedule 6.02
     (c).

          (d) Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchaser shall deliver to the
     Sellers the entire Purchase Price as follows:

               (i)  If the Purchaser has obtained the Financing in accordance
          with Section 2.02 (b) (i) above, the Purchaser shall

                                      -25-

<PAGE>

                    (aa) deliver to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
               available funds, free of any bank charges, to a bank account
               designated by KPMG DTG to the Purchaser on behalf of all Sellers
               with written notice given at least five Business Days prior to
               the Closing Date (the "Omnibus Account"), an amount equal to 90%
               of the Closing Date Payment set forth in Section 2.02 (b) (i);

                    (bb) the remaining 10% of the Closing Date Payment set forth
               in Section 2.02 (b) (i) (the "Escrow Amount") shall be delivered
               by wire transfer of immediately available funds, free of any bank
               charges, to an Escrow Agent reasonably acceptable to the Parties.
               The Escrow Amount shall solely serve to satisfy indemnification
               claims of the Purchaser against the Sellers for a breach of the
               Representations and Warranties and the Covenants set forth in
               this Agreement. The rights and obligations of the Parties as well
               as the rights and obligations of the Escrow Agent with respect to
               the Escrow Amount shall be set forth in an Escrow Agreement (the
               "Escrow Agreement"), which will be negotiated in good faith and
               the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to conclude
               the Escrow Agreement as soon as practicable. If the Escrow
               Agreement is not put in place when the Closing Conditions are
               reasonably likely to be satisfied within the next ten days, then
               an appropriate neutral expert shall be appointed by the Parties
               and be requested to stipulate the then open issues on the Escrow
               Agreement within three days of his appointment. If the Parties
               cannot agree upon an appropriate neutral expert within three
               business days, such expert shall be appointed, upon request of
               one of the Parties, by the President of the Notary's Chamber in
               Berlin. The expert shall be deemed to be commissioned by both
               Parties and the Parties shall pay the experts costs in equal
               shares. The escrow created by the Escrow Agreement shall subsist
               for 18 months. Any release of the Escrow Amount shall only be
               made in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The provisions set
               forth in the Escrow Agreement shall prevail over the provisions
               of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers
               shall be entitled at any time to replace the Escrow Amount partly
               or in whole by a irrevocable, unconditional bank guarantee
               unlimited in time of a bank reasonably satisfactory to the
               Purchaser in a corresponding amount.

               (ii) If the Purchaser has not obtained the Financing in
          accordance with Section 2.02 (b) (i) above and therefore will pay the
          Closing Consideration Payment as set forth in Section 2.02 (b) (ii),
          the Purchaser shall

                    (aa) deliver to the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
               available funds, free of any bank charges, to a bank account
               designated by KPMG DTG to the Purchaser on behalf of all Sellers
               with written notice given at least five Business Days prior to
               the Closing Date (the

                                      -26-

<PAGE>

               "Omnibus Account"), an amount equal to the Closing Date Cash
               Amount set forth in Section 2.02 (b) (ii) (aa);

                     (bb) issue, convey, assign, transfer and deliver all the
               Exchange Shares to be delivered hereunder (the "Non Escrowed
               Exchange Shares") other than those covered by (cc) below to KPMG
               DTG (on behalf of all the Sellers). In the event that multiplying
               the percentages of each of the Sellers set forth in Schedule 7.01
               (c) by the total number of Exchange Shares so to be issued
               produces a fraction, in lieu of delivering a fractional share,
               the Purchaser will pay to KPMG DTG on behalf of each Seller
               otherwise entitled to a fractional Exchange Share, an amount in
               cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Common Stock Price
               as of Closing. With respect to such cash payment, the foregoing
               sub-paragraph (aa) above shall apply analogously.

                     (cc) issue, convey, assign, transfer and deliver such
               number of Exchange Shares (the "Escrowed Exchange Shares") to the
               Escrow Agent as when valued at USD 16.09 per share would equal in
               value 10 % of the Closing Date Payment (rounded up to the next
               whole share) (calculated as if the Closing Date Payment rather
               than the Closing Consideration Payment were being made). The
               Escrowed Exchange Shares shall solely serve to satisfy
               indemnification claims of the Purchaser against the Sellers for a
               breach of the Representations and Warranties and the Covenants
               set forth in this Agreement. The rights and obligations of the
               Parties and the rights and obligations of the Escrow Agent with
               respect to the Escrowed Exchange Shares shall also be set forth
               in the Escrow Agreement described in Section 6.02 (d) (i) (bb).
               Any release of the Escrowed Exchange Shares shall only be made in
               accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The provisions set forth in
               the Escrow Agreement shall prevail over the provisions of this
               Agreement. With respect to the bank guarantee, Section 6.02 (d)
               (i) (bb) shall apply accordingly.

               (iii) Subject to any portion of the Closing Date Payment or the
          Exchange Shares to be placed into Escrow under the provisions set
          forth in Section 6.02 (d) (i) or (ii) above and in the Escrow
          Agreement and subject to any internal escrow arrangements among the
          Sellers, the Final Purchase Price or, in the case of section 6.02 (d)
          (ii) above, the cash component thereof shall be distributed to all
          Sellers entitled thereto (and to the Blaschitz Shareholders) less any
          costs connected with this Agreement and the auction process leading
          thereto, to the extent that they shall be borne by the Sellers and not
          by the Purchaser or the Company.

          (e) Transfer of Company Shares. The Sellers shall assign to the
     Purchaser their Company Shares and KPMG DTG shall hand over to the
     Purchaser the Company

                                      -27-

<PAGE>

     Share Certificates to the Purchaser in order to effect the transfer of the
     Company Shares to the Purchaser;

          (f) Resignation of Supervisory Board Members. The Sellers shall
     deliver to the Purchaser written declarations showing the resignation of
     all members of the supervisory board of the Company who are not Employee
     Representatives and any members of the advisory board (Beirat) of any of
     the Group Companies.

          (g) Management Board Consent. The Sellers shall deliver evidence of
     the consent of the Company's management board (Vorstand) to the transfer of
     the Company's Shares under the Articles of Association.

          (h) Other Actions. The Parties shall take all further actions and
     measures required under Applicable Law and make all necessary declarations
     and deliver all other documents to be delivered under this Agreement at or
     prior to Closing that have not been previously delivered in order to effect
     the Closing Date Payment or the Closing Consideration Payment, as the case
     may be, the issuance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Exchange
     Shares and the assignment, transfer and delivery of the Company Shares and
     the Claim.

          Section 6.03 Condition Precedent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
transfer of the Company Shares as set forth above shall be subject to the
condition precedent (aufschiebende Bedingung) (the "Condition Precedent") that
the entire Purchase Price has been paid in the manner set forth in Section 6.02
(d) above (Payment of Purchase Price) by the time of the Closing. The Sellers
may, at their sole discretion and at any time prior, on, or after the Closing
waive the Condition Precedent by making a corresponding declaration in written
form vis-a-vis the Purchaser. However, in such case, the Purchase Price
outstanding at that time shall bear interest at a rate of 5% over the base
interest rate of the European Central Bank in terms of Section 247 para. 2
German Civil Code (BGB) (Basiszinssatz) for the period between the Closing Date
and the date on which the entire Purchase Price is paid in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 6.02 (d) (Payment of Purchase Price) above.
Sections 323 and 325 German Civil Code (BGB) shall apply with regard to delivery
of the Company Shares and the Payment of the Closing Date Payment or the Closing
Consideration Payment, as the case may be. The Sellers shall notify the
Purchaser in writing about the occurrence of the Condition Precedent without
delay.

          Section 6.04 Acknowledgement. In the event that the Purchase Price
will be paid partly with Equity Consideration according to Section 2.02 (b) (ii)
above, each Seller will at Closing:

          (a) understand that the Exchange Shares he/she/it is receiving
     hereunder are "restricted securities" under the United States federal
     securities laws as they are being acquired in a transaction not involving a
     public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such
     Exchange Shares may be resold without registration under

                                      -28-

       the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), only in
       certain limited circumstances.

              (b) certify that he/she/it is not a U.S. person and is not
       acquiring the Exchange Shares for the account or benefit of any U.S.
       person, provided that a maximum number of 10 such persons need not so
       certify. For the purposes of this Section, "U.S. person" has the meaning
       set forth in Regulation S of the Securities Act and includes, among
       others, any natural person resident in the U.S. and any partnership or
       corporation organized or incorporated under the laws of the U.S.

              (c) agree to resell the Exchange Shares only in accordance with
       the provisions of Regulation S of the Securities Act, pursuant to a
       registration statement under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an
       available exemption from registration requirements; and agree not to
       engage in hedging transactions prohibited by the Securities Act with
       regard to the Exchange Shares.

              (d) acknowledge that each certificate for the Exchange Shares
       shall be imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:

              "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
              THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "U.S.
              SECURITIES ACT"). THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING SUCH
              SECURITIES, AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ISSUER THAT SUCH
              SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED (A) IN
              ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, (B)

              REGISTRATION AFTER PROVIDING A LEGAL OPINION FROM NATIONALLY

any provisions of this Agreement relating to the consequences of a breach of any

an integral part of this abstract guarantee ("Inhalt des Schuldverhaltnisses" /

         Company's Audited Consolidated Interim Financial Statements which are
         attached as Schedule 7.03 A and B, (hereinafter collectively the
         "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been prepared in
         accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
         States of America ("US-GAAP"), applied on a consistent basis with the
         basis applied in preparing the Company's audited consolidated financial
         statements for the preceding financial period. As of the date hereof,
         the Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects the
         consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the
         Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof or
         the periods covered thereby. In the event of any dispute as to the
         accuracy of this Representation and Warranty, any arbitrator shall
         apply US-GAAP on a basis consistent with the past practices, policies,
         assumptions and estimates of the Company unless such consistent
         practices, policies, assumptions and estimates are not permitted under
         US-GAAP. As a further elaboration of the principle set forth above, the
         Purchaser may not challenge the accuracy of this Representation and
         Warranty alleging that the carrying value of the Company's interest in
         KCF or KCS was lower than that set forth in any of the financial
         statements or that the assumptions regarding projected benefit
         obligations set forth therein are incorrect or should be modified in
         any respect.

                 (b) To the actual knowledge of the board members of the

         material respects the financial situation and results of operations of
         KPMG Consulting Spain S.L., Madrid, Spanien for the period ended on
         December 31, 2001. To the actual knowledge of the board members of the
         Company, neither the

      the audited financial statements for the French branch of KCF do not
      fairly present in all material respects the assets and liabilities as of
      September 30, 2000 and the income and expenses for the period then ended.

            (c) The management accounts of the Company for the month of April,
      2002, contained in the Data Room have been prepared by the management of
      the Company in good faith on a basis consistent with the monthly reports

      whose agreements with the Company are reasonably likely to create an

                  Section 9.01      Survival.

                  (a) Each Party's claims due to a breach of Representations and
         Warranties and the Covenants to be complied with prior to the Closing
         shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until 18
         months after the Closing Date, except for the Representations and

         liability claim under (a) within 6 weeks of the Purchaser actually
         becoming aware of third party claims alleged or of damages due to a

Covenants set forth in this Agreement is not complied with the Sellers shall
initially bring about the situation or an economically equivalent situation to

not possible or reasonable or if such situation is not brought about even after
the expiration of a reasonable grace period, the Sellers shall compensate the
Purchaser for all damages pursuant to the following provisions which would not
have been incurred had the breach of the obligation not occurred. In the case of
Representations or Warranties, this applies regardless of whether or not the

         "Deductible"). The Sellers' maximum liability for any claims by the
         Purchaser shall in any case be limited to 40% of the Base Purchase
         Price (i.e. USD 268,065,800 - in words: United States Dollars two
         hundred sixty eight million sixty five thousand eight hundred), unless
         such limitation is prohibited by mandatory law.

                  (b) In the event that the Purchaser is entitled to demand
         damages pursuant to this Agreement, the Sellers may, at their option,
         satisfy the claim for damages (i) through cash payment; (ii) at any
         time within the first year starting with the Closing Date through
         return of a portion of the Exchange Shares accepted as part of the
         Purchase Price under Section 2.02 of this Agreement, whereby the
         precise number of shares to be returned shall be calculated by using a
         value of USD 16.09 per Exchange Share or (iii) through any combination
         of (i) and (ii).

                  (c) Each Seller - except for KPMG DTG who shall be jointly and
         severally liable (gesamtschuldnerische Haftung) - shall only be liable

         sold by all Sellers set forth in such table (teilschuldnerische

                  the Net Adjustment; or

                           (iii) the damage arising from the incorrectness or
                  incompleteness of the Representation and Warranty is covered
                  by a valid and enforceable claim under insurance held by the
                  Company or its Subsidiaries which the Company

                  to the Company or its Subsidiaries after 31 December 2001 or
                  from or by the passage of any legislation, or enactment of any

                  Agreement; or

                           (v)   the damage incurred by the Purchaser or the
                  Company or its Subsidiaries arises from or is increased by an
                  increase in the rates, method of calculation or scope of
                  taxation after 31 December 2001; or

                  advantages; or

                           (vii) after the Closing Date, the Company, its
                  Subsidiaries or the Purchaser did not do or did not refrain
                  from doing what a prudent businessman would have done or
                  refrained from doing in order to avert or prevent the damage
                  (Schadensminderungspflicht).

                  (e) With the exception of the Representations and Warranties
         expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Sellers do not make any
         representations or warranties of any nature to the Purchaser in respect
         of the legal or commercial conditions of the Company or its
         Subsidiaries or otherwise; in particular, the Sellers do not make any
         representations or warranties as to the continuation of the current

                  (g) In case of a breach of the tax Representation and Warranty

                                 -   are subject of a valid and enforceable
                           claim for repayment or indemnification against a
                           third party (including Partners and other employees
                           of the Company and/or the Companies Subsidiaries); or

                                 -   are the result of a reorganization
                           contemplated or initiated by Purchaser.

                           (ii)  Tax reduction and future tax benefits. Sellers
                  shall be entitled to compensation by the Purchaser for future
                  Tax benefits obtained by the Purchaser, the Company or its
                  Subsidiaries, if and to the extent that:

                                 -   Tax assessments regarding the Sellers, the
                           Company and the Group Companies for taxable
                           (assessment) periods ending on or before the December
                           31, 2001 are amended, especially by Tax audit, and
                           such amendments will cause future tax reductions
                           (Steuerminderungen), e.g. by the increase of
                           acquisition costs of assets reflected in the
                           respective balance sheet which the Purchaser, the
                           Company and/or the Com-

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

               pany's Subsidiaries (or their successors) would not have obtained
               otherwise; or;

                      -   amendments pursuant to the preceding sub-paragraph
               create Tax carry backs or carry forwards, which the Purchaser,
               Company or the Group companies may use.

               (iii)  Tax Reductions. Tax reductions and/or benefits which the
       Purchaser, Company and/or any of its affiliates achieve in accordance
       with the aforesaid shall reduce the indemnity up to or, respectively,
       give Sellers a claim against the Purchaser of an amount equal to their
       net present value, based on (i) the assumption of immediate use of Tax
       loss carry backs or loss carry forwards, (ii) the estimated Tax rate
       applicable at such time to the respective company concerned, and (iii)
       with the net present value being calculated using an interest rate of 5%
       p.a. (30/360 days).

               (viii) Indemnification Payments. Indemnification payments by the
       Sellers due under this Section 9.02. (g) shall be made within 20 Business
       Days following written notice by the Purchaser, provided that the payment
       of such amounts to the Authority is due, and, further provided that the
       Sellers shall not be required to make any payment earlier than 2 Business
       Days before such Taxes are due to the Authority. In case of any Tax being
       contested in accordance with Section 9.02. (g), payment of such Tax to
       the authority will be considered due no earlier than on the date a final
       (bestandskraftig) determination to such effect is made by either the
       Authority or a court of proper jurisdiction, provided that the competent
       Authority has granted relief from paying the assessed Tax until such Tax
       becomes final and binding. If this is not the case, the Sellers shall
       make a respective advance indemnification payment to the Purchaser, and
       if the final amount to be indemnified for Taxes and to be paid by the
       Sellers is lower than the advance indemnification payment by such
       Sellers, then the difference shall be reimbursed by the Purchaser,
       including all interest earned thereon, if any. If and to the extent that
       compensation claims of the Sellers exceed indemnification claims of the
       Purchaser, or cannot be off-set against indemnification claims of the
       Purchaser for other reasons (e.g. timing), the Purchaser shall pay to the
       Sellers the respective amounts within 20 Business Days after the
       respective Tax assessment or Tax settlement notice (Abrechnungsbescheid)
       from which such indemnification claims result has been issued.

               (ix)   Tax Refunds and Credit. The Purchaser shall promptly pay
       to the Sellers any Tax refund and Tax credit (both including any interest
       paid or credited with respect thereto) realized or received by the
       Purchaser after January 01, 2002 (i) relating to the Company and its
       Subsidiaries for taxable (assessment) periods or portions thereof ending
       on or before December 31, 2001, or (ii) attributable to an amount paid by
       the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.02. (g) the Purchaser shall procure the
       filing for, and obtaining of, any Tax refund or Tax credit to which the
       Sellers may be entitled under this Section 9.02. (g). The

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

       Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers are permitted to control the
       enforcement of such Tax refund or Tax credit claim, and shall authorize,
       or cause its affiliates or Subsidiaries to authorize, by appropriate
       power-of-attorney such person(s) as the Sellers designate to represent
       such entity with respect to such claim. A Tax refund is to be considered
       realized for the purposes of this Agreement at the time that it is
       received in cash or cash equivalent, and a Tax credit is deemed being
       realized if reflected in a Tax assessment or Tax settlement notice
       (Abrechnungsbescheid).

               (x)    Indemnification of the Sellers. The Purchaser shall be
       responsible for and hold the Sellers harmless against any Taxes relating
       to or attributable to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their assets or
       their operations of their businesses attributable to all taxable periods
       beginning on or after January 1, 2002.

               (xi)   Allocation of VAT. With a view to the fact that the tax
       consolidations for VAT purposes between the Company and KPMG DTG will
       terminate on Closing, the compensation for VAT purposes relating to the
       Company and accruing for the period until Closing shall be calculated as
       follows. The Company shall set up a balance showing all amounts of VAT
       payable (geschuldete Umsatzsteuer) and of input VAT
       (Vorsteuerabzugsbetrage) accruing for the period until Closing and
       relating to its business. If the balance shows a surplus of input VAT,
       the Sellers shall pay such balance to the Purchaser or, at the election
       of the Purchaser, to the Company to the extent the Sellers have not yet
       fulfilled such obligation vis-a-vis the Company until Closing. If the
       balance shows a surplus of VAT payable, the Purchaser shall pay an amount
       equal to such balance to the Sellers. The same applies to the extent the
       balance is affected by amendments of a Tax audit or by any other
       comparable event.

               (xii)  Proceedings. The Sellers agree to ensure the preparation
       and filing of all Tax returns of Company and its Subsidiaries for any
       taxable (assessment) period ending on or before December 31, 2001. The
       Purchaser shall give to the Sellers full information and full access to
       the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxable
       (assessment) periods until and including to theDecember 31, 2001, and
       shall procure that the Company and its Subsidiaries file Tax returns for
       taxable (assessment) periods including to December 31, 2001 in accordance
       with instructions from, and the prior written consent of, the Sellers.
       Tax returns for periods including to December 31, 2001 shall be prepared
       on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable (assessment)
       periods. The Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers are provided with a
       copy of such completed return at least 25 Business Days prior to the due
       date for the filing of such return, and the Sellers shall have the right
       to review such return and statement prior to the filing thereof. The
       Purchaser undertakes to consult with the Sellers and to attempt in good
       faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such
       return and statement by the Sellers. The aforesaid shall also apply as
       far as adjustments on transfer pricing or VAT, if

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

       any, are concerned which may give rise to an indemnification by the
       Sellers. The Purchaser further undertakes to immediately provide to the
       Sellers all information relevant for the calculation of Tax reductions or
       future Tax benefits, in any event within 15 Business Days after the
       request of the Sellers, and grant to the Sellers access to the books and
       records of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably required in order
       to review and verify such Tax reductions or future Tax benefits.

               (xiii) Notification. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
       promptly notify the Sellers upon learning of the commencement of any Tax
       audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that, if determined
       adversely to the Tax payer or after the lapse of time, would constitute a
       basis for indemnification by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 9.02.
       (g). Such notice shall be in writing and shall contain factual
       information describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail
       and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from
       any Tax authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. The
       Purchaser shall further procure that the Company and its Subsidiaries
       allow the Sellers to fully participate in such auditing process. If the
       Sellers are not given prompt notice as required before, then the Sellers
       shall not have any obligation to indemnify the Purchaser for any loss
       arising out of such asserted Tax liability.

               (xiv)  Contest. The Sellers may elect to direct themselves or
       through counsel of their own choice and at their expense, any audit,
       claim for refund and administrative or judicial proceeding involving any
       asserted liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought under
       this Section 9.02. (g) (any such audit, claim for refund or proceeding
       relating to an asserted Tax liability being referred to herein as
       "Contest"). If the Sellers elect to direct a Contest, then the Sellers
       shall within 25 Business Days of receipt of the Purchaser's notice of an
       asserted Tax liability, notify the Purchaser of their intent to do so,
       and the Purchaser shall co-operate and cause the Company and its
       Subsidiaries or their respective successors to co-operate, at the
       Sellers' expense in each phase of such Contest. If the Sellers do not
       elect to direct such Contest or fail to notify the Purchaser of their
       election as herein provided, the Purchaser, the Company or the respective
       Subsidiary of the Company may pay, compromise or contest such asserted
       Tax liability; provided that neither the Purchaser nor the Company or the
       respective Group Companies may settle or compromise any asserted Tax
       liability in spite of the objection of the Sellers. In any event, the
       Sellers may participate, at their own expense, in any contest. If the
       Sellers choose to direct the Contest, the Purchaser shall promptly
       authorize, and shall cause the Company or the respective Group Company to
       authorize, (by power-of-attorney and such other documentation as may be
       necessary and appropriate) the designated representative of the Sellers
       to represent the Purchaser and/or the Company or the respective
       Subsidiary of the Company or their successor in the Contest insofar as
       the Contest involves an asserted Tax liability for which the Sellers
       would be liable under this Section 9.02. (g).

       except for its obligation to pay the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
       2.02 above, for any claims by the Sellers arising out of the transactions
       contemplated by this Agreement shall in any case be limited to 65 % of
       the Base Purchase Price (USD 435,606,925 - in words: United States
       Dollars four hundred thirty five million six hundred and six thousand
       nine hundred and twenty five), unless such limitation is prohibited by
       mandatory law.

release it to the individual Sellers in accordance with Schedule 7.01 (c)

claims of the Purchaser as of the end of the 19 month period.

                  Section 10.04 Access to Information After Closing. To the
extent such information is reasonably requested to satisfy legal or stock

                  to all obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement;

                         (ii)  any rights of the Sellers to set-off liabilities
                  against claims of the Purchaser shall not be affected; and

                         (iii) the assignment shall in no way operate so as to
                  increase or reduce the respective rights and obligation on the
                  part of the Purchaser or its assignee on the one hand and the
                  Sellers on the other hand.

                  (b) Except for the exemption set forth under (a) above, no
         Party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights under this
         Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party hereto,
