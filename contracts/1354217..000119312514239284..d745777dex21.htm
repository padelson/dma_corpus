(a) _Company Options_. The Company shall send a notice (the " _Option Notice_

Company  

 



-24-  Securityholder Distribution and (iii) in the event that any Milestone

of such Company Option, _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share Milestone

Consideration to each holder of Company Options as described in this Section
2.7(a) shall be reduced by any income or employment tax withholding required
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
withheld pursuant to the preceding sentence, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder

and extinguished without the right to receive any consideration therefor, and
each of the Company Warrants that is an In-the-Money Company Warrant will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into and represent the
right to receive (without interest) a cash payment in an amount equal to (i)

delivered by the Stockholders Representative prior to the payment of the
applicable Milestone Consideration in accordance with Section 6.11 (the "
_Milestone Warrant Payout Amount_ "). Within one (1) Business Day after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to each
holder of Company Warrants a notice in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B (which notice shall correspond with the shares of Company Capital
Stock subject to such Company Warrant) (as applicable, a " _Warrant Consent_
") regarding the Merger and the other transactions

 



-25-  contemplated hereby. Promptly after execution and delivery of this
Agreement, but in any event prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to
Parent a Warrant Consent duly executed by the holder of each Company Warrant
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Company Convertible Notes_. The Company will take all necessary and
appropriate action so that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each

of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates or an
instrument or instruments (the " _Certificates_ "), which immediately prior to

2.7(c): (A) a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are
reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable
portion of the Closing Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide to any Company Securityholder who is to receive in

upon the written or email request of such holder (or the Company on behalf of
such holder), a letter of transmittal, and any such holder who shall deliver
a duly completed letter of transmittal and the other items set forth in this
Section 2.8(d) to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Closing Date shall
receive the amounts of Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to

Date. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly

 



-27-  completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto

the holder of record of such Certificates (unless such Certificates represent
Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash, without interest, constituting the Closing Merger
Consideration such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6 and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. At the election of
the respective Company Securityholder, the Exchange Agent shall make the
foregoing payment by wire transfer to the extent that the aggregate amount
owed to any such holder at the Closing is in excess of $1,000,000. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates (other than those representing
Dissenting Shares, unless the holder thereof loses its right to appraisal)
will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes,
to evidence the right to receive the Closing Merger Consideration into which
such securities shall have been so converted.

 

(d) _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow
Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock, Company
Convertible Notes, Company Options or Company Warrants such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or otherwise
under any other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 3.2(d)).
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to
the appropriate taxing authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person (as defined in
Section 10.4(d)) to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.8, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of the Companys securities pursuant to this Article II. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to holders of
the Companys securities pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the

 



-28-  Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of the
Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 2.8 shall after
such delivery to the Surviving Corporation look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for the amount of cash constituting the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Sections 2.6(a), 2.6(b) and 2.7 with respect to the
shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants formerly
represented thereby. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.3(c)), any
such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of the
Companys securities immediately prior to such time shall, to the extent
permitted by law, become the property of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The amounts
paid in respect of Company Capital Stock, Company Convertible Notes, Company
Options and Company Warrants in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Convertible Notes, Company Options
and Company Warrants, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital
Stock, Company Convertible Notes and Company Warrants which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the delivery of an agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent pursuant to which such Person
agrees to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, subject to Section 2.8(c), pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed Certificate
the amount of Merger Consideration such Person would have been entitled to
receive had such Person surrendered such lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or
destroyed Company Certificate to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section
2.8(c).

 

2.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company and Merger 

 



-29-  Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

 

2.12 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Not less than three (3) Business Days nor more than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the "
_Estimated Closing Certificate_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail, (i)
the proposed balance sheet of the Company as of the close of business on the
anticipated Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, (ii) the Companys estimate
of the Company Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount_ ") and the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount is greater than or less than the Target Net Working Capital (such
amount, if greater than the Target Net Working Capital, the " _Estimated
Working Capital Surplus_ " and, if less than the Target Net Working Capital,
the " _Estimated Working Capital Deficit_ "), (iii) the Companys estimate of
Indebtedness as of the anticipated Effective Time (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ ") and the amount, if any, by which the Indebtedness is greater
than $0 (the " _Net Indebtedness Adjustment_ "), and (iv) the Companys
estimate of its unpaid Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction
Expenses_ "), and the calculation of the Merger Consideration based thereon.
The Estimated Closing Certificate and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
shall be in forms reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 

(b) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing, Parent may object
to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Company Net Working
Capital, Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Transaction Expenses
calculations included in the Estimated Closing Certificate, by delivering to
the Securityholders Representative a statement setting forth (the " _Parent
Closing Statement_ ") (i) a balance sheet as of the close of business on the
Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (the "
_Parent Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) Parents calculation of the
Company Net Working Capital (the " _Proposed Net Working Capital Amount_ "),
Indebtedness as of the Closing (the " _Proposed Indebtedness_ "), and
Transaction Expenses of the Company (the " _Proposed Transaction Expenses_ ")
and the amount by which the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount is greater or
less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount (if applicable), the
amount by which the Proposed Indebtedness is greater or less than the
Estimated Indebtedness (if applicable), and the amount by which the Proposed
Transaction Expenses is greater or less than the Estimated Transaction
Expenses (if applicable).

(c) If the Securityholders Representative disagrees with the Parent
Closing Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working Capital Amount, Proposed
Indebtedness,

 



-30-  and/or Proposed Transaction Expenses, the Securityholders Representative
shall notify Parent of his objections within thirty (30) Business Days after
delivery of the Parent Closing Statement and shall set forth in reasonable
detail in such notice the reason for its objections. If the Securityholders
Representative fails to deliver such notice within such time period, the
Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, shall
be deemed to have accepted the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount, Proposed Indebtedness,
Proposed Transaction Expenses, and Proposed Change of Control Payments, which
shall be final and binding for all purposes hereunder. If the Securityholders
Representative timely delivers such notice, Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve their dispute over the
determination of the Parent Closing Balance Sheet, Proposed Net Working
Capital Amount, Proposed Indebtedness, and Proposed Transaction Expenses
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice by Parent. If, at
the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such dispute, then the
Independent Accountant shall resolve the dispute within twenty (20) Business
Days. The decision of the Independent Accountant as to the balance sheet of
the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "),
Company Net Working Capital, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses as of the
Closing Date shall be final and binding upon the parties and the Company
Securityholders, and the expense of the Independent Accountant shall be borne
by Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Securityholders, on the other
hand, in proportion to the relative difference between such partys position
and the determination of such Independent Accountant (and such allocation of
fees shall be determined by the Independent Accountant in accordance
herewith).

 

(d) Within three (3) Business Days following the date on which the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Company Net Working Capital is finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.12(c) hereof (the final Closing Balance Sheet being the
" _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the finally determined amount of Company
Net Working Capital being the " _Final Net Working Capital Amount_ "), the
Indebtedness as of the Closing Date is finally determined pursuant to Section
2.12(c) hereof (the finally determined amount being the " _Final
Indebtedness_ "), the Transaction Expenses of the Company are finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.12(c) hereof (the finally determined amount
being the " _Final Transaction Expenses_ "):

(i) If the Final Adjustment is a negative number, then Parent and
the Securityholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice executed by both such parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Parent from the Escrow Fund cash equal to the absolute value of
the Final Adjustment and to the Independent Accountant (or to Parent if
Parent has already paid all of the fees of the

 



-31-  Independent Accountant) the fees of the Independent Accountant payable by
the Company Securityholders pursuant to Section 2.12(c) hereof.

 

(ii) If the Final Adjustment is a positive number, then Parent shall
deliver cash equal to a portion of the absolute value of the Final Adjustment
to (x) the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders (other than the Company Option Holders) and (y) to the Company
for further distribution to the Company Option Holders, in each case, in
accordance with the Payment Schedule (as updated by the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to _Section 6.11_), and Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written
notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to
the Independent Accountant (or to Parent if Parent has already paid all of the
fees of the Independent Accountant) the fees of the Independent
Accountant payable by the Company Securityholders pursuant to Section 2.12(c)
hereof.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Adjustment_ " shall be equal to the
sum of: (i) the positive amount by which the Final Net Working Capital Amount
is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount or the negative
amount by which the Final Net Working Capital Amount is less than the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, as applicable, (ii) the positive amount
by which the Estimated Indebtedness is greater than the Final Indebtedness or
the negative amount by which the Estimated Indebtedness is less than the
Final Indebtedness, as applicable, and (iii) the positive amount by which the
Estimated Transaction Expenses are greater than the Final Transaction Expenses
or the negative amount by which the Estimated Transaction Expenses are less
than the Final Transaction Expenses. By way of illustration: if the Final Net
Working Capital Amount was calculated to be $50,000 and the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount is determined to be $100,000, the Estimated
Indebtedness was calculated to be $5,000 and the Final Indebtedness is
determined to be $20,000, and the Estimated Transaction Expenses was

(c) Parent shall act in good faith and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to achieve the Regulatory Milestone and to develop and commercialize the
Company Products (other than the CRE Excluded Products); _provided_ ,
_however_ , the obligation of Parent to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to

shall not be deemed a guarantee that any Milestone Consideration will be
earned; _provided_ , _further_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to
either develop of commercialize the CRE Excluded Products. Other than with
respect to Parents obligations set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 2.13(c), the parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to the
operation of the Surviving Corporation, and the use of the assets, properties
and interests acquired from the Company by Parent pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby, as well as the remainder of Parents business or
assets, Parent may act in the best interests of Parent without regard to the

realized, in whole or in part, by the Company Securityholders; and (ii)
Parent and its directors, officers, employers and agents owe no fiduciary duty
to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Securityholders with
respect to the Milestone Consideration.

*** ] percent ([ *** ]%) (i.e, does not fulfill [ *** ] percent ([ *** ]%) or
more) of the orders for a Company Product received by Parent, its Affiliates,
Licensees or distributors during any calendar quarter in accordance with
the terms of such orders (such failure, a " _Failure to Supply_ "), Parent
shall promptly provide the Securityholders Representative with written notice
of such Failure to Supply, and the Securityholders Representative shall have
the right to toll the Milestone Period in which such Failure to Supply
occurred with respect to such Company Product until such Failure to Supply has
been cured (the period during which such Milestone Period is tolled, which
shall commence on the first day of the month following the date on which such
notice is given and shall end on the last day of the month in which the
Failure to Supply is cured, the " _Toll Period_ "); provided, however, that if
such Failure to Supply occurs prior the Manufacturing Move Date, the
Securityholders Representative shall only have the right to toll the
Milestone Period under this Section 2.13(d) if at least [ *** ] of the [ ***
] Company Employees listed on Section 2.13(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter were employed by Parent or any of its Affiliates at the time of

 



-34- 

 

***Confidential Treatment Requested  such Failure to Supply. In the event the Securityholders Representative so
tolls a fiscal year with respect to a Company Product in accordance with the
prior sentence, Parent shall not pay any Milestone Consideration for such
Company Product during the Toll Period, and the Milestone Period for such
Company Product shall be extended by a time period equal to Toll Period.
Parent shall keep the Securityholders Representative fully informed with
respect to Parents progress toward curing a Failure to Supply during any Toll
Period, including by providing the Securityholders Representative with a
monthly written report of the quantity of orders received for such Company
Product and the percentage of such orders that are fulfilled by Parent or its
designee.

 

(e) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of each of the first
three calendar quarters during the Milestone Period, Parent shall provide to
the Securityholders Representative a report of the revenue, calculated in

quarter on a country-by-country basis.

(f) Parent shall maintain complete and accurate records of its Cumulative
Cash Sales and calculation of the Milestone Consideration for each Company
Product for a period of three (3) years after the end of the quarter to which
such records pertain. The Securityholders Representative shall have the right
to audit such records, provided that the three (3) year retention period for
such records being audited has not expired and provided that in no event may
the Securityholders Representative conduct more than one audit per calendar
year pursuant to this Section 2.13(f) (regardless of the number of then-
applicable Company Products), upon reasonable notice to Parent, to confirm
that the Milestone Consideration paid by Parent are correct. Any such audits
shall be conducted at the Securityholders Representative expense (solely on
behalf of the Company Securityholders), unless the results of such audit
reveal an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) (for all Milestone
Consideration for all Company Products in aggregate) for any period that is
the subject of such audit, in which case Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Securityholders Representative for the costs of such audit.

 

(g) The Securityholders Representative and each Permitted Recipient (i)
shall hold in confidence and shall not disclose to any other Person all
information provided to it pursuant to this Section 2.13 except as permitted
under this Section 2.13(g) or to the extent that such information can be shown
to have been in the public domain through no fault of the Securityholders
Representative, any Permitted Recipient or any of their respective Affiliates
and (ii) shall not use such information other than solely to assess the value
of, the progress towards, and the probability of, obtaining the Milestone
Consideration and to determine or enforce any and all of the Company
Securityholders rights under this Agreement, including the right to receive
such Milestone Consideration;  _provided_ that the Securityholders
Representative may disclose such information to the Permitted Recipients so
long as each such Permitted Recipient (A) is informed of the

 



-35-  confidential nature of such information and (B) is bound by and owes the
Securityholders Representative a duty of confidentiality pursuant to
applicable law with respect to such information or executes a confidentiality
agreement with the Securityholders Representative regarding such information
(1) that is comparable to and no less restrictive than the terms of this
Section 2.13(g) with respect to the Securityholders Representative, (2)
contains the acknowledgement and agreement referred to in the penultimate
sentence of this Section 2.13(g) and (3) to which Parent is made an express
third party beneficiary. At the request of Parent, the Securityholders
Representative shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to Parent, true and
correct copies of each such confidentiality agreement except to the extent any
such delivery would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of itself or the Company
Securityholders). Any Permitted Recipient receiving such information shall not
disclose such information to any Person, including to any prospective or
current limited partner or other investor of such Permitted Recipient;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a Permitted Recipient that is a venture capital
fund or other institutional or strategic investor may, (I) disclose such
information to its auditors for purposes of enabling such auditors to confirm
the reasonableness of the methodology utilized by such venture capital fund in
valuing its expected return from the Merger; _provided_ , that such auditing
firm is subject to reasonable and customary confidentiality obligations
regarding such information, and (II) disclose to prospective and current
limited partners such Company Stockholders share of the total consideration
payable or that may become payable in respect of such Company Stockholders
Company Capital Stock, the valuation such venture capital fund has placed on
its expected return from the Merger and a general statement of the likelihood
that the Milestone Consideration will be received ( _e.g_., a "high
likelihood", a "low likelihood", "a greater or less than 50% likelihood",
etc.) (it being understood that in no event shall such general
statement include any specifics regarding the progress in achieving the
Milestone Consideration that are not generally available publicly). The
Securityholders Representative acknowledges and agrees, and each Permitted
Recipient receiving information of the type described above shall acknowledge
and agree as part of the confidentiality agreement required to be executed by
such Permitted Recipient, that (x) the information provided pursuant to
Section 2.13 may contain material non-public information concerning Parent
and its Affiliates, (y) it shall comply with applicable securities laws
regarding the trading of securities of Parent and its Affiliates while in
possession of any such material non-public information, including any
restrictions imposed by such laws prohibiting any person who has received any
such material non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of
Parent and its Affiliates or from communicating such information to any
other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that
such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities and (z) Parent
is relying upon its compliance with the obligations under this Section 2.13(g)
for purposes of compliance by Parent and its Affiliates with Regulation FD
promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (to the extent
Parent or any of its Affiliates is subject to such regulation). As

 



-36-  used herein, " _Permitted Recipient_ " means each Person listed in Section
2.13(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter or any other Person who is bound by
and owes the Securityholders Representative a duty of confidentiality
pursuant to applicable law.

 

(h) The right of any Company Securityholder to receive its distribution of
the Milestone Consideration: (i) does not give such Company Securityholder
dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights or other
rights of holders of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; (ii) shall
not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument; (iii) other than
pursuant to a Permitted Transfer, shall not be assignable or otherwise
transferable by such Company Securityholder; (iv) shall not accrue or pay
interest on any portion thereof; and does not represent any right other than
the right to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 2.13. Any
attempted transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer) of the right to the
Milestone Consideration by any holder thereof shall be null and void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no Permitted Transfer shall be given effect
unless and until written notice of such Permitted Transfer shall be promptly
delivered to each of Parent and the Securityholders Representative by the
transferor or assignor (or such transferors or assignors estate), which
notice shall expressly set forth the transferor or assignor and the transferee
or assignee, the rights to which such transfer or assignment related and
the effective date of such transfer, and the parties to such transfer or
assignment shall agree to provide to each of Parent and the Securityholders
Representative, at their respective request, any additional evidence of the
transfer or assignment that Parent or the Securityholders Representative, as
the case may be, may reasonably request, and (B) no such Permitted Transfer
shall be valid if (x) the right to receive a portion of the Milestone
Consideration constitutes a security under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and (y) such Permitted Transfer, individually or taken together with
any prior transfer or assignment and any potential future transfers or
assignments and other facts and circumstances, cannot be accomplished in a
transaction that is exempt from registration and qualification under, or would
result in any other adverse consequences to Parent or its Affiliates under
U.S. federal and state securities laws or any other Legal Requirement.

(i) _Parent Sale/Carve Out Transaction_. In the event that
Parent consummates (i) a Parent Change of Control or (ii) a Carve-Out
Transaction (in the case of either of the foregoing clause (i) or clause (ii),
an " _Acquisition_ ") with a counterparty (the " _Acquiring Entity_ ") who
does not have a Competing Product, Parent shall obligate the Acquiring Entity
to assume all of Parents obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
Company Products subject to all the limitations and qualifications included
in this Agreement with respect to such obligations, including the obligation
to pay to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders (other than Company Option Holders) and to the Company
for further distribution to the Company Option Holders, in each case, the
Revenue Consideration as set forth in Section 2.13(b)

 



-37-  with respect to each Company Product (and, in such event, the parties
acknowledge and agree that Parent shall cease to have any continuing
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Company Products). In
the event of an Acquisition by an Acquiring Entity that does have a Competing
Product, Parent shall require the Acquiring Entity to agree to one of the two
following options (the selection of which shall be at the sole option of the
Acquiring Entity): (1) upon the closing of such Acquisition, pay to the
Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Company Securityholders (other
than the Company Option Holders) and to the Company for further distribution
to the Company Option Holders, as applicable and in accordance with the
Payout Spreadsheet (as updated by the Securityholders Representative pursuant
to _Section 6.11_), a non-refundable aggregate amount (which the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree shall be in full satisfaction of all Milestone
Consideration obligations under this Agreement) equal to the greater of (A) [
*** ]; or (2) assume all of Parents obligations with respect to the
Company Products under this Agreement, subject to all the limitations and
qualifications included in this Agreement with respect to such obligations,
including Parents obligation to pay to the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Company Securityholders (other than the Company Option
Holders) and to the Company for further distribution to the Company Option
Holders, as applicable, the Revenue Consideration owed in accordance with
Section 2.13(b) on Cumulative Cash Sales of the Company Products (and, in
such event, the parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall cease to have
any continuing obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Company
Products) and to agree to pay to the Exchange Agent for further distribution
to the Company Securityholders (other than the Company Option Holders) and to
the Company for further distribution to the Company Option Holders, as
applicable and in accordance with the Payout Schedule (as updated by
the Securityholders Representative pursuant to _Section 6.11_), an amount
corresponding to the Revenue Consideration with respect to sales of the
Acquiring Entitys Competing Products (as if the Acquiring Entitys Competing
Products were the Company Products) for the same periods that would have been
payable for the Company Products. For purposes of this Section 2.13(i), "
_Competing Product_ " means, with respect to a Company Product, [ *** ]. For
purposes of this Section 2.13(j), the " _Total Acquisition Product Payout
Amount_ " shall mean the sum of all Acquisition Product Payout Amounts. For
purposes of this Section 2.13(i), " _Acquisition Product Payout Amount_ "
shall mean for each Company Product, an amount that is calculated as follows:

commitment or provision by which the Company is bound or affected as of
the date hereof, which confidentiality obligation, commitment or provision
shall be disclosed to Parent, _provided_ that disclosure

Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage
applicable to directors and officers as of the Effective Time under the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy; _provided,
however_ , that if such "tail" or other policies are not available at an
annual cost not greater than 250% of the last annual premium paid prior to the

Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Merger and continue until
their expiration at 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the date that is eighteen
months following the Closing Date, except that (i) the IP Representations
shall continue in full force and effect until 5:00 p.m. (California time) on
the three year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) the Fundamental
Representations and the Securityholder Representations shall continue in

 



-84-  full force and effect until the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitations in respect of the matters addressed by such representations and
warranties; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time on or prior to the
Escrow Termination Date, any Indemnified Party delivers to the
Securityholders Representative a Claim Certificate alleging the existence of
an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
Indemnified Partys belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 8.3 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the representation or warranty underlying the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Escrow Termination Date until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved and for the sole purpose
of remaining in effect in order to permit such claim to be fully and finally
resolved. All representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub
shall expire at the Closing. All of the covenants, agreements and obligations
of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive (x) until fully
performed or fulfilled, unless non-compliance with such covenants, agreements
or obligations is waived in writing by the party or parties entitled to such
performance or (y) if not fully performed or fulfilled, until the expiration
of the relevant statute of limitations.

(b) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the
Company, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified

parties hereto agree that for Tax purposes only Parent is the owner of any
cash in the Escrow Fund, and that all interest on or other taxable income, if
any, earned from the investment of such cash pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement shall be the property of Parent and treated for tax purposes
as earned by Parent.

(b) Promptly following the Closing, and without any act of any Company
Securityholder, Parent shall deposit the Representative Reimbursement Amount
in a non-interest bearing account with the Escrow Agent, to be held by the
Escrow Agent and released on the instructions of the Securityholders

at the Closing that has not been used by the 

 



-85-  Securityholders Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on
or prior to the end of the period in which the Indemnified Parties may make
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or, if later, the date
on which all indemnification claims of the Indemnified Parties outstanding at
the end of such period have been discharged in full, shall be released by the
Escrow Agent for distribution by the Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent for
further distribution to the Company Securityholders (other than the Company
Option Holders) and to the Company for further distribution to the Company
Option Holders, in each case, in accordance with the Payment Schedule (as
updated by the Securityholders Representative pursuant to _Section 6.11_).
Notwithstanding the delivery of any remaining portion of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount to the Escrow Agent, such remaining portion shall not be
deemed part of the Escrow Fund and shall not be available to satisfy any
indemnification or other obligations to Parent hereunder. Neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation with respect to
the use of the Representative Reimbursement Amount by the Securityholders
Representative. The parties hereto agree for Tax purposes that the Company
Securityholders shall be treated as receiving the Representative Reserve
Amount when deposited with the Escrow Agent. Any applicable withholding taxes

Holders in respect of their Company Options shall be withheld from their share
of the Closing Merger Consideration when paid through the Companys payroll.

8.3 _Indemnification by Company Securityholders_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date (but subject to Section 8.1), each Company
Securityholder shall severally (based on such Company Securityholders Pro
Rata Portion), but not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Party from and against, and each Indemnified Party shall be compensated,
reimbursed and paid for, any Losses suffered or incurred by each such
Indemnified Party resulting from, or directly or indirectly related to, (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement (determined without regard to any qualification or exception
contained therein relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
or any similar qualification or standard), any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company in this Agreement as of the Closing Date as if such
representation or warranty had been made as of the Closing Date, except for
such representations and warranties that address matters only as of a
particular time, which need be accurate only as of such time (determined, in
each case, without regard to any qualification or exception contained therein
relating to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or any similar
qualification or standard), or any breach of any representation or
warranty of such Company Securityholder of the Securityholder Representations
(determined without regard to any qualification or exception contained therein
relating to materiality or any similar qualification or standard); (ii) any
failure by 

 



-86-  the Company to perform or comply with any covenant of the Company contained
in this Agreement prior to the Closing Date; (iii) any demands by holders of
Company Capital Stock under the DGCL and or the California Corporations Code,
as applicable, but only for fees and costs incurred in connection with
appraisal and or dissenters rights proceedings and the extent, if any, to
which the consideration to be paid to the holders of Dissenting Shares
exceeds the Merger Consideration that otherwise would have been payable with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) any
inaccuracy in the Payment Schedule (as updated by the
Securityholders Representative pursuant to Section 6.11), including the
Companys Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness or the Companys Net Working
Capital that were not considered in the calculation of the Closing Merger

as Current Liabilities in computing Company Net Working Capital (as finally

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to
clause (i) of Section 8.3(a) (that does not involve fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) unless and until the Indemnified Parties have suffered or
incurred Losses in excess of $575,000 in the aggregate (the " _Deductible
Amount_ "), and with respect to any given claim or claims for Losses, such
claim or series of related claims based on the same or similar facts equals or
exceeds $57,500 (the " _Threshold Amount_ " and such Loss, a " _Qualified
Loss_ "), after which the Indemnified Party may make claims for
indemnification for the amount by which the sum of Qualified Losses exceeds
the Deductible Amount, subject to the terms of this Article VIII; _provided_
, _however_ , that neither the Deductible Amount nor the Threshold Amount
shall apply with respect to any Losses resulting from, or directly or
indirectly related to, the Fundamental Representations or the Securityholder
Representations (and for the sake of clarity, any claim under clauses (ii)
through (vii) of Section 8.3(a)), for which matters the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses, subject to the
applicable limitations contained in this Article VIII.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) no claim
may be made for any Loss related to or arising from (A) the amount, value or
condition of

 



-87-  any Tax asset or attribute (including, but not limited to, net operating
loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (B) the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Affiliates to utilize such Tax asset or attribute following the Effective
Time; (ii) the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this Article VIII shall be reduced in amount by any insurance proceeds
actually recovered by any Indemnified Party (net of actual out-of-pocket and
reasonable costs of enforcement, deductibles, premium increases and retro-
premium adjustments related to such Losses), and Parent and the
Indemnified Parties shall, as a condition to receiving any amounts pursuant
to Section 8.3(a)(vi) from the Escrow Fund or otherwise seeking recovery
hereunder, use all commercially reasonable efforts to realize such proceeds;
(iii) no Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII
shall be recoverable hereunder that constitute punitive, unforeseeable or
speculative damages (unless such damages were awarded to a third party
pursuant to a Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification hereunder); and (iv) the amount of any Loss subject to
recovery under this Article VIII shall be calculated net of any amounts
specifically accrued or reserved for in the Final Closing Company Balance
Sheet. All claims for recovery for any Loss shall be made pursuant to and in
accordance with, and be governed by the terms of, this Agreement and, as
applicable, the Escrow Agreement.

 

8.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (a) for breaches of Fundamental Representations
or Securityholder Representations, (b) for claims for indemnity under Section
8.3(a)(ii) through (vii) inclusive and (c) in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company (in which case each Company Securityholder
shall be liable on a several but not joint basis for its Pro Rata Portion of
such Losses (to the extent recovered outside of the Escrow Fund or the setoff
against any payment of Revenue Consideration) in an aggregate amount not to
exceed such Companys Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the Merger
Consideration actually paid, or otherwise deemed earned under the terms of
this Agreement), recovery from the Escrow Fund and setoff against up to twenty
percent (20%) of any payment of Revenue Consideration pursuant to Section
8.11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit any partys right to
seek monetary recovery from any Company Securityholder in the case of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by such Company Securityholder. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to limit any partys right to seek an injunction or specific performance with
respect to breaches of covenants and agreements of Parent, the Company or the
Securityholders Representative under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall any Merger
Consideration received by any Company Securityholder be subject to any
clawback pursuant to this Article VIII, except (a) for claims for indemnity
under Section 8.3(a)(i) for breaches of Fundamental Representations or
Securityholder Representations, (b) for claims for indemnity under Section
8.3(a)(ii)

 



-88-  through (vii) inclusive and (c) in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company.

 

8.5 _Distribution of Escrow Fund_. Upon the Escrow Termination Date, a portion
of the Escrow Fund (the " _Escrow Release Amount_ ") shall promptly be
delivered to (a) the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders (other than the Company Option Holders) and (b) the Company
for further distribution to the Company Option Holders, in each case, in
accordance with the Payment Schedule (as updated pursuant to Section 6.11).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time on or prior to the Escrow
Termination Date, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Securityholders
Representative and the Escrow Agent a Claim Certificate asserting a claim for
recovery under Section 8.3, then the Escrow Fund shall not terminate with
respect to the amount or reasonably anticipated amount of Losses set forth in
such Claim Certificate and which shall be subject to subsequent to resolution
of the claim in the manner provided in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Release Amount not required
to satisfy such claims to (i) the Exchange Agent for further distribution to
the Company Securityholders (other than the Company Option Holders) and (ii)
the Company for further distribution to the Company Option Holders, in each
case, in accordance with the Payment Schedule (as updated pursuant to Section

8.6 _Securityholders  Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite
consent of the Company Stockholders or by the execution of a letter of
transmittal by a Company Securityholder, each of the Company Securityholders
(other than such Company Stockholders, if any, who have perfected dissenters
or appraisal rights under Delaware or the applicable laws of the State
of California) shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Fortis Advisors LLC
as its agent and attorney-in-fact (the " _Securityholders  Representative_")
for and on behalf of the Company Securityholders to give and receive notices
and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the
Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to
such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises

Indemnified Party and any such Company Securityholder, in each case relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all
other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Securityholders Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing
or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this

 



-89-  Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Company
Securityholders holding a majority-in-interest of the Outstanding Shares (on
an as converted to Company Common Stock basis) immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders
Representative may resign at any time by providing written notice of intent to
resign to the Company Securityholders, which resignation shall be effective
upon the earlier of (A) thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such
written notice or (B) the appointment of a successor by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. The immunities and rights
to indemnification included in this Section 8.6(b) shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Securityholders Representative or any member of
the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. No bond shall be required of the Securityholders
Representative in connection with its services hereunder. The Securityholders
Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Payment Schedule, (ii)

applicable Company Securityholder or other party.

 

(b) Certain Company Securityholders have entered into a letter agreement with
the Securityholders Representative to provide direction to the
Securityholders Representative in connection with the performance of its
services under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Company
Securityholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the
Securityholders Representative (together with its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees) nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Securityholders  Representative
Group_") shall be liable to the Company Securityholders for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Securityholders Representative while acting in good
faith, even if such act or omission constitutes negligence on the part of
such Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative
shall only have the duties expressly stated in this Agreement and shall have
no other duty, express or implied. The Securityholders Representative may
engage attorneys, accountants and other professionals and experts. The
Securityholders Representative may in good faith rely conclusively upon
information, reports, statements and opinions prepared or presented by such
professionals, and any action taken by the Securityholders Representative
based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have been taken in good
faith. The Company Securityholders shall indemnify the Securityholders
Representative Group and defend and hold the Securityholders Representative
Group harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee, cost,
judgment, amount paid in settlement or expense incurred on the part of
the Securityholders Representative Group (so long as the Securityholders
Representative Group was acting in good faith in connection therewith) and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
the Securityholders Representative Groups duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses

 



-90-  of any legal counsel or other skilled professionals retained by the
Securityholders Representative and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers (" _Securityholders  Representative Expenses_"). The
Securityholders Representative shall have the right to retain
Securityholders Representative Expenses (i) first, from the Representative
Reimbursement Amount prior to any distribution to the Company Securityholders
(and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate setting forth the Securityholders Representative Expenses
actually incurred), (ii) second, from any distribution of the Escrow Fund or
Milestone Consideration otherwise distributable to the Company Securityholders
at the time of distribution, and (iii) third, directly from the Company
Securityholders based on their respective Pro Rata Portions. The
Company Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders Representative
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or administration of its duties. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders Representative, including
an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.4
or 9.5 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Company Securityholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Securityholders and
such Company Securityholders successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such Company Securityholders. The powers, immunities
and rights to indemnification granted by the Company Securityholders to the
Securityholders Representative and the Advisory Group under this Section 8.6:
(i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Company
Securityholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall
survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company Securityholder of the
whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.

case of Losses not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the amount
reasonably anticipated by the Indemnified Party to be incurred, paid reserved
or accrued); and (iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the
information then possessed by the Indemnified Party) the individual items of
such Losses included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to
which such Losses are related. If the Escrow Fund is available for
indemnification, at the time of delivery of any Claim Certificate to the
Securityholders Representative, a duplicate copy of such Claim Certificate
shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent and for a period of forty-five (45)
calendar days after such delivery to the Securityholders Representative of
such Claim

 



-91-  Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no payment pursuant to this Section
8.7 unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Securityholders Representative to make such delivery.

(b) If the Securityholders Representative does not contest, by written notice
to the Indemnified Party and, if the Escrow Fund is available for
indemnification, the Escrow Agent, any claim or claims by the Indemnified
Person made in any Claim Certificate within the forty-five (45) calendar day
period provided in Section 8.7 then (i) if the Escrow Fund is available for
indemnification, the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund
in an amount equal to the amount of any Losses corresponding to such claim or
claims as set forth in such Claim Certificate and (ii) if the Escrow Fund is
not available for indemnification, then, subject to Section 8.4, Parent may
setoff such Losses against any payment of Milestone Consideration pursuant to
Section 8.11. 

(c) If the Securityholders Representative objects in writing to any claim or
claims by the Indemnified Party made in any Claim Certificate within such
forty-five (45) calendar day period, the Indemnified Party and the
Securityholders Representative shall attempt in good faith for forty-five
(45) calendar days after the Indemnified Partys receipt of such written
objection to resolve such objection. If the Indemnified Party and the
Securityholders Representative shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, if the Escrow
Fund is available for indemnification, delivered to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such memorandum and
the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms of such memorandum.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-calendar day period for
good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such
45-calendar day period, either the Indemnified Party or the Securityholders
Representative may seek to resolve the matter through litigation brought in
accordance with Section 10.8.

 

8.8 _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party
claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes may result in indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, Parent
shall promptly notify the Securityholders Representative of such claim;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , no delay or failure on the part of an Indemnified
Party in delivering a notice of a Third Party Claim shall relieve the Company
Securityholders from any indemnification liability hereunder except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Third Party
Claim. If the contents and delivery of a notice of a Third Party Claim Notice
satisfy the content and delivery requirements of a Claim Certificate pursuant
to Section 8.7, then such notice shall also be deemed to be a Claim
Certificate. The Indemnified Party shall, at its election,

 



-92-  undertake and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of
its own choosing (and reasonably acceptable to the Securityholders
Representative); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Securityholders
Representative will be entitled to employ separate counsel and participate, at
its expense (on behalf of the Company Securityholders), but not control, the
defense of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _further_ , that except with
the prior written consent of the Securityholders Representative, no
settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants may be
effected by the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the
Securityholders Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably,
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any such
Third Party Claim without the Securityholders Representatives consent if
(x) the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money
damages by the Indemnified Party, (y) does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Company Securityholders, and (z) includes, as
an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the
Company Securityholders of a release (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Securityholders Representative) from all liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim.

(b)  If the Indemnified Party does not so elect to undertake and conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Securityholders Representative may
elect to undertake and conduct the defense of such claim with counsel of its
own choosing (and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party); provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party will be entitled to employ separate
counsel and participate, at its expense, but not control, the defense of such
Third Party Claim; provided, further, that except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, no settlement of any such Third Party Claim
with third party claimants may be effected by the Securityholders
Representative without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, such
consent not to be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders Representative shall have
the right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys consent if (x) the judgment or proposed settlement
involves only the payment of money damages by the Company Securityholders, (y)
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party, and (z) includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) from all liability
in respect of such Third Party Claim.

(c) Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall render to each
other such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other in order to
ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third Party Claim, including
furnishing records, information and testimony and attending
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals in
connection therewith.

 



-93- 8.9 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of the Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the Company and its businesses and operations. In connection with
Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company and its businesses and
operations, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representatives have
received from the Company or its representatives certain projections and other
forecasts for the Company and certain estimates, plans and budget
information. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (a) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; (b) Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with
such uncertainties; and (c) Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluations of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to
them or their representatives.

8.10 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
Article VIII will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for Tax
purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this Agreement,
unless otherwise required by law.

 

8.11 _Set-Off_. Subject to the limitations in this Article VIII, Parent shall
have the right to setoff (a) from up to one hundred percent (100%) of any
Revenue Consideration any Losses for (i) breaches of Fundamental
Representations or the Securityholder Representations, (ii) for claims for
indemnity under Section 8.3(ii) through (vii) inclusive, and (iii) in the
case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, and (b) from up
to twenty percent (20%) of any Revenue Consideration any Losses for any breach
of any representation or warranty of the Company or the Company
Securityholders contained in this Agreement (except for the Fundamental
Representations or the Securityholder Representations), in each case, claimed
by any Indemnified Party and deemed to be agreed to by the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to Section 8.7(b), actually agreed to in a memorandum
pursuant to Section 8.7(c) or determined to be owed by the Company
Securityholders pursuant to Section 8.7(d). In addition, Parent may holdback
from the Revenue Consideration any amount (consistent with the maximum amounts
set forth above in this Section 8.11), as in the reasonable judgment of
Parent, that may be necessary to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims
by an Indemnified Party for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate
delivered to the Securityholders Representative. Upon final resolution of
such claims pursuant to Section 8.7, Parent may setoff any amounts
(consistent with the maximum amounts set forth above in this Section 8.11)
owed to an Indemnified Party against the amount of Losses so finally
determined and shall remit the remaining portion (if any) of the applicable
payment of Revenue Consideration to (x) the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Company Securityholders (other than the Company Option
Holders) and (y) the Company for further

 



-94-  distribution to the Company Option Holders, in each case, in accordance with
the Payment Schedule (as updated pursuant to Section 6.11).

(e) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or

untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of
the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e)

(30) days following the receipt of written notice by the Company from Parent
of such breach (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) if Parent is in material breach of
this Agreement or if such breach by the Company is cured so that such
conditions would then be satisfied).

9.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 9.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of
a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other party hereto. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1,

shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall

obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.

stockholders of the Company, _provided_ that after approval and adoption

made which requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time either party
hereto, by action duly authorized by such party, may, to the extent legally
allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid

 



-96-  only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute
a waiver of such right.

 

ARTICLE X

retain a digital copy of the Data Archive and shall have full access to the
contents of such digital copy, solely for purposes of carrying out
Securityholders Representatives duties and obligations, and exercising
Securityholders Representatives rights, as the Securityholders
Representative under the terms of this Agreement, provided that the
Securityholders Representative shall not disclose the contents of the Data
Archive to any Person except to Permitted Recipients. " _Data Archive_ "
shall mean the documents posted on or before 11:59 pm on the date immediately

prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company shall remove or cause to be
removed from the Data Archive any and all documents or information that could

soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event more
than two (2) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company will deliver to Parent on one or more CD-ROM disks a complete and
accurate electronic copy of the Data Archive. The parties acknowledge and

or information included in the Data Archive.

 

10.2 _Continuing Counsel_. Parent hereby acknowledges that Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation (" _WSGR_ ") has acted as counsel
to the Company prior to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as

form of the transaction as a Merger may result in Parent inheriting the
attorney/client relationship and the rights pertaining thereto that currently
exist between the Company and WSGR. Parent agrees that (a) it will not seek to
disqualify WSGR from acting and continuing to act as counsel to the
Securityholders Representative in the event of a dispute hereunder or in the
course of the defense or prosecution of any claim relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) Parent agrees not to assert any
attorney-client privilege with respect to communications between WSGR and any
officer, securityholder, director or employee of the Company relating to the

-100- 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

10.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Escrow Agreement and the certificates delivered by the Company in
connection herewith (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and (b) are not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder and no Person is or shall be

respectively, (ii) the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to Section

10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

 

10.8 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that,
without posting bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be entitled
to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any proceeding instituted in any court of
the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties
and the matter in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the
case of 

 



-101-  any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal Court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware) (" _Federal Court_ "), this being in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party further agrees
that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such
breach or violation, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law
would be adequate.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. In any action or proceeding between any of
the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of any claim as to which the
federal courts have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal Court);
(ii) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding must be
commenced, and may be heard and determined, exclusively in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, the Federal Court);
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(and, if applicable, the Federal Court); and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware (or, if applicable, the Federal Court). Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.3. Nothing
in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

10.11 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.12  _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section
10.12 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



-102- 10.13 _No Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be
a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.
