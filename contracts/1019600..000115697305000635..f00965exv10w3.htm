(a)&nbsp;<U>Paying Agent</U>. Prior to the Effective Time, FME
shall select a bank or trust company that is reasonably approved
by Rome to act as paying agent (the &#147;<U>Paying
Agent</U>&#148;) for the payment of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of certificates representing Rome Common Stock.
FME shall provide to the Paying Agent immediately following the
Effective Time all the cash necessary to pay for the shares of

pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;).

(b)&nbsp;As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the
&#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Rome Common
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c),
(i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form as FME may specify
and Rome may reasonably approve) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for

for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such
Certificate the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Rome Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate have
been converted pursuant to the provisions of this
Article&nbsp;II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Rome Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Rome,
the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of FME that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

Rome Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Rome
Common Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of shares of Rome Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing
shares of Rome Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be

Article&nbsp;II before such demand shall thereafter look only to

or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered
prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately

respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become

applicable taxes that FME, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is legally required to deduct and withhold under

amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing

full corporate power and authority and possesses all
governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals (&#147;<U>Permits</U>&#148;) necessary to enable it to
own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the

Effect. Each of Rome and each Rome Subsidiary is duly qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to so qualify,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Rome Material Adverse Effect.
Rome has made available to the Florence Parties true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation of Rome, as

SECTION 3.11. <U>ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute
Payments</U>. (a)&nbsp;The Rome Disclosure Letter contains a
list of all Rome Benefit Plans that are &#147;employee pension
benefit plans&#148; (as defined in Section&nbsp;3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(&#147;<U>ERISA</U>&#148;)) (&#147;<U>Rome Pension
Plans</U>&#148;) or &#147;employee welfare benefit plans&#148;
(as defined in Section&nbsp;3(1) of ERISA) (&#147;<U>Rome
Welfare Plans</U>&#148;) and all other material Rome Benefit
Plans. Each Rome Benefit Plan has been administered in
compliance with its terms, other than instances of noncompliance
that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Rome Material Adverse
Effect. Rome has made available to the Florence Parties true,
complete and correct copies of (i)&nbsp;each Rome Benefit Plan
(or, in the case of any unwritten Rome Benefit Plan, a
description thereof), (ii)&nbsp;the most recent annual report on
Form&nbsp;5500 filed with the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to each Rome Benefit Plan (if any such report was
required), (iii)&nbsp;the most recent summary plan description
for each Rome Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required or was otherwise prepared and
(iv)&nbsp;each trust agreement, funding arrangement, and group
annuity contract, third party administration agreement and
investment management agreement relating to any Rome Benefit
Plan.

(b) All Rome Pension Plans that are intended to be tax qualified
have been the subject of determination letters from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Rome Pension Plans are
qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under
Sections&nbsp;401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and
no such determination letters have been revoked, and, to the
knowledge of Rome, no such revocation has been threatened. Each
such determination letter is current in that it covers all of
the provisions of each Rome Pension Plan to which it relates
(including changes required by applicable law) with respect to
which the Code Section 401(b) remedial amendment period has
expired as of the date of this Agreement, and with respect to
any such provisions with respect to which the Code Section
401(b) remedial amendment period has not expired as of the date
of this Agreement, a timely application for a determination has
been filed for such Rome Pension Plan, and is pending before the
Internal Revenue Service. To the knowledge of Rome, nothing has
occurred since the date of the determination letters that would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
qualification of the Rome Pension Plans. Each trust intended to
qualify under Section&nbsp;501(c)(9) of the Code so qualifies in
form and in operation in all material respects, meets the
requirements of Section&nbsp;505(c) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder in all material respects, and has
received an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
that such trust so qualifies, and no fact or event has occurred
since the date of any opinion letter which could affect
adversely the exempt status of any such trust, except as has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Rome Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) Rome and its ERISA Affiliates and all the Rome Benefit Plans

Rome Benefit Plans have been timely filed with applicable
government agencies and/or distributed to participants, except
where the failure to be so filed or distributed, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Rome Material Adverse Effect. There is not

Section&nbsp;514(b)(6) or a welfare benefit fund within the
meaning of Code Section&nbsp;419(e), and (B)&nbsp;none of Rome,
any ERISA Affiliate nor any Rome Welfare Plan has ever provided
or has any obligation to provide in the future to current or
former employees any material medical, life insurance or other
welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of
service, other than coverage mandated by applicable Law.

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Rome
Material Adverse Effect, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will (a)&nbsp;result in any payment
(including severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, or otherwise) becoming due to any director, employee
or independent contractor of Rome or any ERISA Affiliate,
(b)&nbsp;increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Rome
Benefit Plan, or (c)&nbsp;result in any acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any benefit under any Rome Benefit
Plan. Neither Rome nor any ERISA Affiliate, nor any of their
officers or directors, has taken any direct or indirect action
which obligates Rome or any ERISA Affiliate to institute, modify
or change, any Rome Benefit Plan, or the manner in which
contributions to any Rome Benefit Plan are made or the basis on
which such contributions are determined, except for such
institutions, modifications or changes that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have a Rome Material Adverse Effect. The deduction of any
amount payable pursuant to the terms of the Rome Benefit Plans
would not be subject to disallowance under Code
Section&nbsp;162(m) (before giving effect to Code Section
162(m)(4)(F)) for any taxable years of Rome ending prior to the

pay its probable liability on existing debts as they mature),
(ii)&nbsp;have unreasonably small capital with which to engage

its ability to pay as they become due. For purposes hereof, Rome

SECTION 5.02. <U>No Solicitation</U>. (a)&nbsp;Rome hereby
represents and warrants to the Florence Parties that as of the
date hereof there are no existing discussions or negotiations
between Rome and any third party or parties, other than the
Florence Parties, relating to any Takeover Proposal (as defined
in Section&nbsp;5.02(e)). Rome shall not, and it shall not
authorize or permit any Rome Subsidiary to, and it shall not
authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative
(collectively, &#147;<U>Representatives</U>&#148;) of, Rome or
any Rome Subsidiary to (i)&nbsp;solicit, initiate or encourage
the submission of any Takeover Proposal, (ii)&nbsp;enter into
any agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or
(iii)&nbsp;participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal; <U>provided,</U>
<U>however</U>, that Rome and its Representatives may, in
response to a Takeover Proposal that the Rome Board determines,
in good faith, could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section&nbsp;5.02(e)) that was
not solicited by Rome and that did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.02(a), and subject to compliance with
Section&nbsp;5.02(c), (x)&nbsp;furnish information with respect
to Rome to the person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not contain
any &#147;standstill&#148; or similar covenant) and
(y)&nbsp;participate in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of a revised Takeover Proposal) with such person
and its Representatives regarding any Takeover Proposal. In the
event that Rome enters into a confidentiality agreement with a
person making a Takeover Proposal that does not include a
&#147;standstill&#148; provision or contains a
&#147;standstill&#148; provision substantially less favorable to
Rome than the corresponding provision of the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in Section&nbsp;6.02), the applicable
Florence Parties and their affiliates shall, without further
action by Rome, be released from the &#147;standstill&#148;
provision under Section&nbsp;6 of the Confidentiality Agreement
to the extent necessary to render such &#147;standstill&#148;
provision of the Confidentiality Agreement no more favorable to
Rome than the &#147;standstill&#148;, if any, applicable to the
person making such Takeover Proposal.

(i)(A) above, if the Rome Board (or such committee thereof)

counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with
applicable law, including its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Rome (including, but not limited to, the Rome
Board&#146;s duties of good faith and candor to the stockholders
of Rome); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made until the expiration of a

Adverse Recommendation</U>&#148;) from Rome advising the
Florence Parties that the Rome Board intends to take such action

proposed action by the Rome Board (it being understood and

Change, any material change in the principal rationale stated by
the Rome Board for such previous Adverse Recommendation Change,

Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new three business day

Recommendation Change, the Rome Board shall take into account
any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
the Florence Parties in response to a Rome Notice of Adverse
Recommendation or otherwise.

the Florence Parties and the Representatives of the Florence
Parties, reasonable access during normal business hours during

properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and

Rome Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Florence Parties,
(a)&nbsp;a copy of each report, schedule, form, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal, state or foreign

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Rome may withhold (i)&nbsp;any
document or information that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party or (ii)&nbsp;such
portions of documents or information relating to pricing or
other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such
documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by
Rome&#146;s counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust
difficulties for such party (or any of its affiliates). If any
material is withheld by Rome pursuant to the proviso to the
preceding sentence, Rome shall inform the Florence Parties as to
the general nature of what is being withheld. All information
exchanged pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.02 shall be subject to

6.03(c) below, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,
in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including (i)&nbsp;the taking of all acts
necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in
Article&nbsp;VII to be satisfied, (ii)&nbsp;the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals
from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid
an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
(iii)&nbsp;the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iv)&nbsp;the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v)&nbsp;the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Merger and the Transactions and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, (i)&nbsp;Rome and the Rome Board
shall (A)&nbsp;take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any Transaction or this Agreement,

Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute

informed about the status of the Financing, including providing

(b)&nbsp;In furtherance and not in limitation of the other
provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.03, each of the Florence
Parties and Rome agrees to make, and the Florence Parties agree
to cause Florence Parent to make, an appropriate filing of a
notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act (and to
make such other filings as are required under laws in foreign
jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger control matters
(together with the HSR Act, &#147;<U>Antitrust Laws</U>&#148;))
with respect to the Merger and the Transactions as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement but in any event
not later than fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days after the date of
this Agreement, and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to Antitrust Laws. Each of the Florence
Parties and Rome will use its best efforts to cause, and the
Florence Parties shall cause Florence Parent to use its best
efforts to cause, the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of
required approvals under Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable.
The parties hereto agree not to extend, and the Florence Parties
shall cause Florence Parent not to extend, directly or
indirectly any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into
any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to
consummate the Merger and the Transactions, except with the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Each of the
Florence Parties and Rome will, and the Florence Parties will
cause Florence Parent to, (x)&nbsp;promptly notify the other
party of any written communication to that party from any
Governmental Entity located in the United States and, to the
extent practicable, outside of the United States and, subject to
applicable Law, if practicable, permit the other party to review
in advance any proposed written communication to any such
Governmental Entity and incorporate the other party&#146;s
reasonable comments, (y)&nbsp;not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend, and (z)&nbsp;furnish the other
party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written
communications between them and their affiliates and their
respective Representatives on one hand, and any such
Governmental Entity or its staff on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions. If any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity that
would make the Merger or the other Transactions illegal or would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, each of
the Florence Parties shall, and shall cause Florence Parent to,
use its best efforts, including selling, holding separate or
otherwise disposing of or conducting its business in a specified
manner, or agreeing to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose
of or conduct its business in a specified manner or permitting
the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets
of the Florence Parties, Florence Parent, or their respective
subsidiaries, or after the Closing, Rome or the Rome
Subsidiaries, or the conducting of its business in a specified
manner, to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and
shall, and shall cause Florence Parent to, use its best efforts
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other
Transactions and to have such statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the Transactions. Rome will cooperate with the
Florence Parties in all respects in the Florence Parties&#146;
or Florence Parent&#146;s implementation of any of the measures
described in the preceding sentence that is undertaken in order
to permit consummation of the Merger or the Transactions
(including entering into agreements or taking such other actions
prior to the Closing as the Florence Parties reasonably request
to dispose of assets of Rome and the Rome Subsidiaries;

neither Rome nor any Rome Subsidiary shall be required pursuant

assets of Rome or a Rome Subsidiary prior to the Closing or

(c)&nbsp;In furtherance and not in limitation of the other
provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.03, the Florence Parties shall
use their best efforts to (i)&nbsp;enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, and to obtain funding under, the
Financing provided for in the Commitment Letter and
(ii)&nbsp;subject to Rome&#146;s obligations under the last
sentence of this Section&nbsp;6.03(c), take any and all actions
necessary to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in such
definitive agreements. In the event that any portion of such
Financing becomes unavailable, in the manner or from the sources
originally contemplated, the Florence Parties shall use their
best efforts to obtain any such portion on substantially
comparable terms to the Financing provided for in the Commitment
Letter from alternative sources. In the event that any portion
of the Financing becomes unavailable on terms substantially
comparable to the Financing provided for in the Commitment
Letter, despite the Florence Parties use of their best efforts
pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Florence Parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any such
portion on such other terms as are available from alternative
sources. Rome shall use its best efforts (provided that the
effectiveness of any actions taken pursuant to this sentence
shall be expressly conditioned on consummation of the Merger) to
(i)&nbsp;take actions reasonably requested in writing by the
Florence Parties that are necessary to facilitate the Financing,
including actions with respect to Rome&#146;s Credit Agreement,
dated as of February&nbsp;10, 2004, among the parties named
therein and (ii)&nbsp;to satisfy the conditions precedent in the
Commitment Letter to the extent such conditions relate to Rome
or are within the control of Rome; provided that in connection
with any effort by the Florence Parties to obtain financing from
alternative sources as contemplated by the immediately preceding
sentence, Rome shall be required, consistent with the Florence
Parties obligations, to use its reasonable best efforts.
