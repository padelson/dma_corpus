hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 _The_ _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in accordance with Section 259
of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation by virtue of the Merger
and without further act or deed by the parties.

Section 1.02  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd
Street, New York, New York 10019, or at another place agreed to in writing by
the parties, at 9:00 a.m. New York time on the second (2nd) Business Day
following the date on which each of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VI_ is satisfied, or to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by
the party entitled to waive such condition (except in any such case for any
such conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only on the Closing
Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the party entitled to waive such
conditions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_, then the Closing will occur on the earlier of
(i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent to the
Company on no less than two (2) Business Days prior written notice to the
Company and (ii) the third (3rd) Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period (subject, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ at such time (except in any
such case for any such conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only
on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or,
or to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the party entitled to
waive such conditions). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, Parent and the
Company shall file a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with,
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on
the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time
as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.04 _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of
the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time (i) the Company Charter,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ , and as so
amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the Company By-laws shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated, shall
be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that references to the
name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving
Corporation), in each case until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Directors_. The board of directors of the Surviving Corporation effective
as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time shall consist of the

(c)  _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share (each, a " _Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded
Shares, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive $23.50 in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and all of such
Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall cease to exist, and each
certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated
Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that formerly
represented any of the Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(ii)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall
thereafter be cancelled and cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_.

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent or
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 



3 (iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. If, from the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
2.01(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other
provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., or another U.S.-based nationally recognized financial
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which such
holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in
cash equal to the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the holders of Shares that
are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. In the event the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount in cash sufficient to make such payments. Funds made
available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, if and
as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.02_; _provided_ , that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making
the payments required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, and following any losses
from any such investment, Parent shall promptly deposit with the Paying Agent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, an amount in cash equal to the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall
direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
former holders of Shares and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.02_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



4 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificated Shares_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_ to the Paying Agent) and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificate in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon
delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificate, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that was not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, _provided_ that it
shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)
the person requesting such payment shall have paid any and all transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
so surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_. In lieu thereof, each
registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon
the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) or in respect of
any Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be deemed to have been 

 



5  paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable
Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_, without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Share for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official in
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate
Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options, Stock Units, Restricted Stock and
Equity Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan
(the " _Company Options_ ") shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled
Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company
Option, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option
Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) any such 

 



6  Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per Share subject
thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (y) such Option Payments may
be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option
shall be exercisable, and each Company Option shall only entitle the holder
thereof to the payment provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_.

(b) _Treatment of Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding award of restricted stock units or deferred stock units (other
than notional Shares credited under the Deferred Compensation Plan) (" _Stock
Units_ ") with respect to Shares (each, a " _Stock Unit Award_ ") granted
pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall be converted into a right to receive a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the sum of (i) the product of (A) the
Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Stock Units subject to
such Stock Unit Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the
" _Stock Unit Payments_ ") and (ii) the dividend equivalents accrued on such
Stock Unit Award prior to the Closing Date, which shall be funded, and become
vested and payable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable award agreement relating to such Stock Unit Award. In the case of a
Stock Unit Award that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the
number of Shares subject to such Stock Unit Award that are earned based on
performance shall be determined as of the Closing Date in accordance with the
terms of the applicable award agreement, as such agreement may be amended as
permitted under _Section_ __ _ 5.01_.

 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and without any action on the part of
Parent, Sub, the Company or any holder of an outstanding award of restricted
stock (" _Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (a "
_Restricted Stock Award_ "), as of the Effective Time each holder of
Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of
(i) the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Sections 2.01_ and _2.02_
multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) and
(ii) the dividend equivalents accrued on such Restricted Stock Award prior to
the Closing Date, which Merger Consideration shall be funded, and become
vested and payable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable award agreement relating to such Restricted Stock Award. In the
case of a Restricted Stock Award that is subject to performance-based vesting
conditions, the number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award that
are deemed to have been earned shall be equal to the maximum number of shares
subject to such award, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award
agreement.

 

(d) _Treatment of Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall, prior to the
Closing Date, take all actions necessary to terminate the Company Stock
Purchase Plan and all outstanding rights thereunder as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ that from and after the date hereof, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) ensure that the current
offering period shall end on June 30, 2017 and the Company Stock Purchase
Plan shall thereafter be suspended, such that no new offering period shall
commence after the date hereof, (ii) ensure that no new participants be
permitted to participate in the Company Stock Purchase Plan and that the
existing participants thereunder may not increase their elections with respect
to the offering period in effect on the date hereof (the " _Final Payment
Period_ ") and (iii) provide notice to participants describing the treatment
of the Company Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(d)_.

 



7 (e) _Deferred Compensation Plan_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent,
Sub, the Company or any participant in the Companys Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan (the " _Deferred Compensation Plan_ "), any participant
accounts (or portions thereof) which are notionally invested in Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Notional Shares_ ") shall be
notionally reinvested in one or more other "Measurement Funds" (as defined in
Deferred Compensation Plan) as determined by the Company prior to the
Effective Time until such accounts are distributed to the participants in the
Deferred Compensation Plan.

 

(f) _Termination of Share Rights under Company Stock Plans_. As of the
Effective Time, no further Company Options, Stock Units, Restricted Stock,
Notional Shares or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.

(g) _Parent Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Surviving Corporation cash in the amount necessary to make the payments
required under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_, (b) and (c), as applicable, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments required
under this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ through the Companys payroll agent as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), or at such later time as
provided under the terms of the Stock Unit Awards referenced in _Section_ __ _
2.03(b)_ or the terms of the Restricted Stock Awards referenced in _Section_
__ _ 2.03(c)_, as applicable, subject in all cases to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_
and the applicable terms of the Company Stock Plans.

 

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL
concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of such Shares
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall, at the Effective Time, not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , but shall rather become cancelled and cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such
Dissenting Stockholder withdraws such Dissenting Stockholders demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting Stockholders
right of appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any case pursuant to the
DGCL, such Shares shall be deemed not to be Dissenting Shares and shall be
deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest and subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.05_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and the opportunity to participate in negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal in respect of Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

 



8 Section 2.05 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are deducted and withheld in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ by or
on behalf of Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, such deducted and withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by
Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to
the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.06 _Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Sub, the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

sections of any such filings and any disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer contained in any such filings, or (b)
as disclosed in the corresponding section of the separate disclosure letter
that has been delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement, including the documents attached to or incorporated by
reference in such disclosure letter (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to
any other section or subsection in this Agreement to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Sub as follows:

 

Section 3.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal
entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization (in
the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such
concept) except, with respect to the Company Subsidiaries, where such
failure, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to be materially adverse to the Company. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has requisite corporate or other legal entity, as the case may be,
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



9 (b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (i)
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as
amended (the " _Company Charter_ "), and (ii) the Third Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company By_ _-laws_ "), in each case as
amended through the date hereof. Each of the Company Charter and the Company
By-laws is in full force and effect, and the Company is in material
compliance with the provisions thereof.

(c) Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth for each
Company Subsidiary (i) its name and jurisdiction of organization, (ii) its
form of organization and (iii) the holders of its equity ownership interests.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, directly or indirectly,
owns any equity interest in any person other than the Company Subsidiaries.
The Company has delivered or made available to Parent accurate and complete in
all material respects copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
other charter and organizational documents of each of the Company
Subsidiaries, including all amendments thereto, as in effect on the date

and 25,000,000 shares of the Companys preferred stock, par value $0.001 per

2017 (the " _Specified Date_ "), (i) 85,154,906 Shares were issued and

which were duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and
free of preemptive rights, (ii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding, and (iii) 3,091,811 Shares were held in treasury. No

commitments of any character obligating the Company to issue any Shares
or other equity interest (or to pay any amount based on the value of Shares
or such other equity interest) in the Company to such Company Subsidiary.

 

(b) As of the close of business on the Specified Date, the Company had no
Shares or Company Preferred Stock reserved for issuance, except

Shares for outstanding Stock Units, 1,530,610 Shares for outstanding Notional
Shares, and 880,197 Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company
Stock Purchase Plan) (calculated, with respect to outstanding Stock Unit
Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, assuming that
the performance goals have been satisfied at 100% of the target level of
performance). All Shares subject to issuance under the Company Stock Plans,
upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and free of
preemptive rights. All Company Options were granted with a per share exercise
price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying Shares on the
date of grant, as determined under Section 409A of the Code.

 



10 (c) As of the date of this Agreement, except for the Company Options, Stock
Units and Notional Shares, there are no outstanding or existing (i) options,
warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, convertible securities,
agreements or commitments of any kind to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries is a party, or by which it is bound, obligating the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any
shares of capital stock or other equity interest in the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
shares or equity interests relating to or based on the value of the equity
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) obligations of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any capital stock or equity securities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or (iii) voting trusts or similar agreements or other
Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or by
which it is bound, with respect to the voting or registration of securities
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Shares constitute the only
outstanding class of securities of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
registered under, or required to be registered under, the Securities Act.

(d) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary having the right to vote (or

any matter on which stockholders of the Company or any Company Subsidiary may
vote.

 

(e) The Company or another Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly,
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens
(other than transfer and other restrictions under applicable federal and state
securities Laws or applicable foreign Laws), and all of such outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity securities have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

 

Section 3.03 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform this Agreement and consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company Board and, other

or indirectly: (i) subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or Company By-

any Company Subsidiary is a party (or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound) or any Company Permit, except,
with respect to _clauses_ __ _ (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_ or for (A) any such consents and approvals the failure

authorization or permit of, or filing or registration with or notification to,
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or any of their respective properties or assets, other than (i) the filing of

waivers, consents, approvals, waiting periods or agreements required

 



12  under the HSR Act or any other applicable U.S. or foreign competition,
antitrust, merger control or investment Laws (together with the HSR Act, "
_Antitrust Laws_ "), (iii) compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, (iv) filings as may be required under the

and are set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (collectively, the " _FCC Approvals_ "); (vii) such consents,
approvals, authorizations, permits, actions, waivers, no action statements,

(viii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits of, or to make such filings, registrations with or notifications to,
any Governmental Entity, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.05 _Permits; Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, variances,
exemptions, approvals, orders, registrations and clearances of any
Governmental Entity (each, a " _Permit_ ") necessary for the Company and each
Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, and to
carry on and operate its businesses as currently conducted (the " _Company
Permits_ "), and all such Company Permits are in full force and effect, and
are not subject to any conditions except for those conditions appearing on the
face of the Company Permits and conditions applicable to holders of
substantially similar Permits generally, except where the failure to possess,
or the failure to be in full force and effect of, or the imposition of such
conditions on, any Company Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
Companys knowledge and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) there
exist no facts or circumstances that make it likely that any Company Permit
will not be renewed or extended in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice on commercially reasonable terms, (ii) no
Governmental Entity has commenced, or given written notice to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that it intends to commence, a proceeding to revoke, or
suspend, rescind, modify or not renew, or to impose any materially adverse
condition on, any Company Permit, (iii) all reports and filings required to
be filed with the relevant Governmental Entity by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with respect to any Company Permit have been timely filed and are
accurate and complete, (iv) all regulatory fees, contributions or surcharges
required to be paid by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect
to any Company permit have been timely paid, and (v) the Company and each
Company Subsidiary are, and since January 1, 2015 have been, in compliance
with the terms of all Company Permits. The Company has no applications pending
before the FCC or a State PSC relating to Company Permits or seeking the
issuance of additional Company Permits. The Company is qualified under Law to
transfer control of the Company Permits to Parent, and to the knowledge of
Company, there is no fact or circumstance relating to the Company Permits or
the Company or its Subsidiaries that would cause the FCC to deny the grant of
the FCC Approvals or a State PSC to deny grant of a State PSC Approval.

 



13 (b) Since January 1, 2015 (and with respect to Antitrust Laws, since May 1,
2012), the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have been in
compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective businesses and activities, except for such non-
compliance that, individually or in the aggregate, have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no
outstanding notice of material liability, material forfeiture order or any
other material sanction against the Company or any Company Subsidiary issued
by the FCC or any State PSC. To the knowledge of the Company, no investigation
by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is pending, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in writing an intention to conduct any
such investigation, except for such investigations the outcomes of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) This _Section_ __ _ 3.05_ does not relate to the Company SEC Documents
or financial statements, which are the subject of _Section_ __ _ 3.06_;
employee benefit matters, which are the subject of _Section_ __ _ 3.12_; Tax

Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the NASDAQ.

 



14 (b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company (including, in each case, any

the case of interim financial statements, for normal year-end adjustments that
were not or will not be material in amount or effect).

(c) As of the date hereof, other than as set forth in the Company Financial
Statements, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party

arrangements" that would be required to be disclosed under Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, at any time the Proxy Statement is
amended or supplemented, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material

thereunder and other applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information
supplied by Parent or Sub or any of their representatives specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial

Except as disclosed in the corresponding section of the separate disclosure
letter that has been delivered by Parent and Sub to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement, including the documents attached to or
incorporated by reference in such disclosure letter (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section
or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall also be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection in this Agreement to
which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), Parent and Sub
hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company:

Section 4.01 _Organization_. Each of Parent and Sub is a corporation or other
legal entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each of Parent and Sub has requisite corporate or other legal
entity, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any such failure to be so organized, existing, in good
standing or to have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 4.02 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Sub has the requisite corporate
or other legal entity power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Sub and the consummation by them
of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or
other legal entity action on the part of Parent and Sub, and no other
corporate or other legal entity proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Parent
and Sub of this Agreement or the consummation

 



28  by Parent or Sub of the Transactions other than the adoption of this
Agreement by the sole stockholder of Sub (which adoption shall occur promptly
following the execution of this Agreement). This Agreement has been, and any
other agreements or instruments to be delivered pursuant hereto by Parent or
Sub will be, duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and (assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
parties thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and when executed and delivered
such other agreements and instruments will constitute, the valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Sub enforceable against each of them in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

Section 4.03 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent
and Sub or the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Transactions will (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both), directly or indirectly: (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation,
by-laws or any equivalent organizational or governing documents of Parent or
Sub; (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations described
in _Section_ __ _ 4.03(b)_ have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in _Section_ __ _ 4.03(b)_ have been made and any
waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict with or
violate any Law applicable to Parent or Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets; or (iii) require any consent or approval under,
violate, conflict with, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit
under, or constitute a default under, or result in termination or give to
others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted
Lien) upon any of the respective properties or assets of Parent or Sub
pursuant to, any Contract to which Parent or Sub is a party (or by which any
of their respective properties or assets are bound) or any Permit held by it
or them, except, with respect to _clauses_ __ _ (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for (A)
any such consents and approvals, the failure to obtain which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions and (B) any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, losses, defaults, terminations, rights of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation or Liens that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(b) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by or on
behalf of Parent or Sub or the consummation by Parent or Sub or any of their
respective affiliates of the Transactions will require (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing or registration with or notification to, any Governmental
Entity, other than (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (ii) the filing of a premerger
notification and report form under the HSR Act and the receipt, termination or
expiration, as applicable, of waivers, consents, approvals, waiting periods
or agreements required under any Antitrust Laws, (iii) compliance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; (iv)
compliance with any applicable international, federal or state securities
"blue sky" Laws; (v) the FCC Approvals; (vi) the State PSC Approvals; and
(vii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits of, or to make such filings, registrations with or notifications to,
any Governmental Entity would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



29 Section 4.04 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub or any of their respective
affiliates expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, at any
time the Proxy Statement is amended or supplemented, at the time the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

 

Section 4.05 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Proceeding to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, none
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order,
writ, injunction, judgment or decree that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the Transactions.

Section 4.06 _Capitalization and Operations of Sub; No Ownership of Company
Common Stock_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized equity capital of Sub
consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, 100 of
which shares are validly issued and outstanding, and 100 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.001 per share, none of which are outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding equity capital of Sub is, and at the Effective Time
will be, owned directly or indirectly by Parent. Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and it has not conducted any business
prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective
Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other
than those incidental to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement or the
Financing.

 

(b) None of Parent, Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries beneficially
owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares, other than
pursuant to this Agreement. None of Parent, Sub, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or the "affiliates" or "Associates" of any such entity is, and at
no time during the last three (3) years has been, an "Interested Stockholder"
of the Company, in each case as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Section 4.07  _Financing_.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true
and complete copies of (i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), among Parent, Sub and the
other parties thereto (the " _Equity Financing Sources_ "), pursuant to which
the Equity Financing Sources have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the amounts
set forth therein on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and to which the Company is an express third party
beneficiary (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (ii) the executed commitment

 



30  letter (together with the term sheet and any other annexes, exhibits,
schedules and other attachments thereto), dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the " _Financing Commitments_ ") among Parent, Sub and the financial
institutions party thereto (the " _Lenders_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing Sources, the " _Financing Sources_ "), pursuant to which the
Lenders have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend
the amounts set forth therein for purposes of funding a portion of the
Transactions on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.02_ (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity
Financing, the " _Financing_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
also delivered to the Company true and complete copies of any and all fee
letter(s) (with only the fee amounts, "flex" terms and other economic terms
redacted, none of which redacted terms, individually or in the aggregate,
would reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to
satisfy the Financing Uses on the Closing Date (after taking into account the
amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) or adversely affect the conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing or materially delay or prevent the Closing
or make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur) relating to
the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee letter, a " _Fee Letter_ ").

(b) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, the aggregate net proceeds from the Financing when funded in
accordance with the Financing Commitments, together with available cash of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, are sufficient to fund all of the
amounts required to be provided by Parent or Sub under this Agreement for the
consummation of the Transactions and are sufficient for the satisfaction when
due of all of the obligations of Parent and Sub under this Agreement,
including the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, the amounts
payable by Parent or Sub pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and the payment of
all costs and expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Parent or Sub in
connection with the Transactions and any repayment or refinancing of
Indebtedness required in connection therewith or contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ ").

(c) As of the date hereof, all of the Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect and, except as permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 5.07_, no such amendment, supplement or modification is
contemplated by Parent or Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, by the other
parties thereto. As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form delivered to the Company, is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent, Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against Parent, Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, such other
parties thereto in accordance with its terms and conditions, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There are no side letters or other Contracts
or arrangements to which Parent, Sub, the Guarantors or their affiliates is a
party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount
of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments and other than the Fee Letters and customary engagement letters
and customary fee credit letters, none of which Fee Letters or engagement
letters (i) reduce the amount of the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitments below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses on the
Closing Date (after taking into account the amount of the available cash of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), (ii) impose any new or additional
conditions precedent or otherwise adversely

 



31  amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent to the Financing
Commitments, (iii) would materially delay or prevent the Closing, (iv) make
the funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing less likely to
occur or (v) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. As of the date
hereof, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent or Sub under any term, or a failure of any condition, of
the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses contemplated thereby being unavailable
on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.02_. As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, neither Parent nor
Sub has reason to believe that it or any Equity Financing Source would be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing
Commitments required to be satisfied by it. As of the date hereof, Parent and
Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.

(d) None of Parent, Sub, the Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates
(which for purposes of this Section 4.07(d) shall be deemed to include each
direct investor in Parent) has entered into any Contract prohibiting or
seeking to prohibit any bank or other potential provider of debt financing
from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to any person other than
Parent or Sub in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any Competing
Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

Section 4.08 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Sub have caused the Guarantors to deliver the Guarantee, dated as
of the date hereof, to the Company. The Guarantee is in full force and effect
and has not been withdrawn or terminated (other than termination in accordance
with the express terms of the Guarantee) or otherwise amended, supplemented
or modified (other than amendments, supplements or modifications made with the
express written consent of Parent) in any respect. The Guarantee is a legal
and valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors, enforceable against the
Guarantors in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception (other than as a result of a termination of the Guarantee in
accordance with the express terms of the Guarantee or as a result of
amendments, supplements or modifications of the Guarantee made with the
express written consent of Parent). No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of the Guarantors under such Guarantee.

Section 4.09 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker other
than LionTree Advisors, LLC is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based on arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates.

 



32 Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation
of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, (b)
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_
are accurate in all material respects and (c) the most recent financial
statements included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material
respects the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby
and the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its consolidated
Company Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby in accordance with GAAP,
then immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions
(including the funding of the Financing being entered into in connection
therewith and the Financing Uses), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent. Parent and Sub are not
entering into the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of Parent, Sub, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any affiliates thereof.

Section 4.11 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. Other than this Agreement and
the Voting Agreements, as of the date hereof, there are no Contracts or any
commitments to enter into any Contract between Parent, Sub or any of their
respective controlled affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer,
employee or stockholder of the Company, on the other hand, relating to the
Transactions or the operations of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any
Contract or any commitments to enter into any Contract pursuant to which: (i)
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or (ii) other than
the Voting Agreements, any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt
this Agreement or approve the Merger or agrees to vote against any Competing
Proposal.

 

Section 4.12 _Entity Structure_. _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each person who, as of the date
hereof, (a) holds a direct or indirect interest (including aggregated
interests) in Parent that is required to be disclosed pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §
63.04 and 63.24 or (b) exercises control over Parent as defined in 47 C.F.R.
§ 63.09(b) (each person covered by (a) or (b), a " _Reportable Person_ "),
including (i) the jurisdiction of organization of such person (if such person
is not an individual) or the citizenship of such person (if such person is an
individual) and (ii) the equity or voting interests of Parent or such other
Reportable Person that are held by such person if such direct or indirect
interest is 10% or greater. As of the date hereof, all Reportable Persons who
are individuals are solely U.S. citizens (i.e., not holding any form of
non-U.S. and/or dual citizenship) and all Reportable Persons that are entities
are organized in United States. None of Parent nor any of its affiliates
(within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 153(1)) (A) is a telecommunications
provider pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 63.03(b)(ii); (B) is an affiliate of a
foreign carrier pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 63.12(c)(1); or (C) is an affiliate
of a dominant U.S. carrier pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 63.12(c)(2). As of the date
hereof, to the knowledge of Parent and pursuant to 47 C.F. R. s
63.03(c)(i)-(iv), (x) the applications to be filed by the parties for the FCC
Approvals are not expected by Parent to include a non-routine request for
waiver of the Commissions rule or, on their face, violate a Commission rule
or the Communications Act; and (y) Parent expects to respond promptly to
Commission inquiries assuming timely cooperation by the Company to the extent
required. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no fact or circumstance
relating to the entity structure or ownership that would cause the FCC to
deny the grant of the FCC Approvals or a State PSC to deny the grant of a
State PSC Approval.

 



33 Section 4.13 _Acknowledgment_ _of No Other Representations or Warranties_.
Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent
investigation and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) and prospects of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges
and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties contained in

Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or the
Company Representatives make or have made any other representation or
warranty, either express or implied, concerning the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or
prospects or the Transactions. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, except with respect to the representations and warranties contained in

breach of any covenant or other agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in any of the Transaction Documents and except in the case of
fraud or willful breach, none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their respective affiliates or the Company Representatives shall have any
liability to Parent or Sub or their respective affiliates or representatives
on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state
securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any other representation or warranty,
either express or implied, included in any information or statements (or any
omissions therefrom) provided or made available by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates or the Company Representatives to
Parent, Sub or their respective affiliates or representatives in connection
with the Transactions.

38  and its representatives regarding such Competing Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company (x) will not, will not permit the Company

disclose any material non-public information regarding the Company to such
person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement

sentence of this _Section 5.03(b)_.

(c) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ or _Section_ __ _

Recommendation or fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy

statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a

communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act, (iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Competing Proposal, or fail
to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case within
ten (10) days after the written request of Parent following a Competing

Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement relating to, or that is intended to result in, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may make a Change of Company Recommendation, solely in response to (1) a
Superior Proposal or (2) an Intervening Event, if:

 



39 (i) either (A) a Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach (other
than a breach that is _de minimis_ ) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ is made to
the Company by a third person and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn or
(B) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing;

 

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) in the case of a
Competing Proposal, such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (y) the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(iii) the Company provides Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice of the Companys intention to make a Change of Company
Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice
shall (x) state expressly that it has received a Superior Proposal or that an
Intervening Event has occurred, (y) in the case of a Superior Proposal,
identify the person making such Superior Proposal and include the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and the Company shall
contemporaneously provide a copy of any relevant Acquisition Agreement and any
other relevant transaction documents to Parent), or, in the case of an
Intervening Event, the material facts and circumstances of such Intervening
Event and (z) state expressly that the Company Board intends to make a Change
of Company Recommendation, and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor;

(iv) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated in good faith with
Parent with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent for at least three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of
such Notice of Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two (2) Business Day
period from the date of such notice);

 

(v) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by
Parent in writing, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x)
in the case of a Competing Proposal, such Competing Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were to be given effect and (y) the failure to make a Change of
Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

 

(vi) the Company shall have complied with this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event (other than with
respect to any breach that is _de minimis_ ).

(e) Notwithstanding any Change of Company Recommendation, unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VII_,
(x) this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation and (y) the Company Board shall not submit to
the stockholders of the Company any Competing Proposal, or, except as
permitted herein, propose to do so.

 



40 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall prohibit the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law to the stockholders of the Company (for the avoidance of doubt,
it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in any event, the Company Board shall not make a Change of
Company Recommendation except in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_.

 

(g) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_
by any Company Representative shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_ by the Company.

Section 5.04 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder
Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement
with the SEC. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, the Proxy Statement shall
include the Company Recommendation and the written opinion of Centerview
Partners LLC, dated May 9, 2017, that as of the date of such opinion and
based on and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken
in preparing such opinion as set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares and any Shares held by any affiliate of Parent
prior to the Effective Time). Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement, and shall furnish all information
concerning it, Sub, the Guarantors, the Equity Financing Sources, any of their
affiliates and any transaction any of them have or are contemplating entering
into in connection with this Agreement that is necessary in connection with
the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or any related documents (or in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Company shall
provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall include any comments on such document or response
reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of
the receipt of any written or oral comments to the Proxy Statement from the
SEC or its staff and of any written or oral request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Transactions (including a summary of any oral
conversations).

 



41 (b) If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, the Guarantors, the Equity Financing
Sources, any of their affiliates or any transaction any of them have or are
contemplating entering into in connection with this Agreement, is discovered
by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall as promptly as practicable notify the other
party. Following such notification, the Company shall file with the SEC
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information as
promptly as reasonably practicable after Parent has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (and the Company will include any
comments to such amendment or supplement reasonably proposed by Parent), and,
to the extent the Company determines it is required by applicable Law, the
Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of
the Company.

 

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders,
mail the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders and duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval. Unless a Change of Company Recommendation has occurred, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VII_, its obligations pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of
any Competing Proposal or by the making of any Change of Company
Recommendation.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company may, in its sole discretion, adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting to a date that is no later than thirty (30) days after the
date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled
(provided that any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law
shall not be subject to such limitation), and may change the record date
thereof in connection therewith, in each case (i) to the extent necessary, in
the judgment of the Company Board, to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the
Company a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has
not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting or (iii) to the extent
the Company determines in good faith that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the Companys obligations under applicable Law.

 

Section 5.05 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such a
manner

 



42  as not to interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company,
to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records (and any Tax
Returns and Tax records) thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, Taxes, assets and liabilities
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or
furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith
that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of
attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any confidentiality obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise
breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is party ( _provided_ that the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent to provide
such access or disclosure); or (iii) breach, contravene or violate any
applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law). Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their representatives to, hold all information
provided or furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit
to the business or property sites of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws
and all of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries safety and security
procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.05_, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
none of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct,
without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), any environmental investigation at any real
property owned or leased by the Company, and in no event may any
environmental investigation include any sampling or other intrusive
investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or
in connection with any of such real property.

 

Section 5.06 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, each of Parent and the Company shall
(and Parent shall cause each of its affiliates to) use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Transactions and to cause the conditions set forth
in _Article_ __ _ VI_ to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall (and shall cause Sub and each of Parents or Subs
affiliates to) and the Company shall (and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective affiliates to) use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all actions or nonactions, consents,
Permits (including Environmental Permits), waivers, approvals, authorizations

within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement and (y)
solely with respect to the filings set forth on _Section 5.06(a)_ of the

such a filing, with any Governmental Entity or other persons necessary or
advisable in

 



43  connection with the consummation of the Transactions, including the filings
required of the parties or their "ultimate parent entities" under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, the FCC Approvals and the State PSC Approvals,
and promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary
or advisable, including the furnishing to the FCC or any State PSCs of any
documents, materials or other information requested, (iii) defend all
lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other Proceedings to

Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, in each case until

or the Transactions and (vi) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions.

 

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.06(a)_,
Parent shall promptly take any and all actions necessary or advisable in
order to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the consummation of
the Transactions and to obtain all approvals and consents, including approvals
and consents under any Antitrust Laws, that may be required by any foreign or
U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Transactions as
promptly as practicable, including accepting operational restrictions
or limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license, disposition or holding
separate of, such assets or businesses of Parent, Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates (and the entry
into agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments, injunctions or
orders of the relevant Governmental Entity), in each case, conditioned on the
Closing, as may be required to obtain such approvals or consents of such
Governmental Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of or vacate or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions. Neither Parent nor Sub shall take any
action, including acquiring or making any investment in any person or any
division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
_Article_ __ _ VI_ or the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_
__ _ 5.06_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice
of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, the FCC, any State PSC or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding, each party hereto will permit
authorized representatives of the other parties to be present, to the extent
practicable, at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation or legal Proceeding and to have access to, be consulted in
connection with and, to the extent practicable, provide the opportunity to
review in advance any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to
any Governmental Entity in connection

 



44  with such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding. Each party
hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions. The Company shall, within five (5) Business Days of such
request, provide all information reasonably requested by Parent to determine
the necessity of any regulatory filing necessary to consummate the
Transactions. With respect to each registration, filing and submission made by
any party hereto with the FTC, the Antitrust Division, the FCC, any State
PSC, or any other Governmental Entity, each of Parent and the Company shall
(i) provide the other with all information necessary for the preparation of
such registration, filing or submission on a timely basis, and shall work
diligently to prosecute the applications for such approvals; and (ii) have the
right to review, comment and approve such registration, filing, and
submission; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided to the other
parties may be redacted to remove references to valuation and may, as each
party deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any material
provided to the other under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(c)_ as " _Antitrust
Counsel Only Material_." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
managers of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Parent or Company, as the case may be) or
its legal counsel.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or otherwise, but subject
to the obligation of Parent set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(c)_, (i)
Parent shall determine strategy and timing, lead all proceedings and
coordinate all activities with respect to seeking any actions, non-actions,
terminations or expirations of waiting periods, consents, approvals or
waivers of any Governmental Entity as contemplated hereby, after consultation
with the Company, (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as
reasonably requested by Parent, after consultation with the Company, in
connection with obtaining any such actions, non-actions, terminations or
expirations of waiting periods, consents, approvals or waivers, and (iii)
Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right, after consultation with the
Company, and subject to Parents obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.06(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(b)_, to propose, negotiate, offer or
commit to make or effect any divestitures, dispositions, or licenses of any
assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses, or to agree to
any other remedy, requirement, obligation, condition or restriction to
resolve any Governmental Entitys objections to or concerns about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to do (or cause to
be done) all things necessary or advisable to arrange and obtain the
Financing not later than the date the Closing is required to be effected in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02_, on the terms and conditions (including,
to the extent applicable, the "flex" provisions) described in the Financing
Commitments and any related Fee Letter (or on other terms that, with respect
to conditionality, are not less favorable to Parent or Sub than the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing
Commitments so long as such other terms would not (and would not reasonably be
expected to) have any result, event or consequence described in any of

 



45  clauses (A) through (E) of the immediately succeeding sentence), including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) enter into definitive agreements (which,
with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required
until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt
Financing) with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions (as
such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and
within the limits of the "flex" provisions contained in any Fee Letter)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter (or on
other terms that, with respect to conditionality, are not less favorable to
Parent or Sub than the terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions)
set forth in the Financing Commitments so long as such other terms would not
(and would not reasonably be expected to) have any result, event
or consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (E) of the immediately
succeeding sentence) (the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "), (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable
to Parent or Sub in the Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements that are within their control (or, if deemed advisable by
Parent, seek the waiver of conditions applicable to Parent or Sub contained in
the Financing Commitments or such Definitive Debt Financing Agreements) and
comply with their obligations pursuant to the Financing Commitments, including
with respect to the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees,
(iii) consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing and (iv) enforce their
rights under the Financing Commitments and the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by instituting litigation
in respect thereof). Parent and Sub shall not agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing without the prior written consent of the Company (other than any
amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or any person with similar roles or titles who
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) other
than amendments, modifications or waivers to the Debt Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that would not (and would not be
reasonably expected to) (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
to an amount below the amount necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses (after
taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) unless the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions
or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions in a manner adverse to
Parent or Sub or which would not reasonably be expected to have the result,
effect or consequence described in any of clauses (A), (B), (D) or (E) of
this sentence, to the receipt of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing,
(C) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (D) make the funding of the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing (or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining any of the Financing) less likely to occur or (E) adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or
the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements. Parent and Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the Financing Commitments
(including any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that replace the Financing
Commitments) until the Transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date are
consummated and the repayment or refinancing of any Indebtedness required in
connection with the Transactions required hereunder or under the Financing
Commitments has occurred. Neither Parent nor Sub shall release or consent to
the termination of the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements.

 



46 (b) In no event shall Parent, Sub, the Guarantors or any of their respective
affiliates (which for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ shall be deemed
to include each direct investor in Parent) enter into any Contract prohibiting
or seeking to prohibit any bank or other potential provider of debt financing
from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to any person other than
Parent or Sub in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions (including in
connection with the making of any Competing Proposal).

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, arrange and
obtain from alternative sources of debt financing an amount sufficient to
satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the Equity
Financing and available cash of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or
such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be, on terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) that are at least as favorable to Parent and
Sub as those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
(including the "flex" provisions), which shall not expand upon the conditions
precedent to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in
the Financing Commitments in effect on the date hereof or otherwise adversely
affect the ability or likelihood of Parent and Sub to timely consummate the
Transactions. The new debt commitment letter and fee letter entered into in
connection with such alternative financing are referred to, respectively, as a
" _New Debt Commitment Letter_ " and a " _New Fee Letter_." If Parent or Sub
enters into any such New Debt Commitment Letter, (i) Parent and Sub shall
promptly provide the Company with true, correct and complete copies of such
New Debt Commitment Letter and New Fee Letter (which, in the case of the New
Fee Letter, may be redacted in a manner consistent with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 4.07(a)_), (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing" (and any definition incorporating the term "Debt Financing") shall
mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ below, (iii) any reference in this Agreement
to the "Debt Commitment Letter" (and any definition incorporating the term
"Debt Commitment Letter") shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the
time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in
effect and (iv) any reference in this Agreement to the "Fee Letter" (and any
definition incorporating the term "Fee Letter") shall be deemed to include the
Fee Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Fee Letter at the time in
question and any New Fee Letter to the extent then in effect.

(d) Upon the request of the Company, Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause
their representatives to, keep the Company informed as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in reasonable detail of the
status of their efforts to arrange the Financing. As promptly as practicable
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the execution thereof,
Parent and Sub shall provide copies of all executed Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements to the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies of
any amendments, modifications or supplements to the Financing Commitments, any
Fee Letter (which may be redacted in a manner consistent with the redactions
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ of this Agreement) and any Definitive Debt
Financing Agreement promptly upon their execution and (ii) give the Company
prompt written notice (A) of any default or breach (or any event that, with
or without notice,

 



47  lapse of time or both, would (or could reasonably be expected to) give rise
to any default or breach) by any party under any of the Financing Commitments
or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing of which Parent or Sub
becomes aware, (B) of any termination of either of the Financing Commitments,
(C) of the receipt by Parent or Sub or their respective affiliates of any
written notice or other communication from any Financing Source with respect
to any (1) actual or potential default, breach, termination or repudiation of
any Financing Commitment, any definitive agreement relating to the Financing
or any provision of the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing, in each case by any party thereto, or (2) dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing or make the funding of the
Financing required to satisfy the Financing Uses on the Closing Date less
likely to occur and (D) of the occurrence of an event or development
that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing necessary to satisfy the
Financing Uses on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the
Financing, as the case may be.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ will require, and in no event
will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any material fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter.

(f) Prior to the Closing, at the Parents sole expense as contemplated by
_Section 5.07(i)_ below, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, in each case, use their
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Sub all customary cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent or Sub in connection with the Debt Financing,
including reasonable best efforts to:

(i) prior to and during the Marketing Period, participate (and cause
management of the Company with appropriate seniority and expertise to
participate) in a reasonable number of meetings, calls, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions),
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies and assist Parent in
obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing;

(ii) assist Parent and the Debt Financing Sources with the preparation of
customary rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, lender
presentations, offering documents, offering memoranda, investor presentations
and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing;

(iii) solely with respect to financial information and data derived from the
Companys historical books and records, assist Parent with the preparation of
pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent required by SEC rules and
regulations or necessary or reasonably required by Parent or the Debt
Financing Sources, it being agreed that the Company will not be required to
actually prepare any such pro forma financial information or pro forma
financial statements or provide any

 



48  information or assistance relating to (A) the proposed debt and equity
capitalization or any assumed interest rates, dividends (if any) and fees and
expenses relating to such debt or equity capitalization, (B) any post-Closing
or pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro
forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into any information used in
connection with the Debt Financing or (C) any financial information related
to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any adjustments that are not directly
related to the acquisition of the Company by Parent;

 

(iv) execute and deliver as of the Closing (but not prior to the Closing) any
pledge and security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements,
other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Debt Financing Sources (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect
to solvency matters in the form set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date hereof) and otherwise reasonably facilitate
the pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests in respect
of the Debt Financing, it being understood that such documents will not take
effect until the Effective Time;

(v) (A) as soon as reasonably available, furnish Parent, Sub and the Debt
Financing Sources with the Required Financing Information, provided that no
such Required Financing Information constituting material non-public
information may be publicly disclosed until filed by the Company with the SEC
or otherwise publicly disclosed by the Company, and (B) as promptly as
practicable, inform Parent if the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, treasurer or controller of the Company or any member of the Company
Board shall have knowledge of any facts as a result of which a restatement of
any financial statements to comply with GAAP is probable or under
consideration;

 

(vi) upon reasonable request of Parent, assist Parent to obtain customary and
reasonable consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance
agreements, environmental assessments, surveys and title insurance
commitments;

(vii) at the request of Parent, (A) deliver notices of prepayment (which may
be delivered at Parents request in advance of the Closing Date so long as
they are contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing) within the time
periods reasonably requested by Parent and take any actions at or prior to
the Effective Time reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the prepayment
of all outstanding amounts under any of the Credit Agreements (it being
understood and agreed that any prepayment is (and shall be) contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing and no actions shall be required which would
obligate the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to complete such prepayment
prior to the occurrence of the Closing); (B) arrange for customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and releases and instruments and acknowledgements
of discharge in respect of any of the Credit Agreements to be delivered to
Parent on or prior to the Closing Date (with drafts to be delivered in
advance as reasonably requested by Parent); (C) take all other reasonable
actions (including, without limitation, reasonable best efforts to use cash of
the Company and Company Subsidiaries) to facilitate the payoff, discharge and
termination in full at the Closing of all amounts outstanding under any of
the Credit Agreements; and (D) unwind or novate or assist Parent in connection
with the unwinding or novation of any outstanding interest rate or other swaps
or hedges at the Effective Time designated by Parent (notice of which may be
delivered at Parents request in advance of the Closing Date so long as
permitted by the underlying swap or hedge documentation to be contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing and no actions shall be required which would
obligate the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to complete such unwind or
novation prior to the occurrence of the Closing Date);

 



49 (viii) provide customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors and containing a customary representation to the Debt Financing
Sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including that the public
side versions of such documents do not include material non-public
information about the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their securities
and the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing;

(ix) furnish to Parent and the Debt Financing Sources (A) within 40 days after
the end of any fiscal quarter that is not a fiscal year end, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such quarter and
the related unaudited statements of income and cash flows (which will have
been reviewed by the Companys independent accountants as provided in SAS
100) and (B) within 60 days after the end of any fiscal year, the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such fiscal year
and the related audited statements of income and cash flows;

 

(x) cause its independent auditors to (A) provide, consistent with customary
practice, (x) customary auditors consents and customary "comfort" letters
(including "negative assurance" comfort and change period comfort) with
respect to financial information relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as reasonably requested by Parent or as necessary or customary
for financings similar to the Debt Financing (including any offering or
private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act) and (y) reasonable assistance to Parent in connection with
Parents preparation of pro forma financial statements and information
required pursuant to _clause (f)(iii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ and (B)
attend accounting due diligence sessions required pursuant to _clause (f)(i)_
 of this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_;

(xi) (A) promptly furnish Parent and the Debt Financing Sources at least

Subsidiaries, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent at least eight
(8) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and (B) cooperate reasonably with
the Debt Financing Sources customary securities offering and secured lending
due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable;

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _
5.07_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ to the contrary, (1) in no event shall the
"reasonable best efforts" of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Company Representatives be deemed or construed to require such Persons to,
and such Persons shall not be required, to provide such cooperation to the
extent it would (A) interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (B) require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected
to (x) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default 

 



50  (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries or any Applicable Laws or any material Contract, (y)
cause any condition to Closing set forth in this Agreement to fail to be
satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement that would provide
Parent or Sub the right to terminate this Agreement or seek indemnity under
the terms hereof (unless, in each case, waived by Parent, Sub and, to the
extent required, the Debt Financing Sources), or (z) result in any employee,
officer or director of such Person incurring any personal liability
(as opposed to liability in his or her capacity as an officer of such Person)
with respect to any matters related to the Debt Financing, (2) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action
pursuant to any agreement, certificate or instrument (other than customary
representation letters and authorization letters (including with respect to
the presence or absence of material non-public information and the accuracy
of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related
to the Debt Financing) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter) that is not
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective prior
to the Effective Time, (3) neither the Company Board nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) shall be required to
approve or adopt any Financing or agreements related thereto (or any
alternative financing) prior to the Effective Time (and no such directors
that shall not be continuing directors shall be required to take such action),
(4) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required
to execute or deliver any agreements, certificates or instruments in
connection with any Financing (or any alternative financing) (other than
customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing)) that is not contingent on the
Effective Time, (5) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for any adjustments to any pro forma financial
information required to be provided in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, (6) unless it has received prior reimbursement, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any other payment (other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket costs or expenses that are reimbursed by Parent as provided below in
_Section 5.07(i)_ ) or incur any other liability (other than
customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing) contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter) or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the Effective Time and (7)
nothing contained in this _5.07(i)_ or otherwise shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other
obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.

 

(g) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to
update any Required Financing Information provided to Parent and the Debt
Financing Sources as may be necessary so that such Required Financing
Information (i) is Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set
forth in the definition of "Required Financing Information". For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access the financing
markets, require the cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ at any time, and from time to time and on
multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable
as to each attempt to

 



51  access the markets. The Company agrees to (i) file all reports on Form 10-K
and Form 10-Q and, to the extent required to include financial information
pursuant to Item 9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and (ii) use reasonable best efforts
to file all other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the
time periods required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with
a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent
reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant
to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which Parent
reasonably determines (and the Company does not unreasonably object) to
include in a customary offering document for the Debt Financing, then, unless
the Company reasonably objects, the Company shall file such Current Report on
Form 8-K.

(h) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to
harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries.

(i) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the Financing (including any action taken
in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.07_) and any information utilized
in connection therewith (other than historical information provided in writing
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection
therewith), in each case, except to the extent any of the foregoing was
suffered or incurred as a result of bad faith, gross negligence, willful
misconduct or material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.07 _by the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives.

(j) Each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining
of the Financing or any alternative financing is a condition to the Closing,
and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability
of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject to the applicable
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

 

Section 5.08 _Treatment of Existing Notes_.

 

(a) Parent and Sub will be permitted to commence and conduct one or more
offers to purchase, including any "Change of Control Offer" (as such term is
defined in the applicable Indenture) and any tender offer, or any exchange
offer, and to conduct any consent solicitations (each, a " _Debt Offer_ " and
collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "), with respect to any or all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Companys senior secured notes
(the " _Secured Notes_ ") and the Companys senior unsecured notes (the "
_Unsecured Notes_ " and, together with the Secured Notes, the " _Notes_ ")
identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date
hereof on terms that are acceptable to Parent. Parent shall not be permitted
to 

 



52  commence any applicable Debt Offer until Parent shall have provided the
Company with the necessary offer to purchase, letter of transmittal or other
related documents in connection with the Debt Offer (collectively, the "
_Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable period of time in advance of Parent or
Sub commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its counsel
to review and comment on the related Debt Offer Documents. Parent will
reasonably consult with the Company regarding the timing and commencement of
any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent deadlines. The closing (or,
in the case of consent solicitations, operativeness) of the Debt Offers shall
be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Offers to close on
the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the consummation of a Debt Offer with
respect to any series of Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. The Debt
Offers shall be conducted in compliance with any applicable provisions of the
applicable Indenture and with applicable Law, including SEC rules and
regulations, and the Company shall not be required to cooperate with respect
to any Debt Offer that is not in compliance with the applicable Indenture and
applicable Laws. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to
be provided) immediately available funds for the full payment at the
Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn and any
related consent payments to the extent required pursuant to the terms of any
applicable Debt Offer. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, in each case, use
their reasonable best efforts, at Parents sole expense as contemplated by
clause (d) below, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
applicable Law conflict with this _ Section_ __ _ 5.08_, Parent and the
Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have
breached their obligations under this Agreement by such compliance.

(b) Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents, the Company shall
execute a supplemental indenture to each of (i) that certain Indenture, dated

the applicable Indenture, amending the terms and provisions of each such
Indenture as described in the Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by
Parent, which supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier than
the Effective Time, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
trustee under each such Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture
prior to or substantially simultaneously with the Closing as determined by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any
Company Representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any
amendments or other agreement that would become operative prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and the Company Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the execution of the supplemental indentures. If requested
by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
legal counsel to provide all customary legal opinions required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ to the extent
such legal opinion is required to be delivered prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event

 



53  shall the Company or its legal counsel be required to give an opinion as to
compliance of a Debt Offer with an applicable Law or, if applicable, the
provisions of the applicable Indenture, if in the reasonable opinion of the
Companys legal counsel, the Debt Offer does not comply with such applicable
Law or the provisions of the applicable Indenture, as the case may be, or to
give an opinion with respect to financing by the Parent. 

(c) If requested by Parent in writing, in lieu of or in addition to Parent
commencing or closing a Debt Offer for any series of Notes, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts, to the extent permitted by such series of
Notes and the applicable Indenture, to (A) issue a notice of redemption for
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of
Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the applicable Indenture,
which notice of redemption shall either be issued substantially simultaneously
with the Effective Time or be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the
Closing and (B) take any other actions prior to, at or after the Effective
Time reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of such series of Notes pursuant to the redemption
and the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable Indenture and
the other provisions of such Indenture applicable thereto and the satisfaction
and release of any Liens on the assets of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries arising in connection with such redemption and satisfaction and
discharge; _provided_ , that prior to the Company being required under _clause
(A)_ above to issue any notice of redemption to be issued substantially
simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall have, or shall have
caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the applicable Indenture
sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and discharge. If
a conditional notice of redemption is given, Parent shall ensure that at the
Effective Time, so long as the applicable conditions of such redemption are
satisfied, the Company has all funds necessary in connection with any such
redemption and satisfaction and discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and
discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are
referred to collectively as the "Discharge" of such series of Notes. The
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts, at
Parents sole expense as contemplated by clause (d) below, to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of
any series of Notes identified to the Company by Parent in writing at
any time.

(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for (A) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable outside attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives in
connection with the Debt Offers or Discharge in respect of any series of Notes
and (B) any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives to the trustee or its counsel
pursuant to the applicable Indenture in connection with the Debt Offers or
Discharge in respect of any series of Notes. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any action taken by them in connection
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ except to the extent suffered or incurred as a
result of the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or material
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ by the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Company Representatives.

date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any Company Subsidiary to (i) utilize all or any
portion of the amount available under Section 4.07(a)(3) of either Indenture
(other than amounts thereunder not to exceed $5,000,000), (ii) utilize any of
the following baskets (excepting amounts outstanding pursuant to such baskets
as of the date hereof): (a) Section 4.07(b)(11), 4.09(b)(1) (other than

Liens, Indebtedness or Investment (in each case, as defined in the
Indentures), or any portion thereof, incurred under any provision or clause of
either Indenture on the date hereof to Section 4.07(a)(3), Section
4.07(b)(11), Section 4.09(b)(1), Section 4.09(b)(12)(b), clause (18) of

Liens, or, in the case of the Unsecured Indenture, as a ratio Lien permitted
pursuant to Section 4.12(2)(B) thereof.

Section 5.09 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be a joint press release, the contents of which have received prior approval
from both such parties, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation; _provided_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.09_ shall not apply to any press release, public statement or other
announcement issued or made, or proposed to be issued or made, (a) in
connection with a Competing Proposal or Change of Company Recommendation, (b)
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or (c) that is consistent in

_Section_ __ _ 5.09_ shall limit the ability of the Company to make any
internal announcements to its employees that are consistent in all material
respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any public filings
providing notice to or seeking approval from any Governmental Entity
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ shall be governed by _Section_ __ _
5.06_ and not this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_.

 

Section 5.10 _Directors_ __ _ and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former
director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the
proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the

 



55  Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or
pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing
such persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_. In the event of any
such Indemnified Liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective
Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor
are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request,
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

 

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policy an amount in excess of six (6) times the Maximum Premium. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the
end of such six (6) year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period (and for so
long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend an annual aggregate premium for such
insurance in excess of 250% times the annual aggregate premium currently paid
by the Company for such insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ ").

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, require such
successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent to
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

 



56 (d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
ensure that the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other similar
documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the equivalent
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, as applicable. The
contractual indemnification rights, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without
any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time.

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party,
each Indemnified Partys heirs, executors or administrators and each
Indemnified Partys representatives, shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including
their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified
Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

(f)  _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.
Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries
or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ is not prior to,
or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

Section 5.11 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to restrict or prohibit the Transactions and (b) if any Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the
Transactions, to take all action necessary so that such Transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent
practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transaction. 

Section 5.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the period ending on December
31, 2017, Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to provide (i) base salary and wages to each individual
who is an employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") at a rate that is no less
favorable than the rate of base salary or wages provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus
opportunity or commission opportunity, as applicable, to each Company
Employee that is not less favorable than the annual bonus opportunity or
commission opportunity, as applicable, provided to such

 



57 Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance
benefits to each Company Employee that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided under the severance policy or agreement in effect
for the benefit of such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time and listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.12_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and (iv) other compensation and benefits (including paid-time off, but
excluding long-term incentive compensation opportunities and deferred
compensation benefits) to each Company Employee that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided
to such Company Employee under a Company Benefit Plan set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries employment, severance, retention and
termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including
any change in control or severance agreement between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee), in each case, in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including
with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event) For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall prevent or prohibit
the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any of the foregoing in
accordance with the terms thereof.

(c) For all purposes (including for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting, and benefit accruals) under any
"employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but
without regard to whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any
other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
including any vacation, paid time off and severance plans, each Company
Employees service with or otherwise credited by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in which Company Employees
(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause
to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 



58 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
(i) be treated as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any
employee or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or
any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any
right to enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ or (iii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan, except in accordance with the terms of
such plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such expense; _provided_ , that whether or
not the Merger is consummated, any filing fees required in connection with
the FCC Approvals or the State PSC Approvals shall be shared equally by Parent
and the Company.

 

Section 5.14 _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to take
such actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) by any officer or director of the Company who is
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the Transactions are
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Section 5.15 _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall control, and to the
extent reasonably practicable, the Company shall consult with Parent and keep
Parent reasonably informed with respect to any material developments
regarding, the defense of any Proceeding brought by stockholders of the
Company against the Company or its directors or officers arising out of or
relating to the Transactions after the date hereof (" _Transaction Litigation_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
that the Company shall not settle any such Proceeding without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any Transaction Litigation. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of any Transaction Litigation that is brought or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current
basis with respect to the status and terms thereof.

Section 5.16 _Deregistration; Delisting_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to
applicable Law to cause (a) the delisting of the Shares from the NASDAQ as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration
of the Shares pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
such delisting.

 

Section 5.17 _Notification_. The Company agrees that between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will give prompt notice to
Parent of any failure or reasonably anticipated failure by the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any respect any representation, warranty, covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it

 



59  pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger
set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys unintentional failure to give any
notice under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ shall not be deemed a breach for
purposes of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_). No such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies
available to the parties under this Agreement. Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause

capable of being satisfied at the Second Extended Outside Date, the Outside

that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _

, _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_

such partys failure to comply in any material respect with its obligations
hereunder; or

 

(iii) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any postponement or
adjournment thereof), the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained;

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform or comply with its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ and (ii)
cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of
written notice to the Company of such breach ( _provided_ that Parent is not

63 Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of the valid termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any party or any
Related Party, except, (i) as provided in _ Section 5.07(_ _i_ _)_ ,
_Section 5.08(d)_ , _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ and
_Article_ __ _ VIII_, each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, in each case, in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions and (ii) the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement shall each
survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
its respective terms;  _provided_ , that, subject in all respects to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_, _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.11_,
nothing in this Agreement will relieve (x) any party from any liability for
damages resulting from such partys fraud prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement or (y) the Company from any liability for damages resulting
from the Companys willful breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will
the Parent Related Parties have any liability for monetary damages
(including damages for fraud, monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance or otherwise) in the aggregate in excess of the Parent Termination
Fee and subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in _Section
7.02(_ _i_ _)_ ;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties acknowledge and
agree that the immediately preceding proviso shall not apply to claims, if
any, against any person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination
Fee if: (i) the Company validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_, (ii) Parent validly terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_, (iii) either party validly terminates
this Agreement at such time as Parent could have terminated this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_ or (iv) (A) any person makes a Competing
Proposal (substituting "50%" for each reference in the definition
of "Competing Proposal" to "20%") (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") that was
publicly disclosed or otherwise made publicly known to the Companys
stockholders before the Company Stockholder Meeting and not
publicly withdrawn at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, and thereafter this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ (if the Company Stockholder
Approval has not theretofore been obtained), _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(iii)_ or
_Section 7.01(c_ ) (with respect to a termination because the Company has
breached or failed to perform or comply with its covenants contained in this
Agreement) and (B) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company
enters into a definitive agreement to consummate a Qualifying Transaction, and
a Qualifying Transaction is subsequently consummated (which need not be the
same Qualifying Transaction that was made, disclosed or publicly known prior
to the termination hereof). Any fee due under this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_
shall be paid by wire transfer to the account specified in writing by Parent
of same-day funds on the date of termination pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (_ _i_
_)_ above; within two (2) Business Days after termination pursuant to _clause_
__ _ (ii)_ or _(iii)_ above; or within two (2) Business Days after
consummation of such transaction in the case of termination pursuant to
_clause_ __ _ (iv)_ above.

 



64 (c) Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee if the Company
validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(g)_. Any
fee due under this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_ shall be paid by wire transfer to
the account specified in writing by the Company of same-day funds within two
(2) Business Days after such termination.

(d) If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.02(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_, then the non-paying party will pay or cause to be
paid to the other party (or its designee) the amount due, together with
interest accruing daily on such amount at an annual rate equal to 8.0% from
the date on which such payment was owed.

 

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company
would not enter into this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree
that each of the Parent Termination Fee and the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_,
shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no
event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent (or its designee) more
than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_. In no
event shall Parent be required to pay to the Company more than one Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, but subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 7.02_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ (including, in each case, the
limitations set forth therein), if Parent or Sub fails to effect the Closing
when required by _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ for any or no reason or otherwise
breaches this Agreement or any Transaction Document (whether such breach is
intentional, unintentional, willful or otherwise) or fails to perform
hereunder or thereunder or fails to perform any obligation under Law (in each
case, whether such failure is intentional, unintentional, willful or
otherwise), then the Companys right to (A) a decree or order of specific
performance or any injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief if and
to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, (B) terminate the Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ and seek monetary damages solely on the
basis of fraud by Parent and (C) terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.01(g)_ and if, as and when required pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)_ ,
receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee, shall, together with, if
applicable, the rights of the Company to expense reimbursement or
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 5.07(_ _i_ _)_ , _Section_ __ _ 5.08_
_(d)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ and the rights of the Company under
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_, be the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at Law,
in equity, in Contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company Related
Parties, Company Representatives and any other person against the Parent
Related Parties for any breach, liability, cost, expense, obligation, loss or
damage suffered as a result thereof or in connection therewith or related
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no circumstances can
the Company receive both (i) an award of monetary damages, on the one hand,
and (ii) the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand.

 



65 (g) Except (A) as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.02(f)_ or (B) claims, if any,
against any person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement, no Parent Related Party will
have any liability or obligation to the Company Related Parties, the Company
Representatives or any other person, including any multiple, consequential,
indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages, relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any
documents or certificates referenced herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein or therein, or the failure of such transactions
to be consummated, or in respect of any other Contract, document or theory of
Law or equity or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract,
in tort or otherwise. The Company acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Financing Sources nor any of their former, current and future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or
assignees shall have any liability or obligation to the Company Related
Parties, the Company Representatives or any other person arising out of their
breach or failure to perform (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) any of their obligations under the Financing
Commitments. Without limiting the foregoing, upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_
and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.07(_
_i_ _)_ , _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ _(d)_ , _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ and _Section_ __
_ 7.02(d),_ no Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation to the Company Related Parties, the Company Representatives or any
other person, including any multiple, consequential, indirect, special,
statutory, exemplary or punitive damages, relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any documents referenced
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or
therein, or the failure of such transactions to be consummated, or in respect
of any other Contract, document or theory of Law or equity or in respect of
any representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or otherwise.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, the maximum aggregate liability
of the Parent Related Parties under the Transaction Documents or otherwise
collectively (including monetary damages for fraud or breach, whether
willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise, or monetary damages in lieu
of specific performance), or in connection with the failure of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Financing) to be
consummated, or in respect of any representation made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at Law, in
Contract, in tort or otherwise, together with any payment of the
Parent Termination Fee and any other payment in connection with any
Transaction Document or otherwise, shall not exceed under any circumstances an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the Parent Termination Fee, if any, due and
owing to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02(c)_, _plus_ (ii) the
amounts, if any, due and owing to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.07(_ _i_ _)_ , _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ _(d)_ ,  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(d)_; _provided_ , that (A) in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Parents obligations described in _clause (_ _i_ _)_ of
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(h)_ together with the aggregate amount of Parents
obligations described in _clause (x)_ of the first proviso in _Section_ __ _
7.02(a)_ exceed the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and (B) in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Parents

 



66  obligations described in _clause (ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 7.02(h)_
exceed $1,000,000, and in no event shall the Company Related Parties and the
Company Representatives seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against the
Parent Related Parties, or compel payment by the Parent Related Parties of,
any damages or other payments whatsoever (including multiple, consequential,
indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages) in excess of the
Parent Termination Fee or any of the foregoing limitations (as applicable);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the parties acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing shall not apply to claims, if any, against any person that is party
to, and solely pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by
Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without the
further approval of such stockholders and (b) no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement after the Effective Time. Except as required by Law, no
amendment of this Agreement by the Company shall require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.

 

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
the other contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no
waiver that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without the further approval of such stockholders and (ii) no waiver
shall be made under this Agreement after the Effective Time. Except as
required by Law, no extension or waiver by the Company shall require the
approval of the stockholders of the Company. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure
to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

Section 8.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse

 



68  to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 8.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes,
Exhibits, Company Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter and the other
documents delivered pursuant hereto), the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event of any inconsistency between the Confidentiality Agreement and
the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

 

Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
that Parent and Sub will have the right to assign all or any portion of their
respective rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement (a) to any of
their respective affiliates; or (b) to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to
the terms of the Debt Financing for purposes of creating a security interest
herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing.
Any assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence shall be
void. No assignment by any party hereto will relieve such party of any of
its obligations hereunder.

Section 8.06 _Parties in Interest_. Except for (a) _ Article_ __ _ II_,
which, after the Closing, shall be for the benefit of any person entitled to
payment thereunder, (b) _ Section_ __ _ 5.10_, which, after the Closing,
shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Partys
heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified Partys
representatives, and (c) the right of the holders of Shares to pursue claims
for damages (including damages based on the loss of the economic benefits of
the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to such stockholders)
and other relief, including equitable relief, for a breach by Parent or Sub of
its obligations under this Agreement, each of whom shall be an express third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than
the parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that (i) the persons named in _clauses_ __ _ (a)_ and _(b)_ of this sentence
shall be entitled to enforce their rights under this Agreement and (ii) the
rights granted pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (c)_ of this sentence shall be
enforceable on behalf of the holders of Shares only by the Company, in its
sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by the Company in
connection therewith may be retained by the Company. The parties further
agree that the rights of third-party beneficiaries under _clauses_ __ _ (a)_
and _(b)_ of the preceding sentence shall not arise, unless and until
the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the
sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with

 



69   _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ without notice or liability to any other person. In
some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties. Consequently,
persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, _Section_ __ _ 8.08_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.11_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 8.06_ will inure to the
benefit of the Debt Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each
of whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof (it being
understood and agreed that the foregoing provisions may not be amended in a
manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources in any material respect without
their prior written consent).

 

Section 8.07 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the
context requires: (a) the singular number shall include the plural, and
vice versa; (b) the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders; (c) the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter
genders; and (d) the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine
genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
words of similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Annexes" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in
this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. The term "or"
shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. In this Agreement, references to "as of the date hereof," "as of
the date of this Agreement" or words of similar import shall be deemed to
mean "as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement." The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree that the Financing is the responsibility of
Parent and Sub and not the Company or any Company Subsidiary and that (i) the
Company makes no representations or warranties relating to the Financing
(including whether the Company has authorized the Financing or whether any of
the transactions contemplated by the Financing conflict with or violate any
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party), (ii) except for _Section
5.07(f)_ and _(g)_ and _Sections 5.08(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ , none of the
covenants of the Company in this Agreement require the Company to take any
action relating to the Financing and (iii) for purposes of the representations
and warranties and covenants and obligations of the Company hereunder, the
Transactions shall not include the Financing.

 



70 Section 8.08 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of Law thereof.

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its
successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
itself and with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with
regard to any such Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any Proceeding
relating thereto, except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than
actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree
or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described in this
Agreement. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided in this
