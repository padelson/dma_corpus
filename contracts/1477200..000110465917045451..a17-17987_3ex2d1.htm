 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

This agreement and plan of merger (this " **Agreement** ") is dated July 17,
2017, among Sizmek Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **Parent** "), Fuel
Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" **Merger Sub** "), and Rocket Fuel Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" **Company** "). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes
referred to as a " **Party**." All capitalized terms that are used in this
Agreement have the meanings given to them in Article I.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. It is proposed that Merger Sub commence a tender offer to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the consideration and upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "
**Offer** ").

 



 

B. It is also proposed that, as soon as practicable following the consummation
of the Offer, the Parties will effect the acquisition of the Company by Parent
through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company
being the surviving entity, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement (the " **Merger** ").

 



 

C. The Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and will be
effected as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

D. In connection with the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned
Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) will be automatically converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Price upon the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

E. The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to
enter into this Agreement providing for the Offer and the Merger in accordance
with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
in this Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and (iii)
resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and
tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

F. Each of the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub has (i) declared
it advisable to enter into this Agreement; and (ii) approved the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the performance of their respective covenants and
other obligations under this Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

G. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain Company

      
 

 



 

Stockholders are executing and delivering tender and support agreements in
favor of Parent and Merger Sub in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ (the "
**Tender and Support Agreements** ") pursuant to which those Company
Stockholders will, among other things, agree to tender all outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them to Merger Sub in response
to the Offer.

case, the provisions contained therein are no less restrictive in any material
respect to such counterparty (and any of its Affiliates and representatives
named therein) than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such agreement need not contain any provisions that would
prohibit the making of any Acquisition Proposal to the Company or Company
Board (or committee thereof)); or (ii) any confidentiality agreement entered
into prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

representing more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of the
Company after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other
acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any

result in such Person or Group beneficially owning more than 15% of the total
outstanding voting power of the Company after giving effect to the
consummation of such tender offer or exchange offer;

 



 

(ii) any direct or indirect purchase (including by way of a merger,

of the revenue, net income or consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), where the stockholders of the Company (or
such Subsidiary) prior to the transaction will not own, directly or

 **ARTICLE II** 
**THE** **OFFER**

 



 

2.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. So long as this Agreement has not
been terminated pursuant to Article IX, promptly following the date of this
Agreement, Merger Sub will

 



      
 

 



 

(and Parent will cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all shares of
Company Common Stock (it being understood that the Parties will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to commence the Offer within 10 Business
Days after the date of this Agreement). In the Offer, each share of Company
Common Stock that is accepted by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer will be exchanged for the right to
receive in cash an amount equal to $2.60, without interest thereon (the "
**Per Share Price** ") and subject to any deduction or withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law. The Offer will be made by means of an offer to
purchase (the " **Offer to Purchase** ") that (A) is disseminated to all of
the Company Stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act and
(B) contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
obligations of Merger Sub to accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only
to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub (to the extent permitted
under this Agreement) of:

 



 

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there be validly
tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer a number
of shares of Company Common Stock that, together with the shares of Company
Common Stock then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any), represents in the
aggregate at least one share more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the Offer (excluding shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been "received," as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures) (the "
**Minimum Condition** "); and

 



 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ ((i) and (ii) together,
the " **Offer Conditions** ").

 



 

(b) _Changes to the Offer_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive,
in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the
terms of, or conditions to, the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Merger Sub may not (and Parent will not permit
Merger Sub to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition or any of the conditions set
forth in Sections (1), (3) or (9) of _Exhibit B_ or (ii) make any change in
the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer; (B) decreases the consideration in the
Offer or the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer; (C)
extends the Offer, other than in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.1(c); (D) imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in
_Exhibit B_; or (E) is adverse to the Company Stockholders.

 



 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 



 

(i) _Initial Expiration_. Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in
accordance with this Agreement, the Offer will expire at midnight, Eastern
time, at the end of the day on the date that is the later of (A) 20 Business
Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is first
commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) and (B) the expiration of the Transaction Solicitation Period. If the
Offer is extended pursuant to and in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer will expire on the date and at
the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 



 

(ii) _Extensions_. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1(c)(i) or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to the
Parties respective termination rights under Article IX, (A) Merger Sub will
(and Parent will cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff
thereof or Nasdaq applicable to the Offer or for any period otherwise required
by any Law that is applicable to the Offer; and (B) if any of the Offer
Conditions have not been satisfied or waived as of any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, then Merger Sub will (and Parent will cause Merger
Sub to) extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to 10 Business
Days each in order to permit such Offer Conditions to be satisfied or waived.
Any such extension will not be deemed to impair, limit, or otherwise restrict
in any manner the right of the Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the terms of Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 2.1, Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date
later than the Termination Date or the date of valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(iii) _No Subsequent Offering Period_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will
extend the Offer or provide a "subsequent offering period" within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act in any manner other than
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(c)(ii)
without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

(iv) _No Termination of the Offer_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will
terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the
Offer unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article
IX. Following any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX, Merger Sub will (and Parent will cause Merger Sub to) irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than
one Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Payment for Shares of Company Common Stock_. On the terms and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the Offer, Merger Sub will (and Parent will cause Merger Sub to) accept for
payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock that are validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning
of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration
of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with Section 2.1(c)(ii))
(the time of such acceptance, the " **Acceptance Time** "). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent will provide or cause to be provided
to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of
Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub will
not accept for payment or pay for any shares of Company Common Stock if, as a
result, Merger Sub would acquire less than the number of shares of Company
Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The consideration in
the Offer payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer will be paid net to the
holder thereof in cash, without any interest thereon and subject to any
deduction or withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in respect
thereof.

the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 



 

3.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) _Directors_. The Parties will take all necessary actions so that at the
Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the

hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.

 



 

(b) _Officers_. The Parties will take all necessary actions so that at the
Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the
officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of

appointed.

 



 

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following will occur:

 



 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and each certificate representing ownership of such
shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 



 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time (collectively, the " **Owned Company Shares** ") will be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor; and

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock (excluding Company Restricted Stock)
that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Price, subject to any deduction or withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law and in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery
of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.11).

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
Company Stockholders who have (A) not tendered into the Offer and (B) properly
and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" **Dissenting Company Shares** ") will not be converted into, or represent
the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 3.7. Such
Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted
into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive the Per Share Price, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in Section 3.9.

 



 

(ii) _Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal_. The Company will give
Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and
(B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal Proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. For purposes of this Section 3.7(c)(ii),
"participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and
other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to
the DGCL in respect of

 



      
 

 



 

Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege
between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected)
and may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such demands, but Parent
will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth
above.

 



 

3.8 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and in
accordance with the existing terms of the Company Stock Plans, (i) each
Company Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Company Option that
vests as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to an MRA, as
the result of the holders qualifying termination of employment prior to the
Effective Time) (each, a " **Vested Company Option** ") will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the amount of the Per Share Price
(less the exercise price per share attributable to such Vested Company
Option), multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such Vested Company Option (the " **Vested
Option Consideration** "), which Vested Option Consideration will be paid,
less applicable withholding for all required Taxes, in accordance with Section
3.8(d); (ii) each outstanding Company Option (or portion thereof) that is not
a Vested Company Option or an MRA Award will, without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, vest with respect to
an additional 25% of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
originally subject to such Company Option (provided that in no event will the
vesting of a Company Option accelerate as to more than one hundred percent
(100%) of such Company Option) (the " **Accelerated Company Option** ") and
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Vested
Option Consideration, and any remaining unvested portion of such Company
Option will be cancelled for no consideration, without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof; and (iii) each
outstanding Company Option (or portion thereof) that is an MRA Award and that
is not a Vested Company Option (each, an " **Unvested MRA Option** ") will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, automatically be assumed and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the amount of the
Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such
Unvested MRA Option), multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Unvested MRA Option (the "
**Unvested MRA Option Consideration** "), with payment of such Unvested MRA
Option Consideration to be made less applicable withholding for all required
Taxes. Each payment of Unvested MRA Option Consideration will continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions, including the vesting schedule
applicable to such Unvested MRA Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and any applicable vesting acceleration provisions under the
applicable holders MRA, except as modified by the following sentence,
_provided that_ Unvested MRA Option Consideration payments will be made on the
last Business Day of the calendar quarter in which the Unvested MRA Option to
which an Unvested MRA Option Consideration payment is attributable would have
vested pursuant to the original vesting schedule. On the date that is one (1)
year and one (1) day following the Effective Time (such date, the " **MRA
Award Termination Date** "), any Unvested MRA Option Consideration that
remains unvested as of the MRA Award Termination Date (and has not previously
been forfeited)

 



      
 

 



 

will immediately be forfeited for no consideration, except that if as of
immediately prior to the MRA Award Termination Date, the MRA Award holder
remains in service to the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates but has not
received the amount of Unvested MRA Option Consideration that such MRA Award
holder would have received had the vesting of the Company Option pursuant to
which the related Unvested MRA Option was granted accelerated as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time as to 25% of the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock originally subject to such Company Option (or
if, less, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that remained
unvested as of the Effective Time), the portion of the Unvested MRA Option
Consideration necessary to reach such amount shall vest and become payable
immediately prior to the MRA Award Termination Date. For the avoidance of any
doubt, if a holder of an Unvested MRA Option fails to vest in any portion of
his or her Unvested MRA Option Consideration (including upon the MRA Award
Termination Date), such amounts shall be retained by Parent and forfeited by
such holder for no consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, any Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per
share subject thereto is greater than or equal to the Per Share Price shall be
cancelled for no consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof. From and after the Effective Time, no Vested Company Option,
Accelerated Company Option and/or Unvested MRA Option shall be exercisable,
and a Vested Company Option, Accelerated Company Option or Unvested MRA Option
shall only entitle the holder thereof to the Vested Option Consideration or
Unvested MRA Option Consideration, as applicable, provided in this Section
3.8(a). Each Unvested MRA Option Consideration payment hereunder is intended
to be a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and comply
with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and any ambiguities hereunder
will be interpreted in a manner intended to maintain such exemption from or
compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and in
accordance with the existing terms of the Company Stock Plans, (i) each
Company Restricted Stock award (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and is
not an MRA Award will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, vest with respect to an additional 25% of
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock originally subject to such
Company Restricted Stock award (provided that in no event will the vesting of
a Company Restricted Stock award accelerate as to more than one hundred
percent (100%) of such Company Restricted Stock award) (the " **Accelerated
Restricted Stock Award** ") and automatically be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the Per
Share Price, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Accelerated Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " **Vested Restricted Stock Consideration** "), which
Vested Restricted Stock Consideration will be paid, less applicable
withholding for all required Taxes, in accordance with Section 3.8(d); (ii)
each outstanding Company Restricted Stock award (or portion thereof) that is
not an Accelerated Restricted Stock Award or an MRA Award will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled for no consideration; and (iii) each outstanding Company
Restricted Stock award (or portion thereof) that is an MRA Award (each, an "
**MRA Restricted Stock Award** ") will, without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, automatically be
assumed and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to (A) the Per Share Price, multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such MRA Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time (the " **MRA Restricted Stock Consideration** "), with payment
of such MRA Restricted Stock Consideration to be made less applicable
withholding for all required Taxes. Each payment of MRA Restricted Stock
Consideration will continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions,
including the vesting schedule applicable to such MRA Restricted Stock Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and any applicable vesting
acceleration provisions under the applicable holders MRA, except as modified
by the following sentence, _provided that_ MRA Restricted Stock Consideration
payments will be made on the last Business Day of the calendar quarter in
which the MRA Restricted Stock Award to which an MRA Restricted Stock
Consideration payment is attributable would have vested pursuant to the
original vesting schedule. On the MRA Award Termination Date, any MRA
Restricted Stock Consideration that remains unvested as of the MRA Award
Termination Date (and has not previously been forfeited) will immediately be
forfeited for no consideration, except that if as of immediately prior to the
MRA Award Termination Date, the MRA Award holder remains in service to the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates but has not received the amount of MRA
Restricted Stock Consideration that such MRA Award holder would have received
had the vesting of the Company Restricted Stock award pursuant to which the
related MRA Restricted Stock Award was granted accelerated as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time as to 25% of the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock originally subject to such Company Restricted Stock award (or if,
less, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that remained
unvested as of the Effective Time), the portion of the MRA Restricted Stock
Consideration necessary to reach such amount shall vest and become payable
immediately prior to the MRA Award Termination Date. For the avoidance of any
doubt, if a holder of an MRA Restricted Stock Award fails to vest in any
portion of his or her MRA Restricted Stock Consideration (including upon the
MRA Award Termination Date), such amounts shall be retained by Parent and
forfeited by such holder for no consideration. From and after the Effective
Time, a MRA Restricted Stock Award shall only entitle the holder thereof to
the MRA Restricted Stock Consideration provided in this Section 3.8(b). Each
MRA Restricted Stock Consideration payment hereunder is intended to be a
separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and comply with or
be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and any ambiguities hereunder will be
interpreted in a manner intended to maintain such exemption from or compliance
with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(c) _Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and in accordance
with the existing terms of the Company Stock Plans, (i) each Company RSU (or
portion thereof), that is outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any Company RSU that vests as of or immediately
prior to the Effective Time (x) pursuant to an MRA, as the result of the
holders qualifying termination of employment prior to the Effective Time, or
(y) with respect to any Company RSU that was subject to performance-based
vesting conditions as of the date of grant but is now subject to time-based
vesting conditions only, pursuant to the applicable Company RSU agreement)
(each, a " **Vested RSU** ") will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, automatically be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (A) the Per Share Price, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Vested RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " **Vested RSU Consideration** "), which Vested RSU Consideration
will be paid, less applicable withholding for all required Taxes, in
accordance with Section 3.8(d), and to the extent a Company RSU remains
subject to performance conditions, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Vested RSU will be determined based on actual
performance in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the existing terms of the applicable Company RSU agreement,
and any Company RSUs for which the performance conditions are not satisfied as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking into account any
acceleration that would occur immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time)
will be cancelled for no consideration, without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, and, for the avoidance
of doubt, will not accelerate as set forth in the following clause (ii); (ii)
each outstanding Company RSU (or portion thereof) that is not a Vested RSU or
an MRA Award will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, vest with respect to an additional 25% of the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock originally subject to such
Company RSU (provided that in no event will the vesting of a Company RSU
accelerate as to more than one hundred percent (100%) of such Company RSU)
(the " **Accelerated RSU** ") and automatically be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive the Vested RSU Consideration, and any remaining
unvested portion of such Company RSU will be cancelled for no consideration,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof; and (iii) each outstanding Company RSU (or portion thereof)
that is an MRA Award and that is not a Vested RSU (each, an " **MRA Unvested
RSU** ") will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, automatically be assumed and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the Per
Share Price, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such MRA Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
" **MRA Unvested RSU Consideration** "), with payment of such MRA Unvested RSU
Consideration to be made less applicable withholding for all required Taxes.
Each payment of MRA Unvested RSU Consideration will continue to be governed by
the same terms and conditions, including the vesting schedule applicable to
such MRA Unvested RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and any
applicable vesting acceleration provisions under the applicable holders MRA,
except as modified by the following sentence, _provided that_ MRA Unvested RSU
Consideration payments will be made on the last Business Day of the calendar
quarter in which the MRA Unvested RSU to which an MRA Unvested RSU
Consideration payment is attributable would have vested pursuant to the
original vesting schedule. On the MRA Award Termination Date, any MRA Unvested
RSU Consideration that remains unvested as of the MRA Award Termination Date
(and has not previously been forfeited) will immediately be forfeited for no
consideration, except that if as of immediately prior to the MRA Award
Termination Date, the MRA Award holder remains in service to the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates but has not received the amount of MRA Unvested
RSU Consideration that such MRA Award holder would have received had the
vesting of the Company RSU award pursuant to which the related MRA Unvested
RSU was granted accelerated as of immediately prior to the Effective Time as
to 25% of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock originally
subject to such Company RSU award (or if, less, the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock that remained unvested as of the Effective Time), the
portion of the MRA Unvested RSU Consideration necessary to reach such amount
shall vest and become payable immediately prior to the MRA Award Termination
Date. For the avoidance of any doubt, if a holder of an MRA Unvested RSU fails
to vest in any portion of his or her MRA Unvested RSU Consideration (including
upon the MRA Award Termination Date), such amounts shall be retained by Parent
and forfeited by such holder for no consideration. From and after the
Effective Time, a MRA Unvested RSU shall only entitle the holder thereof to
the MRA Unvested RSU Consideration provided in this Section 3.8(c). Each MRA
Unvested RSU Consideration payment hereunder is intended to be a separate
"payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and comply with or be
exempt from Section 409A of the

 



       
 

 



 

Code, and any ambiguities hereunder will be interpreted in a manner intended
to maintain such exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(d) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate Vested Option Consideration, Vested Restricted
Stock Consideration and Vested RSU Consideration owed to all holders of Vested
Company Options, Accelerated Company Options, Accelerated Restricted Stock
Awards, Vested RSUs and Accelerated RSUs respectively. Within five Business
Days of the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Vested Company Options,
Accelerated Company Options, Accelerated Restricted Stock Awards, Vested RSUs
and Accelerated RSUs will receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts
required to be paid to such holders in respect of such Vested Company Options,
Accelerated Company Options, Accelerated Restricted Stock Awards, Vested RSUs
and Accelerated RSUs, respectively, that are cancelled and converted pursuant
to Section 3.8. All such payments will be less any applicable withholding
Taxes.

 



 

(e) _Further Actions_. The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) will take all action reasonably necessary to effect the cancellation
or assumption, as applicable, of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company
Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 3.8
(including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act). The Company will ensure that following the Effective
Time no participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan
will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) _Treatment of ESPP_. With respect to the ESPP, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to
provide that each individual participating in the Offering Period (as defined
in the ESPP) in progress on the date of this Agreement will not be permitted
to (i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from
the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement; or (ii)
make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date
of this Agreement that have the effect of increasing his or her contribution
rate in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, in each case,
except as may be required by applicable Law. No individual who is not
participating in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement will be allowed to
commence participation in the ESPP following the date of this Agreement. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action that may be necessary
to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause any Offering
Period that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time to be
terminated no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the
Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary
to reflect the shortened Offering Period, but otherwise treat such shortened
Offering Period as a fully effective and completed Offering Period for all
purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than one
Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each
outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no
further Offering Period will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the date of
this Agreement. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds
credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to
the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.

 



 

3.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent will (i) select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent in the Offer and the Merger (the " **Payment Agent** "); and
(ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section
2.1(d) and Section 3.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration
to which such Company Stockholders become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d)
and Section 3.7; provided, that the Company shall, at the written request of
Parent, deposit with the Payment Agent at the Effective Time (or as promptly
as practicable thereafter) a portion of such aggregate consideration, from the
Companys Cash on Hand as specified in such request. Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be
invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash
and any proceeds thereon, the " **Exchange Fund** "). To the extent that (A)
there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B)
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.1(d)
and Section 3.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable
for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by Section 2.1(d) and Section 3.7 for any reason, then
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained
at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated
by Section 2.1(d) and Section 3.7. Any interest or other income from
investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs.

 



 

(c) _Exchange and Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event
within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause
the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the " **Certificates** ")
whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the consideration

 



      
 

 



 

payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.7, (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.7. Upon
surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of a Certificate as provided in Section 3.11) for cancellation, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in
accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of
such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of
shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by
(2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The
Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on
the amount payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this
Section 3.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.7.

 



 

(ii) _Uncertificated Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ") will not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to
receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.7.
In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other
than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.7 will, upon
receipt of an "agents message" in customary form (it being understood that
the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such
Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an "agents message" or such other
evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the
Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the Payment
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be
cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any
holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender
of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 3.9(c)(ii). Until so
surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.7(a).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and DTC with the
objective that the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the
first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, equal to (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares)
held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
multiplied by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the " **DTC Payment** ").

 



 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor
are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 3.7 may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to
Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such
Uncertificated Shares are registered.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not
been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Section 3.9 will thereafter look for payment of the
Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.7.

 



 

3.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b)
each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated

 



      
 

 



 

Shares previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 3.7 (or in the case
of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 3.7(c)). The
consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article III upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to
compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 3.9(c)) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.

 



 

3.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue
in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 3.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

3.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation, or any Affiliate of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

3.13 _Future Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 



 

3.14 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company
and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all
such lawful and necessary action.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

With respect to any Section of this Article IV, except (a) as disclosed in the
reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC or
furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case, pursuant to the Exchange
Act on or after January 1, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement (other
than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk
Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other disclosures contained or
referenced therein of information, factors or risks that are predictive,
cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the " **SEC Reports** ") (it being
acknowledged that nothing disclosed in the SEC Reports will be deemed to
modify or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.7
or the second sentence of Section 4.12(a)); or (b) as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b)
has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties and assets owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of
any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the Charter and the Bylaws, each as amended to date. The Company is
not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.

 



 

4.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform its
covenants and obligations under this Agreement; and (c) consummate the Offer
and the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger have each been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company
and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company (other than the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware) are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations under this Agreement; or (iii) the consummation of the Offer
and the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability (A) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally; and (B) is subject to general
principles of equity (the limitations set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above,
collectively, " **Enforceability Limitations** ").

 



      
 

 



 

4.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 



 

(a) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board has (i) determined that it is

Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; (ii) approved the Agreement and the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
other obligations in this Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that
the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer (collectively, the "
**Company Board Recommendation** "), which Company Board Recommendation has
not been withdrawn, rescinded or modified in any way as of the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board received the written opinion (or an
oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of the Company Financial Advisor to
the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to
the various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share
Price to be received by the Company Stockholders (other than Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent, if applicable) pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders (it being understood and agreed that
such opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied
upon by Parent or Merger Sub).

 



 

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.6 are true and correct, the Company Board
has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be applicable to the Offer, the
Merger, the Tender and Support Agreements or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

4.4 _No Stockholder Approval Required_. Assuming that the requirements of
Section 251(h) of the DGCL are met with respect to the Offer and the Merger,
no vote of the Company Stockholders or other capital stock of the Company is
necessary to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Offer and the Merger
under applicable Law, the Charter or the Bylaws.

 



 

4.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations under
this Agreement, and the consummation of the Offer and the Merger do not (a)
violate or conflict with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws or the
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any "significant
subsidiary" of the Company (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X
promulgated by the SEC); (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of,
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of, accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in Section 4.6, violate or conflict with any Law
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound; or (d) result in the creation of
any lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

 



      
 

 



 

except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or liens that would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No Consent, authorization of, filing
or registration with, or notification to any Governmental Authority is
required on the part of the Company in connection with the (a) execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (b) performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) consummation
of the Merger, except (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental
Authorities to satisfy the applicable Laws of states in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business; (ii) such filings and approvals
as may be required by any federal or state securities Laws, including
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; (iii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws; and (iv) such other Consents the failure of which to
obtain would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(a) _Capital Stock_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
(i) 1,000,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock; and (ii) 100,000,000 shares

4.8 _Subsidiaries_.

true, correct and complete list of the name and jurisdiction of organization
of each Subsidiary of the Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly

standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United
States); and (ii) has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its respective business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease
or operate its respective properties and assets, except where the failure to

Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or
leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to
the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of
any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete

indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all liens (other than Permitted
Liens) and any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to

voting interest) that would prevent such Subsidiary from conducting its
business as of the Effective Time in substantially the same manner that such
business is conducted on the date of this Agreement.

securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or

into or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company; or (iii) obligations of any
Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,

4.9 _Company SEC Reports_. Since January 1, 2014, the Company has filed with
or furnished to the SEC all forms, reports and documents that have been
required to be filed by it pursuant to applicable Laws prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " **Company SEC Reports** "). Each Company SEC Report
complied as to form, as of its filing date, or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing made prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, each as in effect on
the date that such Company SEC Report was filed. True, correct and complete
copies of all Company SEC Reports are publicly available in the Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval database of the SEC. As of its filing
date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, on the date of such amended or superseded filing), each Company SEC
Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any forms,
reports or documents with the SEC.

 



 

4.10 _Company Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) _Company Financial Statements_. The consolidated financial statements of
the Company and its Subsidiaries filed with the Company SEC Reports (i) were

respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates

maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" and "internal control over
financial reporting" (in each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule
15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Companys disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such system was
effective. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has
issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report
concluding that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. Since December 31, 2016 and
through the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, no events
have occurred such that management would not be able to complete its
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, and conclude,
after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since January 1, 2014,
the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the
Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has
received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications.

 



 

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls that are effective in all material respects in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
including policies and procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of the Companys management and the
Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm has
identified or been made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material
weakness (each as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) in the system
of internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries that has not been subsequently remediated; or

 



      
 

 



 

(B) any fraud that involves the Companys management or other employees who
have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the internal control
over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Reports.

 



 

(d) _Indebtedness_. Section 4.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains
a true, correct and complete list of all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, other than Indebtedness
reflected in the Audited Company Balance Sheet or otherwise included in the
Company SEC Reports.

 



 

4.11 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities of a nature required to be reflected or
reserved against on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, other
than liabilities (a) reflected or otherwise reserved against in the Audited
Company Balance Sheet or in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto) included in the
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement; (b) arising
pursuant to this Agreement or incurred in connection with the Offer and the
Merger; (c) incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31,
2016; or (d) that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.12 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

 



 

(a) _No Company Material Adverse Effect_. Since January 1, 2017, through the
date of this Agreement, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
been conducted, in all material respects, in the ordinary course of business.
Since the date of the Audited Company Balance Sheet through the date of this
Agreement, there has not occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Forbearance_. Since January 1, 2017, through the date of this Agreement,
the Company has not taken any action that would be prohibited by Section
6.2(a) (except for Section 6.2(a)(iii), Section 6.2(a)(ix), Section
6.2(a)(xiv) and, with respect to the foregoing sections, Section 6.2(a)(xix))
if taken or proposed to be taken after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

4.13 _Material Contracts_.

 



 

(a) _Material Contracts_. Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains a true, correct and complete list of all Material Contracts to or by

clause (i) of the definition of Material Contract; (2) all sales orders,
purchase orders, insertion orders, statements of work, amendments and
addendums contemplated by clauses (ii) and (iv) of the definition of Material

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2016, and (B) with the 25 largest vendors of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, determined on the basis of payments made by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2017; and (4) any Material Contracts listed in Section 4.14(b),
Section 4.14(c) Section 4.16(d), and Section 4.18(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter), and a true, correct and complete copy of each Material Contract has
been made available to Parent. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
Contracts of the type contemplated by clause (iv) of the definition of
Material Contract other than those Contracts set forth in Section 4.13(a)(iv)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) _Validity_. Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company or
each such Subsidiary of the Company party thereto and is in full force and

jurisdiction that has not been resolved.

its Subsidiaries to any compensation or benefit; (ii) accelerate the time of

exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or Sponsor pursuant to the Equity Commitment
Letter; or (ii) constitute or result in a failure on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or Sponsor to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition of the Equity Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not
such term or condition is contained in the Equity Commitment Letter (it being
understood that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties in Article IV). As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees
that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement, in each
case pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter.

Contract, or has authorized, made or entered into, or committed or agreed to
enter into, any formal or informal arrangements or other understandings

this Agreement or the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment)

their current needs) or sell products or services in quantities that are
outside of the ordinary course of business relative to the prior year of sales

6.3 _Transaction Solicitation Period_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on August 16, 2017 (the " **Transaction Solicitation
Period** "), the Company may, directly or indirectly, including with the
assistance of investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
Representatives of the Company, (i) actively solicit, initiate, propose or
induce the making, submission, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,
any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) participate, or engage in discussions or
negotiations, with any Person with respect to, or that may be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal, and in connection with such efforts, the Company may authorize its
or any of its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents or other
Representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by the Company or by any of the Subsidiaries of the Company),
directly or indirectly, to solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making,
submission, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or otherwise assist, efforts by
any Person or group (each a " **Prospective Acquirer** ") to decide whether to
make an Acquisition Proposal. Any Prospective Acquirer with whom the Company
has active discussions with respect to an Acquisition Proposal at any time
during the Transaction Solicitation Period shall be an " **Excluded Party** "
for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) During the Transaction Solicitation Period, the Company may provide non-
public information about the Company and its Subsidiaries to Prospective
Acquirers, but the Company will not provide, or authorize anyone to provide,
non-public information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a
Prospective Acquirer unless the Prospective Acquirer enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Company. If the Company provides to any
Prospective Acquirer non-public information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that the Company has not provided to Parent, the Company will as
promptly as practicable provide that non-public information to Parent.

 



 

(c) If at any time during the Transaction Solicitation Period the Company
Board is presented with or receives a bona fide, written or oral Acquisition
Proposal from a Prospective Acquirer, then the Company shall promptly (and, in
any event, within 24 hours from the receipt thereof ) advise Parent in writing
of such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal (including any material amendments thereto) and the
identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal (unless any
such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person that is in effect on the date of this Agreement)
and copies of all relevant proposed agreements and financing commitments (to
the extent provided to the Company) relating to such Acquisition Proposal.
Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis, of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any
material amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
complying with this Section 6.3(c).

 



 

6.4 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Subject to the terms of Section 6.4(b),
from the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period until the earlier to occur
of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and (2)
Acceptance Time, the Company will cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other
access to diligence) of, any Person and its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors (collectively, "
**Representatives** ") relating to an Acquisition Transaction. Unless the
Company has already so requested prior to the expiration of the Transaction
Solicitation Period, promptly following the expiration of the Transaction
Solicitation Period, the Company will request that each Person (other than
Parent and its Representatives and any Excluded Parties) that has, prior to
the expiration of the Transaction Solicitation Period, executed a

 



      
 

 



 

confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an
Acquisition Transaction, promptly return or destroy, in accordance with the
terms of such confidentiality agreement, all non-public information furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
expiration of the Transaction Solicitation Period. Subject to the terms of
Section 6.4(b) and Section 6.4(d), from the end of the Transaction
Solicitation Period until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article IX and (2) Acceptance Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and their respective directors and executive officers, will not,
and the Company will not authorize, direct, permit or instruct any of its or
its Subsidiaries employees, consultants or other Representatives to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission
or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal
that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective designees) any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective designees), in any such case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate
or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate,
or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons
relating to the making of an Acquisition Proposal (other than only informing
such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 6.4); (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract
relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an " **Alternative Acquisition
Agreement** "); or (vi) authorize, resolve or commit to do any of the
foregoing. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
(1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and (2) Acceptance
Time, the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to
waive, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the
extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential
proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee thereof).

 



 

(b) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section
6.4, from the date of this Agreement until the Acceptance Time, the Company
and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly
through one or more of their Representatives (including the Company Financial
Advisor), following the execution of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
(i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (ii) furnish
any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to; or (iii) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records
or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, in each case, any Person or its Representatives that has
made or delivered to the Company a written Acquisition Proposal after the date
of this Agreement that was not solicited in material breach of Section 6.4(a),
but only if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a

 



      
 

 



 

Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and
(B) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 6.4(b) would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company will as promptly as practicable
make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives
that was not previously made available to Parent.

 



 

(c) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 6.4(d), at no time after
the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee thereof):

 



 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent; (B) adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the
Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days of the occurrence of a
material event or development and after Parent so requests in writing; (D)
take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any
recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th Business
Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of
this Section 6.4); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "
**Company Board Recommendation Change** "), it being understood that none of
(1) the determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to,
a Superior Proposal; (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of
any notice contemplated by Section 6.4(d); or (3) the public disclosure in
itself of the foregoing (1) or (2) if required by applicable Law will
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 6.4;
or

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time:

 



 

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law if and only if:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least two
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 6.4(d)(i), which notice will
describe the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

 



 

(B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such two Business Day period, have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;
and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the
Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect
thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); or

 



 

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal,
whether during or after the Transaction Solicitation Period, that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal,
then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
with respect to such Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in
each case if and only if:

 



 

(A) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable Law;

 



 

(B) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.4 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; and

 



 

(C) (x) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four
Business Days in advance (the " **Notice Period** ") to the effect that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.4(d)(ii) absent revision to the terms of this
Agreement as contemplated by clause (y)(1) of this Section 6.4(d)(ii)(C),
which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation
Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making
such Acquisition Proposal (unless any such disclosure is prohibited pursuant
to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that
is in effect on the date of this Agreement), the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal and copies of all relevant proposed agreements and
financing

 



      
 

 



 

commitments (to the extent provided to the Company) relating to such
Acquisition Proposal; and (y) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives,
during the Notice Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments
with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any material
revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 6.4(d)(ii)(C) with respect to such new written notice (with the
"Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice being two Business
Days); and (b) at the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) must have in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) _Notice to Parent_. From the end of the Transaction Solicitation Period
until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article IX and (2) Acceptance Time, the Company will as promptly as
practicable notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal, or inquiry from any
Person or Group related to their making a potential Acquisition Proposal, is,
to the Knowledge of the Company (which, for this purpose, will be deemed to
include any member of the Company Board and will not be deemed to be only as
of the date of this Agreement) received by, any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must
include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal, inquiry,
request or offer (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms
of any confidentiality agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect
on the date of this Agreement) and (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if in writing, a
copy thereof. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on
a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals
(including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
complying with this Section 6.4(e).

 



 

(f) _Permitted Disclosures_. So long as the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure (other than in a customary "stop, look and listen" communication to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act):

 



 

(i) nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) from (A) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
including making a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar

 



      
 

 



 

communication); (B) complying with Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; (C) informing any Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this Section 6.4; or (D) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof), after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, has determined in good faith is required by applicable Law; provided,
that, it is understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit
the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with Section 6.4(d); and

 



 

(ii) it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a
factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) that (A) describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal; (B) identifies the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal;
(C) provides the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) describes
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in any case, be
deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal, amendment, qualification or
modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board Recommendation Change;

 



 

(g) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that (a) any action taken
by a Representative of the Company (other than an executive officer or
director of the Company) that is authorized, permitted, directed or instructed
by the Company or any executive officer or director of the Company or that an
executive officer or director of the Company is made aware of and does not
take action to cease and that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a
material breach of this Section 6.4, will be deemed to constitute a breach by
the Company of this Section 6.4, and (b) any action taken by any executive
officer or director of the Company and that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this Section 6.4, will be deemed to constitute a breach
by the Company of this Section 6.4.

 



 

6.5 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended to
give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or
operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent with
the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over their respective businesses and operations.

(B) do (or cause to be done) all things; and (C) assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing (or causing to be done) all things, in each case as are

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, neither Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any

reasonably be expected to have) the effect of preventing, impairing, delaying
or otherwise adversely affecting the (i) consummation of the Offer and the
Merger; or (ii) ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations
pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the

Antitrust Laws applicable to the Offer or the Merger. If any Party receives a

consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request.

and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Offer and the Merger
pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Offer
or the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates,
if applicable) will (i) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license
or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or

businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand; and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (ii) contest,
defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub will (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Law, (i)
promptly notify the other Parties of (and, if in writing, furnish them with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise them of the contents
of)) any material communication received by such Person from a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Offer or the Merger and permit the other
Parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed draft

communications (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations,
correspondence or other documents submitted therewith) made in connection with
the Offer or the Merger to a Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other
Parties reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions
and filings to any Governmental Authority in connection with the Offer or the

non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver; (B) the expiration
of any waiting period; (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened
commencement of any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial
action or proceeding under applicable Law; and (D) the nature and status of

independently participate in any meeting, hearing, proceeding or material
discussions with or before any

 



       
 

 



 

Governmental Authority in respect of the Offer or the Merger without giving
the other Parties reasonable prior notice of such meeting, hearing, proceeding
or material discussion, and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such
information will not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party
without approval of the Party providing the non-public information. Each of

information before sharing any information provided to any Governmental
Authority with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis.

 



 

7.3 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) _No Amendments to Equity Commitment Letter_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing; (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Equity Financing or any other terms to the
Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or
prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Equity
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Equity
Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter. Any reference
in this Agreement to (1) the "Equity Financing" will include the financing
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 7.3; and (2) "Equity Commitment Letter" will
include such document as amended or modified in compliance with this Section
7.4.

 



 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions and to do (or cause to
be done) all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the
Equity Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Equity

will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement
action against any source of the Equity Financing to enforce its rights
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent and
Merger Sub will seek to enforce, including by bringing suit for specific
performance, the Equity Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted
a decree of specific performance of the obligation to consummate the

(vii) reasonably facilitating the pledging or the reaffirmation of the pledge

is reasonably requested by Parent, in accordance with the requirements of the
Financing Sources, relating to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this Section 7.4 will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any
definitive agreement; (iii) give any indemnities in connection with the Debt

obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

and marketing materials related to the Debt Financing)) that is not contingent
on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the
Effective Time; and (C) any bank information memoranda and high-yield offering
prospectuses or memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will
contain disclosure and financial statements reflecting the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this Section 7.4
will require (1) (i) any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or deliver any definitive debt documents or any other
related documents, certificates or opinions in connection with the Debt
Financing or (ii) any Representative of any of the Companys Subsidiaries to
deliver any definitive debt documents or certificates or opinions or take any
other action under this Section 7.4 that could reasonably be expected to
result in personal liability to such Representative; (2) the Company Board to
approve any financing or Contracts related thereto; (3) the Company and its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate its
organizational documents, any applicable Laws or result in a violation of
breach of, or default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of it
is Subsidiaries is a party; and (4) the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide any information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or

(ii) violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right
terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound.

goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection
with a description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger;
and (iii) in a manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the
Company reasonably imposes.

 



 

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (and, in

 



      
 

 



 

each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons
(i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto;
or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

 



 

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will
reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 7.4.

 



 

(f) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with
their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement
or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith. Parents
obligations pursuant to Section 7.4(e) and this Section 7.4(f) are referred to
collectively as the " **Reimbursement Obligations**."

 



 

(g) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Sponsor, Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be
deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the
Financing Sources or potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and
such investors) enter into any Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker,
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank,
investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing
or seeking to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any
Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

(h) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Offer or the
Closing. If the Debt Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub
will each continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ and Article VIII, to consummate the
Offer and the Merger, respectively.

 



 

7.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" Law is or becomes
applicable to the Offer, the Merger, the Tender and Support Agreements or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and (b) if any "anti-
takeover" Law becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger, the Tender and
Support Agreements or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
take all action within their power to ensure that Offer, the Merger, the
Tender and Support Agreements and the other transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on the Offer, the Merger, the Tender and Support Agreements and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, as applicable.

 



 

7.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
(1) termination of this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to Article IX and (2) Effective Time, the Company will afford Parent
and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel
of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable
Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would
give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or
information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the
rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure
of any Trade Secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or information
are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the
other hand. Nothing in this Section 7.6 will be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 7.6 will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to
perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its
Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this Section 7.6. All requests for access pursuant to
this Section 7.6 must be directed to the Companys General Counsel or another
person designated in writing by the Company.

 



 

7.7 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by
each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be
exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

7.8 _Rule 14d-10._ The Parties acknowledge that certain payments have been
made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be
granted according to employment compensation, severance and other employee
benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans
(collectively, the " **Arrangements** "), to certain Company Stockholders and
holders of Company Options and Company Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors (the " **Company Compensation
Committee** ") (a) at a meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will
duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
under the Exchange Act (i) each Arrangement presented to the Company

(iii) the terms of Section 7.9 and Section 7.10; and (b) will take all other
actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing
arrangements. Each member of the Company

requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

7.9 _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective
current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time), on the other hand (collectively, the " **Indemnified Persons** ") or
employees for any acts or omissions by such Indemnified Persons or employees
occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation
and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws
and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year
period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of Section
7.9(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and
against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with
any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (to the extent that such action or omission,
or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective
Time); and (ii) the Offer or the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition
of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is
alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section
7.9(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving
Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to
object to the Indemnified

 



      
 

 



 

Persons entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement with respect
thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving
Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification,
the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees
and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no
Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding
effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement
relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is
entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of,
any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent
or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons
from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination
required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified
Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by
independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel
will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the DandO Insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section
7.9(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the " **Maximum Annual Premium** "). If
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier.
Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the DandO Insurance
pursuant to this Section 7.9(c), the Company may (or, if the Parent requests,
the Company will) purchase a prepaid "tail" policy (a " **Tail Policy** ")
with respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance carrier so long as the annual cost for a Tail Policy does
not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases a Tail Policy
prior to the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such a Tail Policy in full
force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long
as such a Tail Policy is in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the

 



      
 

 



 

continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each case, proper provisions will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 7.9.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section 7.9 may not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and their heirs and
representatives) who is a beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or a Tail
Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person
or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and their
heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance
or a Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section
7.9, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and their heirs and representatives)
who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or a Tail Policy) pursuant
to this Section 7.9 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and
Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section
7.9 will be joint and several.

 



 

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7.9 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

 



 

7.10 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Change of Control Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees
that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of
the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Acceptance
Time.

 



 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Acceptance Time, the Company
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the
Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.10 will
prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms or as otherwise permitted under applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. Immediately following the Closing, the employment
of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
will continue with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. For a
period of one year following the Effective Time (or until the Continuing
Employees termination, if shorter), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) provide each Continuing Employee with (i) severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee under the existing terms of an
applicable Company Benefit Plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) base compensation
that is no less favorable than the base compensation provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee as of the date of this
Agreement, and (iii) group medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and
dismemberment and disability benefits (" **Group Welfare Benefits** ") that
are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee as of the date of
this Agreement, unless the costs to the Company or its Affiliates to provide
such Group Welfare Benefits materially increase, in which case, Continuing
Employees will be provided Group Welfare Benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to the Group Welfare Benefits provided by Parent and
its Affiliates to their similarly situated employees.

 



 

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that an employee benefit plan is made available
to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing
Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(other than vesting of future equity awards) and for purposes of vacation
accrual and severance pay entitlement, to the same extent such service was
recognized for similar purposes under the Company Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the Closing, except that such service need not be credited to the
extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Benefit Plans) (such plans, the " **New Plans** ") to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Acceptance Time (such plans, the " **Old Plans** "),
other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time under the
corresponding Old Plan; (ii) with respect to each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any
Continuing Employee, (A) all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or
limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents and
(B) any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be recognized under the New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan; and

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) the crediting of the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to
any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the
account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but
unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time,
will not be subject to forfeiture (except to the extent such forfeitures
applied under the Company Benefit Plans in effect as of to the date of this
Agreement).

 



 

(e) _No Third Person Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this Section 7.10 nor any
provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans will be deemed
to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject
to Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries otherwise satisfying
its obligations under this Section 7.10, require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company
Benefit Plan or other benefit plan or arrangement or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be treated as
establishment, an amendment of, or undertaking to establish or amend, any
Company Benefit Plan or other benefit plan or arrangement.

 



 

7.11 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the
Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the
failure by either of them to perform and discharge any of their respective
covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
IX and (2) Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Offer set forth in Sections (4), (5), (6) or (7) of _Exhibit B_ to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Offer or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 7.12(a).

 



 

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and
(2) Effective Time, Parent will give

 



      
 

 



 

prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any representation or
warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or
failure would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger. No such notification will affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the
Company to consummate the Offer and the Merger or the remedies available to
the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided to the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.12(b).

 



 

7.13 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall each issue a press release
concerning this Agreement and the Merger that is reasonably acceptable to the
other Party. Thereafter, subject to Section 6.3 and Section 6.4, the Company
(other than with respect to the portion of any communication relating to a
Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media
interviews; (b) engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional
investors or other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are
public or are reasonably likely to become public, in each case to the extent
relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, except that the Company
will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to
communications (i) that are required by applicable Law; (ii) that are
principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors
so long as such communications are consistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or
individually if approved by the other Party); or (iii) to the extent related
to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change.

 



 

7.14 _Transaction Litigation_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and
(2) Effective Time, the Company will provide Parent with prompt notice of all
Transaction Litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with
respect thereto) and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof. The Company will (a) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation; (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement
and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (c) consider in good faith
Parents advice with respect to any Transaction Litigation. The Company may
not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any Transaction
Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this
Section 7.14, "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise
affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect to such
Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making power or
other authority over such Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or
compromise consent set forth above.

 



      
 

 



 

7.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to
applicable Law to cause (a) the delisting of the Company Common Stock from
Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; and (b) the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 



 

7.16 _Additional Agreements_. If at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each
Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

 



 

7.17 _Credit Agreement_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
provide (or cause to be provided) to the Company funds in an amount equal to
the amount necessary for the Company to repay and discharge in full all
amounts outstanding under the terms of the Credit Agreement. Promptly
following the Effective Time, the Company will repay and discharge such
indebtedness in a manner acceptable to the parties to the Credit Agreement and
Parent.

 



 

7.18 _Parent Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
execute and deliver to Merger Sub (with a copy also sent to the Company) a
written consent adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

7.19 _Conduct of Business by Parent and Merger Sub_. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX and (2) Acceptance Time, unless the Company otherwise
consents, Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will not direct any of their
Affiliates (including Sponsor) to:

 



 

(a) acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, any business
of any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets if such business competes in any line
of business of the Company or its Subsidiaries and the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition,
merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay
in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger; (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any
such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger; or

 



 

(b) enter or agree to enter into any definitive agreement for the acquisition
of any business or Person or take or agree to take any other action that, in
either case, would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with their
ability to make available to the Payment Agent

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Acceptance Time funds sufficient for the satisfaction
of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger, that, in each case,
prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger.

the valid right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e); or
(ii) any Party whose action or failure to act (which action or failure to act

Date; or (B) the expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Offer without Merger Sub having accepted for

(e) by Parent if (i) the Company has breached or failed to perform in any
material respect its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
such that the condition to the Offer set forth in Section (7) of _Exhibit B_

representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement have
become inaccurate in any material respect such that the conditions to the
Offer set forth in Sections (4), (5) or (6) of _Exhibit B_ would not be
satisfied as of the date of such inaccuracy, except that, in the case of each
of clauses (i) and (ii), if such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy is
capable of being cured by the Termination Date, Parent will not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) prior to the delivery
by Parent to the Company of written notice of such breach, failure to perform
or inaccuracy, delivered at least 45 days prior to such termination, stating
Parents intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e)
and the basis for such termination, it being understood that Parent will not
be entitled to terminate this Agreement if such breach, failure to perform or
inaccuracy has been cured prior to termination (to the extent capable of being
cured);

 



 

(f) by Parent if, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board (or a

9.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1 (other than pursuant to Section 9.1(a)) must deliver prompt
written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail
the provision of Section 9.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being
terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such
termination.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual written agreement
of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating
Party to the other Parties. Following the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect
without liability of any Party to the other Parties, as applicable, except
that, and subject in all respects to this Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section
10.8 (in each case, including the limitations set forth herein or therein),
Section 7.4(c), Section 7.4(f), Section 7.13, this Section 9.2, Section 9.3,
Section 9.4, Section 9.5 and Article X will each survive the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence but subject to Section 9.3(e), nothing in this Agreement
will relieve any Party from any liability for any willful and material breach
of this Agreement. No valid termination of this Agreement will affect the
rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement
or the Equity Commitment Letter, which rights, obligations and agreements will
survive the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms.

 



 

9.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 9.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger will be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Offer
and the Merger are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the
Payment Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Company Payments_.

 



 

(i) _Future Transactions_. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1(c), Section 9.1(d) or Section 9.1(e); (B) at the time
of such termination, the conditions set forth in Section (1) and Section (3)
of _Exhibit B_ have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and, in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(e), the Company does not
have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g); (C)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c), Section 9.1(d) or
Section 9.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within
one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c),
Section 9.1(d) or Section 9.1(e), as applicable, either an Acquisition
Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such
Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then the Company will,
concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or
cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to $4,100,000 (the
" **Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of this
Section 9.3(b)(i), all references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(ii) _Company Board Recommendation Change_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(f), then the Company must within two
Business Days following such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or
its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(iii) _Superior Proposal_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1(h), then the Company must concurrently with such termination pay
or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Parent; provided, that if such termination occurs prior to the
expiration of the Transaction Solicitation Period, then "Termination Fee" in
this Section 9.3(b)(iii) shall mean an amount equal to $2,800,000.

 



 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
will the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and
upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting
from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation; and (iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Therefore, the Termination Fee, if, as and when required
to be paid pursuant to this Section 9.3, will not constitute a penalty but
rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

(d) _Payments; Default_. If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 9.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a Legal

 



      
 

 



 

Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in Section 9.3(b) or any portion thereof, then the Company will pay or
cause to be paid to Parent the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) of Parent
in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of 4.5% plus the prime rate (as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment
or portion thereof was required to be made) through the date that such payment
or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Certain Limitations_.

 



 

(i) _Parent Liability Limitation._ Other than for (x) financial obligations
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter that
may be specifically enforced in accordance with Section 10.8 and (y) willful
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or the Equity Commitment
Letter by Sponsor, under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages
payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches of this
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed in the aggregate for all such
breaches an amount equal to $16,300,000 plus the Reimbursement Obligations
(the " **Parent Liability Limitation** ") (it being understood that (1)
"willful breach" for purposes of this sentence means a material breach that is
the consequence of an act or omission with the actual knowledge or intention
that the taking of such act or omission would, or would be reasonably likely
to, constitute a material breach of this Agreement or the Equity Commitment
Letter, and (2) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
the Equity Commitment Letter, in order for the exception in the foregoing
clause (y) to be permitted with respect to a claim of monetary damages in
respect to any willful breach, the Company has first sought and was
unsuccessful in obtaining a specific performance remedy to address such claim
of willful breach (such clauses (1) and (2), collectively the " **Willful
Breach Requirements** ")). In no event will any of the Company Related Parties
seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or any other
Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be
entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the
Parent Liability Limitation against (A) Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsor; or
(B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing Sources,
Affiliates (other than Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsor), members, managers,
general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Sponsor (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively,
the " **Parent Related Parties** "), and in no event will the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any
kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in
excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties
for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by the
Sponsor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure
to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable law arising
out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other than the Sponsors
obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement,
in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the
Sponsor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the
Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Merger; provided that nothing in this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.3 shall be deemed to limit the Companys rights as a third party
beneficiary to specific performance of the Equity Commitment Letter in
accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(ii) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Parents receipt of the Termination Fee to
the extent owed pursuant to Section 9.3(b) and Parents right to specific
performance pursuant to Section 10.8 will be the sole and exclusive remedies
of Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates against (A)
the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (B)
the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (the
Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the " **Company Related Parties**
") in respect of this Agreement and the Merger, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further monetary
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Merger (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates)
will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parties may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 9.2, Section
9.3(a) and Section 9.3(d), as applicable).

 



 

(f) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 9.3(e), it is agreed that
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 10.8(b), except
that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may, subject to the
Willful Breach Requirements, determine its choice of remedies hereunder,
including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to
the limitations of, Section 10.8(b), under no circumstances will the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type
contemplated by Section 10.8(b) and any monetary damages.

 



 

(g) _Non-Recourse Parent Party_. Except for claims that the Company may assert
(i) against any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement or (ii) against Parent or Merger
Sub to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Sponsor to
the extent expressly provided for in the Equity Commitment Letter, in no event
will the Company seek or obtain, nor will it permit any of its Representatives
to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any
monetary recovery or monetary award against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as
defined in the Equity Commitment Letter, which excludes, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Sponsor, Parent and Merger Sub) with respect to this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter, the Offer, the Merger, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including any breach by the Sponsor, Parent or Merger
Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable
Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

 



 

(h) _Non-Recourse Company Party_. Except for claims that Parent or Merger Sub
may assert (i) against the Company to the extent expressly provided for in
this Agreement or (ii) against any Person that is party to, and solely
pursuant to the terms and conditions of, the Tender and Support Agreements, in
no event will Parent or Merger Sub or any Parent Related Parties seek or
obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives to seek or obtain,
nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
monetary award against any Company Related

 



      
 

 



 

Parties (other than the Company) with respect to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

 



 

9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and
Company Options pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment

Agreement.

 



 

10.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Vector Capital Management, L.P. and the Company have previously executed
the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning

including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Equity Commitment Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties

and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to

Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b)
survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and
effect until the earlier to occur of the (i) Effective Time and (ii) date on
which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is
validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



 

10.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 7.9 and this
Section 10.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies under this Agreement, except (a) as
set forth in or contemplated by Section 7.9; (b) if Sponsor, Parent or Merger
Sub wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches this Agreement, then,
following the termination of this Agreement, the Company, may seek damages and
other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options (which
Sponsor, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree may include damages based
on a decrease in share value or lost premium) subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 9.3(e); (c) from and after the Acceptance Time, the rights of
Company Stockholders who have validly tendered and not withdrawn their shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer to receive the Per Share Price
set forth in Article II; and (d) from and after the Effective Time, the rights
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards
and Company Options to receive the merger consideration set forth in Article
III. The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of the second sentence

 



      
 

 



 

of this Section 10.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options
by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such
holders, and it is understood and agreed that any and all interests in such
claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock-
Based Awards or Company Options and subsequently transfer therewith and,
consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received
by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by the
Company in connection therewith and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.3(e)) may, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (A)
distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any
date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use and
benefit of the Company in any manner that the Company deems fit. The
provisions of Section 7.4(a), Section 9.4, Section 10.10(b), Section 10.11 and
this Section 10.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and their
successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that Section 7.4(a),
Section 9.4, Section 10.10(b), Section 10.11 and this Section 10.6 will be
enforceable by the Financing Sources and their respective successors and
assigns).

 



 

10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

10.8 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by
applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may,
subject to the Willful Breach Requirements, pursue both a grant of specific
performance and monetary damages, under no circumstances will the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that
results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary damages (including any
monetary damages in lieu of specific performance).

 



 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(i) _Irreparable Damage_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of
it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Offer or the Merger) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms

 



      
 

 



 

and provisions of this Agreement (including specific performance or other
equitable relief to cause Parent to perform any obligations of Parent
hereunder to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter); (B) the
provisions of Section 9.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for
the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be
construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of each of the Offer and the
Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) _No Objections_. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand
(including specific performance or other equitable relief to cause Parent to
perform any obligations of Parent hereunder to enforce its rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter); and (B) the specific performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the
Parties pursuant to this Agreement (including specific performance or other
equitable relief to cause Parent to perform any obligations of Parent
hereunder to enforce its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter). Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
other security.

 



 

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside
or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal
Proceeding relating to the Offer or the Merger, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 10.2 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this
Section 10.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the
event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Offer
or the Merger; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen
Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger will be brought, tried and determined only
in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that
such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal
Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger in any court
other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties acknowledges and
irrevocably agrees (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources
arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each
Party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such
Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to
bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at
their respective addresses provided in any applicable debt commitment letter
will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of them
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any
such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

10.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OFFER, THE MERGER, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT
LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING OR AGAINST THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER;
(b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.11.

 



 

10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic

 



      
 

 



 

mail (any such delivery, an " **Electronic Delivery** "), will be treated in
all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an
Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each
Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

10.13 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants
and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative;
(b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing
set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent
expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or
effect of any other provision of this Agreement.

 **TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT**

 



 

This **TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT** (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July
17, 2017, is by and among Sizmek Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Fuel Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and each of the Persons set forth on _Schedule A_
hereto (each, a " _Stockholder_ ").

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, each Stockholder (i) is the record or
beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of the
number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (" _Company
Common Stock_ "), of Rocket Fuel Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), set forth opposite such Stockholders name on _Schedule A_ (all such
shares set forth on _Schedule A_ , together with any shares of Company Common
Stock that are hereafter issued to or otherwise acquired or owned by any
Stockholder prior to the termination of this Agreement being referred to
herein as the " _Subject Shares_ ") and (ii) directly or indirectly owns the
number of Company Options set forth opposite such Stockholders name on
_Schedule A_ ;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof and as it may be
amended from time to time (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") that provides, among
other things, for Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer for all of the
issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company (the " _Offer_ ") and the
merger of the Company and Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement (capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have required that each Stockholder, and as
an inducement and in consideration therefor, each Stockholder (in such
Stockholders capacity as a holder of the Subject Shares and, if applicable,
Company Options) has agreed to, enter into this Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 

 **AGREEMENT TO TENDER**

 



 

1.1 **_Agreement to Tender_**. Each Stockholder agrees to validly tender or
cause to be tendered in the Offer all of such Stockholders Subject Shares
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer, free and clear of
all Encumbrances (as defined below) (other than Permitted Encumbrances (as
defined below)). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as promptly
as practicable after, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after,
the commencement of the Offer, each Stockholder shall (i) deliver pursuant to
the terms of the Offer (A) a letter of transmittal with respect to such
Stockholders Subject Shares complying with the terms of the Offer, (B) a
Certificate representing such Subject Shares or an "agents message" (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent

      
 

 



 

may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry share of any
uncertificated Subject Shares, and (C) all other documents or instruments
required to be delivered by the Company Stockholders pursuant to the terms of
the Offer, or (ii) instruct such Stockholders broker or such other Person
that is the holder of record of any Subject Shares beneficially owned by such
Stockholder to tender such Subject Shares pursuant to and in accordance with
clause (i) of this _Section 1.1_ and the terms of the Offer. Each Stockholder
agrees that, once such Stockholders Subject Shares are tendered, such
Stockholder will not withdraw any of such Subject Shares from the Offer,
unless and until the earliest of (i) the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (ii) this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, or (iii)
such date and time as any amendment or change to the Offer or Merger Agreement
is effected without such Stockholders consent that (A) decreases the
consideration payable for each share of Company Common Stock tendered in the
Offer, (B) materially and adversely affects such Stockholder or (C) violates
Section 2.1(b) of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDERS**

 



 

Each Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as to such
Stockholder, severally but not jointly, that:

 



 

2.1. ** _Organization; Authorization; Binding Agreement_**. If such
Stockholder is an entity, such Stockholder is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or constituted (to the extent such concepts are recognized in
such jurisdiction) and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby are within such Stockholders corporate or organizational powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or organizational actions
on the part of such Stockholder. Such Stockholder has full power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholder, and constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of such Stockholder enforceable against
such Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Applicable Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a Legal
Proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

2.2. ** _Non-Contravention_**. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by such Stockholder does not, and the performance by such Stockholder of such
Stockholders obligations hereunder and the consummation by such Stockholder
of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) violate any Law
applicable to such Stockholder or such Stockholders Subject Shares or, if
applicable, Company Options, (ii) except as may be required by applicable
securities law, require any consent, approval, order, authorization or other
action by, or filing with or notice to, any Person (including any Governmental
Authority) under, constitute a default (with or without the giving of notice
or the lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on any of the Subject Shares
or, if applicable, Company Options pursuant to any Contract, agreement, trust,
commitment, order, judgment, writ, stipulation, settlement, award, decree or
other instrument binding on such Stockholder or any applicable Law, or (iii)
if such Stockholder is an entity, violate any provision of such Stockholders
organizational documents.

 



      
 

 



 

2.3. ** _Ownership of Subject Shares, Company Options; Total Shares_**.
Such Stockholder is the record or beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act) of such Stockholders Subject Shares and, if
applicable, Company Options and has good and marketable title to such Subject
Shares and, if applicable, Company Options free and clear of any Liens,
claims, proxies, voting trusts or agreements, options, rights, understandings
or arrangements or any other encumbrances or restrictions whatsoever on title,
transfer or exercise of any rights of a stockholder in respect of such Subject
Shares and, if applicable, Company Options (collectively, " _Encumbrances_ "),
except as provided hereunder or pursuant to any applicable restrictions on
transfer under the Securities Act (collectively, " _Permitted Encumbrances_
"). The Subject Shares and Company Options listed on _Schedule A_ opposite
such Stockholders name constitute all of the Company Securities beneficially
owned by such Stockholder as of the date hereof, and such Stockholder neither
holds nor has any beneficial ownership in any other Company Securities. Except
pursuant to this Agreement, no Person has any contractual or other right or
obligation to purchase or otherwise acquire any of such Stockholders Subject
Shares or, if applicable, Company Options.

 



 

2.4. ** _Voting Power_**. Other than as provided in this Agreement, such
Stockholder has full voting power with respect to such Stockholders Subject
Shares and full power of disposition, full power to issue instructions with
respect to the matters set forth herein and full power to agree to all of the
matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to all of such
Stockholders Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company Options. None of such
Stockholders Subject Shares are subject to any proxy, voting trust or other
agreement or arrangement with respect to the voting of such Subject Shares,
except as provided hereunder.

 



 

2.5. ** _Reliance_**. Such Stockholder has had the opportunity to review
the Merger Agreement and this Agreement with counsel of such Stockholders own
choosing. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent and Merger
Sub are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Stockholders
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

 



 

2.6 **_Absence of Litigation_**. With respect to such Stockholder, as of the
date hereof, there is no Legal Proceeding pending against, or, to the
knowledge of such Stockholder, threatened in writing against such Stockholder
or any of such Stockholders properties or assets (including the Subject
Shares and, if applicable, Company Options) that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation by such Stockholder

Each Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees, severally but not jointly, that
until the termination of this Agreement:

 



 

4.1. ** _Voting of Subject Shares_**.

 



 

(a) At every meeting of the Company Stockholders called during the Voting
Period, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof during the Voting
Period, such Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any
applicable record date to, appear or otherwise cause such Stockholders
Subject Shares to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum
at any such meeting of Company Stockholders and vote such Stockholders
Subject Shares (to the extent that any of the Subject Shares are not purchased
in the Offer) (the " _Vote Shares_ ") (i) in favor of (A) the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
and (B) approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to a later
date, if there are not sufficient votes for the adoption and approval of the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby or such other
transaction on the date on which such meeting is held, (ii) against (A) any
Acquisition Proposal or (B) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement
that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Merger
Agreement by the Company or result in a breach of any covenant, representation
or warranty or any

 



      
 

 



 

other obligation or agreement of such Stockholder under this Agreement and/or
(iii) in favor of any other matter expressly contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, which is considered at any such meeting of the Company
Stockholders. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Voting Period_ " shall
mean the period commencing on the date hereof and ending immediately prior to
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.2_ hereof.

 



 

4.2. ** _No Transfer; No Inconsistent Arrangements_**. Except as provided
hereunder (including pursuant to _Section 1.1_ or _Section 4.1_) or under
the Merger Agreement, such Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (i)
create or permit to exist any Encumbrance, other than Permitted Encumbrances,
on any or all of such Stockholders Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company
Options, (ii) transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge, pledge or otherwise dispose
(whether by sale, liquidation, dissolution, dividend or distribution) of, or
enter into any derivative arrangement with respect to (collectively, "
_Transfer_ "), any or all of such Stockholders Company Securities, including
any Subject Shares and Company Options, or any right or interest therein (or
consent to any of the foregoing), (iii) enter into any contract, option or
other agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any Transfer of
any or all of such Stockholders Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company
Options, or any right or interest therein, (iv) grant or permit the grant of
any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization or consent in or with
respect to any or all of such Stockholders Subject Shares and, if applicable,
Company Options, (v) deposit or permit the deposit of any or all of such
Stockholders Company Securities, including any Subject Shares, into a voting
trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any of
such Company Securities, including the Subject Shares, or (vi) take or permit
any other action that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the
performance of such Stockholders obligations hereunder or the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise make any representation or warranty of such
Stockholder herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect. Any action
taken in violation of the foregoing sentence shall be null and void _ab
initio_ and such Stockholder agrees that any such prohibited action may and
should be enjoined. If any involuntary Transfer of any or all of such
Stockholders Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company Options shall occur
(including, if applicable, a sale by such Stockholders trustee in any
bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any creditors or court sale), the
transferee (which term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees
and subsequent transferees of the initial transferee) shall take and hold such
Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company Options subject to all of the
restrictions, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect until valid termination of this Agreement.
Such Stockholder agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates not to, become a member of a "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any Company Securities for the
purpose of opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such Stockholder may make Transfers of Subject Shares and, if
applicable, Company Options (a) to any "Permitted Transferee" (as defined
below), in which case the Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company Options
shall continue to be bound by this Agreement and provided that any such
Permitted Transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions
of this Agreement prior to the consummation of any such Transfer; (b) with
respect to any Company Options which expire on or prior to the expiration of
the Offer, to the Company for purpose of a net exercise permitted under the
documents related to such Company Options (pursuant to which any Common Stock
issued by the Company would be Subject Shares); or (c) as Parent may otherwise
agree in writing in its sole discretion. If so requested by Parent, such
Stockholder agrees that the Subject Shares and, if applicable, Company Options
shall bear a legend stating that the respective Subject Shares, Company
Options are subject to this Agreement, provided such legend shall be removed
upon

 



      
 

 



 

the valid termination of this Agreement. A " _Permitted Transferee_ " means,
with respect to any Stockholder, (i) a spouse, lineal descendant or
antecedent, brother or sister, adopted child or grandchild, or the spouse of
any child, adopted child, grandchild, or adopted grandchild of such
Stockholder, (ii) any charitable organization described in Section 170(c) of
the Code, (iii) any trust the beneficiaries of which include only the Persons
named in clause (i) or (ii) of this definition, or (iv) any corporation,
limited liability company, or partnership, the stockholders, members, and
general or limited partners of which include only the Persons named in clause
(i) or (ii) of this definition.

 



 

4.3. ** _No Exercise of Appraisal Rights; Actions_**. Such Stockholder (i)
waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights (including pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL) in respect of such Stockholders Subject Shares that
may arise with respect to the Offer and the Merger and (ii) agrees not to
commence or join in, and agrees to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or
otherwise, against Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
successors (x) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin the operation
of, any provision of this Agreement or (y) alleging breach of any fiduciary
duty of any Person in connection with the negotiation and entry into the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

4.4. ** _Documentation and Information_**. Such Stockholder shall not make
any public announcement regarding this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior written consent
of Parent. Such Stockholder consents to and hereby authorizes Parent and
Merger Sub to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with
the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document that Parent or
Merger Sub reasonably determines to be necessary in connection with the Offer,
the Merger and any transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, such
Stockholders identity and ownership of the Subject Shares and/or, if
applicable, Company Options, the existence of this Agreement and the nature of
such Stockholders commitments and obligations under this Agreement, and such
Stockholder acknowledges that Parent and Merger Sub may in Parents sole
discretion, file this Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority. Such Stockholder agrees to promptly give Parent any
information it may reasonably require for the preparation of any such
disclosure documents, and such Stockholder agrees to promptly notify Parent of
any required corrections with respect to any written information supplied by
it specifically for use in any such disclosure document, if and to the extent
that such Stockholder shall become aware that any such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect.

 



 

4.5. **_No Solicitation_**. From and after the expiration of the Transaction
Solicitation Period, such Stockholder shall not, nor shall such Stockholder
authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement
of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal that
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective designees) any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective designees), in any such case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate
or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate,
or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third

 



      
 

 



 

Persons relating to the making of an Acquisition Proposal (other than only
informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this _Section 4.5_);
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; or (vi) authorize, resolve or commit
to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit any Stockholder from taking any action that the
Company or its Representatives are permitted to take under Sections 6.3 and
6.4 of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

4.6 **_Adjustments_**. In the event (a) of any stock split, stock dividend,
merger, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or the like of the capital stock of the Company on, of or
affecting the Subject Shares or (b) that such Stockholder shall become the
beneficial owner of any additional shares of Company Common Stock, then the
terms of this Agreement shall apply to the shares of Company Common Stock held
by such Stockholder immediately following the effectiveness of the events
described in clause (a) or such Stockholder becoming the beneficial owner
thereof as described in clause (b), as though, in either case, they were
Subject Shares hereunder. In the event that any such Stockholder shall become
the beneficial owner of any other securities entitling the holder thereof to
vote or give consent with respect to the matters set forth in _Section 4.1_
hereof, then the terms of _Section 4.1_ hereof shall apply to such other
securities as though they were Subject Shares hereunder.

Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any

counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have
no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether
by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). At
the request of any party, each other party shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or Contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or by email with facsimile or scan attachment as a defense
to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such
defense.

 



 

5.8. ** _Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this

of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 



 

5.10. ** _Specific Performance_**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties will be entitled, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the

 



       
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of
the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The parties agree not to raise any objections to (i) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Stockholders, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand;
and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in

waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

 



 

5.11 ** _Headings_**. The Section headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

5.12. ** _Mutual Drafting_**. Each party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties; accordingly, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

5.13. ** _Further Assurances_**. Parent, Merger Sub and each Stockholder
will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all further

things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

5.14. ** _Interpretation_**. Unless the context otherwise requires, as used
in this Agreement: (i) "or" is not exclusive; (ii) "including" and its
variants mean "including, without limitation" and its variants; (iii) words

incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Subject Shares. All rights,
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall
remain vested in and belong to each applicable Stockholder, and neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall have any authority to manage, direct, restrict, regulate,
govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or
exercise any power or authority to direct such Stockholder in the voting of
any of the Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.
