the terms of such voting agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger
Sub II and the Company intend that the Mergers, taken together, will be
treated as a single integrated transaction that will qualify as a

immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, including the right to receive,
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, into which such shares of Company Common Stock would
have been converted pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ (the "
_Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_.

 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the
Company or is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor
(collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

(iii) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be automatically
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
common share, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _The Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time by virtue of the Second
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share
of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist. Each limited
liability company interest of Merger Sub II issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a
limited liability company interest of the Surviving LLC; _provided_ that in
the event the Revised Structure Notice shall have been delivered by Parent in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, each share of Parent Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as a share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that are owned by
stockholders that have properly perfected their rights of appraisal within the
meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until
such stockholders shall have failed to perfect any available right of
appraisal under applicable Law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be
entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right of appraisal, the shares of Company Common Stock held by
such stockholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares for purposes of this
Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to 

 



-6- 

    

 have been converted into the Merger Consideration at the First Effective
Time in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_. The Company shall give Parent
(A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served or delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company and (B) the opportunity and right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood that, subject to
good-faith consultation with Parent, the Company will have the right to
direct and control any such negotiations and proceedings). The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment
with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any such
demand or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with the DGCL.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the First
Effective Time. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the First Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").
The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders
for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented
thereby. At or immediately after the First Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ in book-
entry form equal to the Stock Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration) and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_ and the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions under  _Section_ __ _
2.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.1_ _,_ the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.5_ and any dividends or other distributions under _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with
the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make,
and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with

 



-7- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f),_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not
expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events
be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations
fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in
commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Parent.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Company Common Stock Certificates_. Promptly after the First Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate and whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an
indemnity bond) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into
which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article_ __ _ II_, including any Fractional Share Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.5_, and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_ for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid

 



-8- 

    

 any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of any Book-Entry Shares and whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered
holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the First
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the First
Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the
First Effective Time) the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_, including any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and any amounts that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_, for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share, and
the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith cancelled. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) or in
respect of any Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the First Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this _Article_ __ _ II_. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the First Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled
to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that
have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to
the Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable
Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and any dividends
or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_)
or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon.

 



-9- 

    

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub I,
the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger
Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent, an indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, including any amount
payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_.

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case, until the surrender of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent,
an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the First Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the First Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 2.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, each Company Option (whether vested or
unvested) held by any individual who is not an employee of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall, in
each case, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Option becoming
entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Share covered
by such Company Option, less applicable Tax withholdings.

 

(b) At the First Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than a
Company Option covered by _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_) shall, without any action
on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, cease to represent a
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed and
converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Option

 



-10- 

    

 immediately prior to the First Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Option/RSU
Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole
share. Each Adjusted Option shall have an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock equal to (i) the per share exercise price for shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to
the First Effective Time _divided by_  (ii) the Option/RSU Conversion Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Adjusted Option shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding
Company Option under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms.

(c) At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU and each Company Restricted
Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time
and that is held by a non-employee director of the Company will vest as of the
First Effective Time and shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company
RSU or Company Restricted Share Award becoming entitled to receive, in full
satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU or Company Restricted Share Award immediately prior to the First
Effective Time.

 

(d) At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU (other than any Company RSU
covered by _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_) that is outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted automatically into a
restricted stock unit with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ ") equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company RSU immediately prior to the First Effective Time  _by_ (ii)
the Option/RSU Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to
the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU
under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, including vesting terms.

(e) At the First Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share Award (other
than any Company Restricted Share Award covered by _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_)
that is outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall,
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof,
be assumed and converted automatically into an award covering a number of
shares of restricted Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted
Share Award_ ") equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted
Share Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time _by_ (ii) the
Restricted Stock Conversion Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded down to
the nearest whole share (provided that the holder of the relevant Company
Restricted Share Award shall be entitled to cash in an amount equal to such
fractional share _multiplied by_ the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the
nearest whole cent). The per share repurchase price of each such Adjusted
Restricted Share Award shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)
the per share repurchase price applicable to the Company Restricted
Share Award _by_ (ii) the Restricted Stock Conversion Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest cent. Each Adjusted Restricted Share Award shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding
Company Restricted Share Award under the applicable Company Equity Plan and
the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms.

 



-11- 

    

(f) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide
that: (i) with respect to any offering periods in effect as of the date hereof
(the " _Current ESPP Offering Periods_ "), no employee who is not a
participant in a Current ESPP Offering Period as of the date hereof may
become a participant in the Current ESPP Offering Period, and no participant
may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election
from that in effect on the date hereof for such Current ESPP Offering
Periods; (ii) subject to the consummation of the Mergers, the Company ESPP
shall terminate effective immediately prior to the First Effective Time; (iii)
if the Current ESPP Offering Periods terminate prior to the Effective Time,
then the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be
commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement;
and (iv) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the First
Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period shall
be accelerated to a date that is three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(g) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall pass such resolutions
and take such other actions as are necessary so as to cause the treatment of
the Company Equity Awards and the Company ESPP as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3._

(h) Parent shall file with the SEC, at or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the First Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), to the extent such form is available, relating to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Adjusted Options, Adjusted
Restricted Share Awards and Adjusted RSUs. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or statements for so long as Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted
Share Awards and Adjusted RSUs remain outstanding.

Section 2.4.  _Withholding_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub I, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with
respect to such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local
or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 

Section 2.5. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ the Parent Trading Price,
rounded to the nearest whole cent.

 



-12- 

    

Section 2.6. _Tax Treatment_.

 

(a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II
and the Company intend that the Mergers, taken together, will be treated as a
single integrated transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted
as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of determining the
value of Parent Common Stock to be received by Company Stockholders pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Revenue Procedure
2018-12, 2018-6 IRB 349 (" _Rev. Proc.  2018-12_"), (i) the "Safe Harbor
Valuation Method" within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 2018-12 will be the Average
of the Daily Volume Weighted Average Prices as described in Section 4.01(1)
of Rev. Proc. 2018-12; (ii) the "Measuring Period" within the meaning of
Section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 2018-12 will be the five (5) consecutive trading
days ending on November 24, 2020; (iii) the "national securities exchange"
within the meaning of Section 3.01(4)(a)(ii) of Rev. Proc. 2018-12 will be
the NYSE; and (iv) the "authoritative reporting source" within the meaning of
Section 3.01(4)(a)(ii) of Rev. Proc. 2018-12 will be Bloomberg Finance L.P.
The Parties further agree that the valuation of Parent Common Stock by
reference to the methodology described in this Section 2.6(b) is intended to
qualify for the "Safe Harbor Valuation Method" within the meaning of Section
4.01(1) of Rev. Proc. 2018-12 and no Party shall take any position for Tax
purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the extent otherwise required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code.

Section 2.7. _Alternative Transaction Structure_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company and the trustee under
the Convertible Notes Indenture have not each executed a supplemental
indenture to the Convertible Notes Indenture in accordance with the terms
thereof amending the terms thereof to permit the consummation of the Second
Merger at the Second Effective Time without giving rise to a breach of, or any
default under, any provision of the Convertible Notes Indenture, then Parent
may irrevocably elect the Alternative Transaction Structure (as defined
below) (by written notice to the Company at least one (1) Business Day prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, a " _Revised Structure Notice_ "; _provided_
 that if the Closing does not occur on the anticipated Closing Date, Parent
may revoke such Revised Structure Notice and, at a later date, irrevocably
elect to deliver a new written notice at least one (1) Business Day prior to
the actual Closing Date), and upon delivery of such Revised Structure Notice,
the structure of the Second Merger shall be modified such that for all
purposes hereunder the Second Merger shall consist of the Surviving
Corporation merging with and into Parent, with the separate existence of the
Surviving Corporation ceasing and Parent continuing as the surviving
corporation in the Second Merger (the " _Alternative Transaction Structure_
"). If the Alternative Transaction Structure is adopted in accordance with
the preceding sentence, (i) all references to "Merger Sub II" or "Surviving
LLC" herein shall be deemed deleted from this Agreement (or replaced with
"Parent," solely to the extent the context requires such replacement to give
effect to the Alternative Transaction Structure), and any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Merger Sub II or the Surviving LLC, as
applicable, under this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and
there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II
or the Surviving LLC for any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of Merger Sub II under this Agreement and (ii) all other provisions
of this Agreement shall be given effect and shall continue in full force and
effect and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall (subject to the terms and conditions hereof) occur.

Section 2.8. _Limitation on Cash Consideration Payable_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Threshold Percentage
(determined without regard to this sentence) is less than 41%, then an amount
of cash otherwise payable to the holders of Company Common Stock under this
Agreement (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares), equal to the amount
of cash that would be necessary to cause the recomputed Threshold Percentage
to equal 41%, shall instead be payable to such holders in an equivalent amount
of Parent Common Stock (with each Parent Common Stock valued for this purpose
at the Parent Trading Price); _provided_ that cash shall be payable in respect
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.5_. This  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (including the defined terms used herein) is
intended to cause this Agreement to satisfy the requirements of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(e) (treating not less than 41% as a "substantial
part" solely for such purpose) and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
therewith.

Affiliates has, at any time during the preceding six (6) years, contributed

will, except as required by the terms of this Agreement, (i) result in any

result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) that would, individually or

a material fact or omitted (or with respect to Parent SEC Documents filed
after the date hereof, will omit) to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, at the time and in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Since
February 1, 2019, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received from
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity any written comments or questions
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents (including the financial
statements included therein) that are not resolved, or, as of the date hereof,
has received any written notice from the SEC or other Governmental Entity that
such Parent SEC Documents (including the financial statements included

is not, as of the date hereof, any investigation or review being conducted by
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity of any Parent SEC Documents
(including the financial statements included therein).

schedules) of Parent included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC
Documents when filed or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date

Parents principal executive officer and principal financial officer pursuant
to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each
such certification, such certification complied in all material respects with

maintains, and at all times since January 31, 2017 has maintained, disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such
terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act,
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parents disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 31, 2017, Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents board of directors (the
material circumstances of which (if any) and significant facts learned during
the preparation of such disclosure have been made available to the Company
prior to the date hereof) (a) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting, (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting and (c) any written claim or allegation
regarding clause _(a)_ or _(b)_. Since January 31, 2017, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has received any material, unresolved complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
their respective internal accounting controls.

Subsidiary has any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent, absolute or otherwise, except (a) as and to the extent
specifically disclosed, reflected or reserved against in Parents consolidated
balance sheet (or the notes thereto) as of January 31, 2020 included in the
Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date hereof, (b) for
liabilities incurred or which have been discharged or paid in full, in each
case, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since
January 31, 2020 (other than any liability for any material breaches of
Contracts), (c) as expressly required or expressly contemplated by this
Agreement and (d) for liabilities which have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

(including Environmental Laws and employee benefits and labor Laws) applicable

pursuant to any applicable Law necessary for Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry
on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent Permits_
"), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as has not had and would

Parent Material Adverse Effect, all Parent Permits are in full force and
effect, no default (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) has
occurred under any such Parent Permit and none of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw or modify any such Parent Permit.

-47-

on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II.

Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.2(d)_, Parent will have at the Closing access to all of the funds that
are necessary for it to pay the Cash Consideration and consummate the
Transactions, and to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Parent
Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration pursuant to the terms hereof,

(other than restrictions under applicable securities laws, or restrictions
created by any Company Stockholder) will be free of restrictions on transfer.

Company Stockholders to consider a proposal that would reasonably be expected

_(ix)_ (to the extent related to the foregoing _clauses_ _ (iii)_, _(iv)_ ,
_(v)_ , _(vi)_ , _(vii)_ or _(viii)_ ), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").
The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officer and directors to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and the Company Subsidiaries other Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any persons (or provision of any information to any persons)
with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the
date hereof (and in any event within two (2) Business Days following the date
hereof), the Company shall (A) request in writing that each person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal
promptly destroy or return to the Company all nonpublic information
heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such
person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality agreement and (B) terminate access to any physical or
electronic data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal by such
person and its Representatives. The Company shall enforce, and not waive,
terminate or modify without Parents prior written consent, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality,
standstill or other agreement; _provided_ that, if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular
standstill provision would be reasonably likely to violate the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, with prior written
notice to Parent, waive such standstill solely to the extent necessary to
permit the applicable person (if it has not been solicited in violation of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company
Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such person
agreeing to disclosure of such 

 



-56- 

    

 Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in each case as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the term "
_person_ " means any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or any of their Representatives. Notwithstanding the limitations
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, if the Company receives, prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval being obtained, a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives may
contact the Person or any of its Representatives who has made such Acquisition
Proposal solely to clarify (and not to negotiate or engage in any discussions
regarding or relating to) the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal so that the Company may inform itself about such
Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by (x) a Company
Subsidiary, (y) a director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or (z) any other Representatives acting on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ by the
Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, if
the Company receives, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval being
obtained, an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, which the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal and, in each case, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then in either event the Company may take the following actions: (x)
furnish nonpublic information with respect to the Company to the person making
such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, if, and only if, prior to
so furnishing such information, the Company receives from such person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and the Company also provides
Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information
is provided or made available to such person, any nonpublic
information furnished to such other person that was not previously furnished
to Parent, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent of the Companys or any of its controlled affiliates or
its or their respective Representatives receipt of any Acquisition Proposal,
any proposals or inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information
relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any person who has made
or would reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice
shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request, and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal
or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry
or request, including unredacted copies of all written requests,
proposals, correspondence or offers, including proposed agreements received
by the Company or its Representatives relating to such Acquisition Proposal
or, if such Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a reasonably detailed
written description of the material terms and conditions thereof. Without
limiting the Companys other obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of
the status and material terms (including any amendments or proposed
amendments to such material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed on a

 



-57- 

    

 prompt and timely basis as to the nature of any information requested of the
Company with respect thereto and promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) provide to Parent copies of all proposals, offers and proposed
agreements relating to an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or its
Representatives or, if such information or communication is not in writing, a
reasonably detailed written description of the material contents thereof.
Without limiting the Companys other obligations under this _Section_ __ _
5.3_, the Company shall promptly provide (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the
Company provided to any other person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after such determination) inform Parent in writing if the Company
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any
person other than Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II from the restrictions
on "business combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or in
the Company Governing Documents, or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply. The Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter
into any agreement with any person which directly or indirectly prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ to the contrary, but
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Company
Stockholder Approval being obtained, the Company Board of Directors may (i)
make a Change of Recommendation (only of the type contemplated by  _Section_
__ _ 5.3(a)(iv)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)(vi)_) in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii)
make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ in
order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal received after the date of this Agreement (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_
and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn) if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company Board of Directors
has determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any
Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. " _Intervening Event_ "
means any Effect that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole) and was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the
Company or the Company Board of Directors as of or prior to the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the following events, changes
or developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt, existence or
terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or communications relating
thereto or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (B) changes in
the market price or trading volume of the Class A Common Stock, the

 



-58- 

    

 Parent Common Stock or any other securities of the Company, Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries, or any change in credit rating or the fact that the
Company meets or exceeds (or that Parent fails to meet or exceed) internal or
published estimates, projections, forecasts or predictions for any period, (C)
changes in general economic, political or financial conditions or markets
(including changes in interest rates, exchange rates, stock, bond and/or debt
prices), (D) changes in GAAP, other applicable accounting rules or applicable
Law or, in any such case, changes in the interpretation thereof or (E) natural
disasters, epidemics or pandemics (including the existence and impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic).

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4)-Business Days
prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors
intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable
detail, the reasons therefor, and during such four (4) Business Day period
(which period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the fourth (4th)
Business Day), the Company shall cause its Representatives (including its
executive officers) to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Change
of Recommendation and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (which
period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the fourth (4th) Business
Day) the Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(i)_ (after in good faith taking into account any
amendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(ii)_, the
Company shall provide Parent with four (4) Business Days prior written
notice advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take
such action and specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed definitive
documentation, and during such four (4) Business Day period (which period
shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day),
the Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers)
to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal
and at the end of such four (4) Business Day period (which period shall
expire at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day) the
Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)(ii)_ (after in good faith taking into account the amendments proposed
by Parent). With respect to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any
material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior
Proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration
the Company Stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal),
the Company shall notify Parent of each such amendment, revision or change in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ and the applicable four (4) Business
Day period shall be extended until at least three (3) Business Days after the
time that Parent receives notification from the Company of each such revision,
and the Company Board of Directors shall not take any such action permitted
under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(ii)_ prior to the end of any such period (which
period shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on the applicable day) as so
extended in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated

 



-59- 

    

 under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any legally required disclosure to
the Company Stockholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, which
actions, in the case of _clauses (i)_ - _(iii)_ , shall not constitute or be
deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation so long as any such disclosure
(x) includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation,
without any amendment, withdrawal, alteration, modification or qualification
thereof and (y) does not include any statement that constitutes, and does not
otherwise constitute, a Change of Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ shall not permit the Company Board of Directors
to make (or otherwise modify the definition of) a Change of Recommendation
except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_.

Section 5.4. _Preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus;_ _Company Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company (with Parents reasonable cooperation) shall use
reasonable best efforts to prepare within thirty (30) days following the
execution of this Agreement a mutually acceptable Proxy Statement/Prospectus
(as part of the Registration Statement), and Parent (with the Companys
reasonable cooperation) shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file
within thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement with the SEC
the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First Merger.
Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A)
cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply
with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B) have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments
from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement,
take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the First Merger and (C) keep the Registration Statement
effective through the Closing in order to permit the consummation of the First
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may
be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. As promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement shall have become effective, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be filed and mailed to
its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the Company,
in each case without providing the other Party with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable
Party in good faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; _provided_ that,
without limiting the generality of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, with respect to
documents filed by a Party which are incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right to review
and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other
Party or such other Partys business, financial condition or results of
operations. If, at any time prior to the First Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration
Statement or the Proxy

 



-60- 

    

 Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, at the time and in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and,
following a reasonable opportunity for the other Party to review and comment
on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.
Subject to applicable Law, each Party shall notify the other promptly of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective, of the issuance of
any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the First Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other with
copies of all correspondence between either Party or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or
the Mergers.

(b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company shall (i) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing of the Registration Statement with the SEC and in
consultation with Parent, conduct a "broker search" in accordance with Rule
14a-13 of the Exchange Act for a record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (ii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval (as it may be adjourned or postponed as provided below, the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days following the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement), and the Company shall submit
such proposal to the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting
and shall not submit any other proposal to the Company Stockholders in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting (other than an advisory vote
regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal regarding
adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting) without the prior written
consent of Parent. The Company agrees (i) to provide Parent with reasonably
detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely
basis (including, if requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the
last seven (7) days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting) and to give
written notice (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be given via email) to
Parent one (1) day prior to, and on the date of, the Company Stockholders
Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date, sufficient proxies representing
the Requisite Company Vote have been obtained.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting without
Parents prior written consent; _provided_ that without Parents prior written
consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
(i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration
Statement required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the Company
within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by
proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,

 



-61- 

    

 to allow reasonable additional time for solicitation of proxies for purposes
of obtaining a quorum or the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that
unless agreed to in writing by Parent, (x) any such adjournment or
postponement shall be for a period of no more than ten (10) Business Days, and
(y) the Company shall only be permitted to effect no more than one (1) such
adjournment or postponement pursuant to this  _clause (ii)_ ; _provided_ that
(A) no postponement contemplated by this _clause (ii)_ shall be permitted if
it would require a change to the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting, and (B) if requested by Parent, the Company shall effect an
adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting under the
circumstances contemplated by this _clause (ii)_ for a period of up to ten
(10) Business Days each ( _provided_ that Parent shall only make up to one
(1) such request, and no such request for a postponement shall be permitted if
it would require a change in the record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) solicit
from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Transactions, including the Merger and (B) take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder
Approval, including, unless the Company Board of Directors has validly made a
Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, by
communicating to the Companys stockholders the Company Board Recommendation
and including such Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the Company Stockholders for approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such
obligation and (y) all other obligations of the Parties hereunder shall
continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the First Effective Time or the

shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and
Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
offices, properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records (so long as any
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the Companys business), and
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to, furnish as promptly as practicable to Parent all information (financial or
otherwise) concerning its business, properties, offices, Contracts
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (including information for
purposes of transition and integration planning). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ to
provide Parent or Parents Representatives with access to or to disclose
information (i) that is prohibited from being disclosed pursuant to the terms
of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the
date hereof or after the date hereof in the

 



-62- 

    

 ordinary course of business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, at Parents written request, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (x) to obtain the required consent of such
third party to such access or disclosure or (y) to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in violation of
such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which, in the reasonable
good-faith judgment of the Company, would violate applicable Law ( _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure
not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the disclosure of which, in the
reasonable good-faith judgment of the Company, would cause the loss of any
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that such access
or disclosure would not jeopardize attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege).

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, in confidence to the extent required by
and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company (solely with respect to the matters set
forth in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ and subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_) (i)
of any notice or other communication received by such Party from any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Voting Agreement,
the Transactions, including the Mergers, or the transactions contemplated by
the Voting Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, (ii) of
any legal proceeding commenced or, to such Partys Knowledge, threatened
against such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors
or officers or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors or officers, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Mergers or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, and
(iii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any Company Subsidiary that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.1(c)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter prior to the date hereof or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger
Sub II; _provided_ , _further_ , that either Partys obligations, actions or
inactions pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, in each case in and of
themselves, shall be deemed excluded for purposes of determining whether the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, as
applicable, has been satisfied.

Section 6.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including the Mergers, as soon
as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing
or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other Party and as promptly
as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to

taking all actions as may be necessary, subject to the limitations in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, to obtain (and cooperating with each other in
obtaining) all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each Party agrees to (x) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed

requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable and (y) make all other necessary
or advisable filings as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary materials that may be requested under
any Regulatory Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company may not and may
not permit any Subsidiary to, without the prior written consent of Parent,
become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (A) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, Parent,
Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing, (B)
conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, the
business or portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any Subsidiary
of any of the foregoing in any manner or (C) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any Subsidiary of
any of the foregoing, in the case of each of _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_
, if any such action would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, (x) materially reduce the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) impact Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries in a manner or amount that is
material relative to the value of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; _provided_ that if requested by Parent, the Company or its
Subsidiaries will become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Company or its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing occurs.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with and without
limiting the efforts referenced in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ to obtain all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations for the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, (i) to the extent
not prohibited by applicable Law, cooperate in all respects and consult with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions and reasonably considering in good faith comments of the other
Party and furnish the other Party with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to
any such Governmental Entity, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by
promptly providing copies to the other Party of any such written
communications (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other Party
of such communications), and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ,
the FTC or other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person
meetings, substantive telephone calls or conferences with the DOJ, the FTC or
other Governmental Entity or other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials required to be provided pursuant to the foregoing _clauses_ _ (i)_-
_(iii)_ may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of
Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_ _ that each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel
Only Material" which such material and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Parent on the one hand or the Company on the other)
or its legal counsel.

 

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, in the event that
Parent requests the Company to do so, the Company shall give any notices to
third parties required under Contracts, and the Company shall use, and cause
each of the Company Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain
any third party consents to any Contracts that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Transactions, including the Mergers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consent
or other similar fee, payment or consideration, make any other concession or
provide any additional security (including a guaranty), to obtain such third
party consents (except, in the case of the Company, if requested by Parent and
either (i) reimbursed or indemnified for by Parent or (ii) subject to the
occurrence of the Closing).

Section 6.3. _Publicity_. From and after the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, neither the Company nor Parent,
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or cause the publication
of any press release or other public announcement or disclosure with respect
to the Mergers, the other Transactions or this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such
Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is
required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of such press release or other public announcement or
disclosure with respect to the Mergers, the other Transactions or this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor,
on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement or disclosure in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Parties shall not be required
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to provide any such review or opportunity to
comment to the other Party relating to any dispute between the Parties
relating to this Agreement; (ii) each Party may make statements that are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section_ __
_ 6.3_ or make statements regarding the actual or expected financial impact
(including earnings guidance) of the Transactions on such Party; and (iii) the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall not apply to any
communication regarding an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 5.3(f)_ or a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3.

 

Section 6.4. _D andO Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses prior to the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents; _provided_ that such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court
of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, nonappealable judgment that
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding
in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Mergers or any of the other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the First Effective Time, in connection with such
Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or of any other Person if such service was
at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents or the organizational documents of the applicable Company Subsidiary
(as applicable) or any

 



-66- 

    

 indemnification agreements with such Persons in existence on the date of
this Agreement as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.
The Parties agree that all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification
and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the First Effective Time, now existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any indemnification agreement of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of
this Agreement as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement
shall survive the Transactions, including the Merger, and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ that,
for the avoidance of doubt, such indemnification agreements shall survive the
Closing only with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) and shall not apply to any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred after the First Effective
Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified
Party notifies the Surviving Company on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the First Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such
Person intends in good faith to seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of
all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 

(b) For six (6) years after the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents
and (ii) any indemnification agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent
that such agreement provides for an earlier termination, in each case,
regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and
employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date
hereof, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the First Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers or any of the other Transactions).

 

(c) At or prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising at or prior to the First Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not commit or spend on such
"tail" policy, in the aggregate, more than three hundred percent (300%) of
the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof
for the Companys current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if
the cost of such "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the
Company shall be permitted to purchase only as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for the Base Amount. The Company shall in good faith cooperate
with Parent prior to the Closing with respect to the procurement of such
"tail" policy, including with respect to the selection of the broker,
available policy price and coverage options.

 



-67- 

    

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving LLC or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving LLC, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_. The rights and obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 6.4_ shall survive consummation of the Mergers and shall not be terminated
or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the
written consent of such Indemnified Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_, each of whom may enforce the provisions thereof.

 

Section 6.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Voting Agreement) and
(b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Mergers and the other
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Voting Agreement) may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Statute on the Mergers and the other Transactions. No Change of Recommendation
shall change, or be deemed to change, or permit the Company or the Company
Board of Directors to change, in any manner or respect, the approval of the
Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be
inapplicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Voting Agreement).

 

Section 6.6. _Obligations of Merger Subs_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including the
Mergers, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the obligations of
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II under this Agreement shall also be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by Parent.

Section 6.7. _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof
or as subsequently amended or terminated as permitted pursuant to the terms of
such Company Benefit Plans and this Agreement. Effective as of the First
Effective Time and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent
shall provide to each employee of the Company and Company Subsidiary who
continues to be employed by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "), (i) substantially comparable aggregate on
target earnings (for clarity, consisting of base pay or wage rate, as
applicable, and incentive cash compensation opportunity, but excluding equity
incentive compensation) to those in effect for such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing; provided that, for each Continuing Employee
whose compensation does not include commissions, such Continuing Employee
shall also be provided at least the same wage rate or

 



-68- 

    

 base salary as those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) employee benefits (including health and welfare
benefits, but excluding equity incentive compensation, retirement benefits
and cash bonus opportunities) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to
such Continuing Employee than, (A) for the period from the First Effective
Time through December 31, 2021, those in effect for such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, and (B) for the period from January 1, 2022
through the first anniversary of the First Effective Time, those in effect for
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (iii)
retirement benefits that are, in the aggregate, in Parents discretion, either
(A) no less favorable to such Continuing Employee than those in effect for
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (B) no less
favorable than those in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the
First Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall,
subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the First Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
First Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the First Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time (other than any
administrative delays in connection with any transition to Parents tax
qualified defined contribution plan), in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the First
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent or its applicable
Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
preexisting condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
First Effective Time and (B) Parent and its applicable Subsidiary shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) If, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the First Effective Time,
Parent provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to
terminate its 401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k)
plans effective as of the day immediately preceding the day on which the First
Effective Time occurs (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide

 



-69- 

    

 Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant
to resolution of the Companys Board of Directors at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the day on which the First Effective Time occurs; _provided_
that, prior to amending or terminating the Companys 401(k) plan, the Company
shall provide Parent with the form and substance of any applicable resolutions
or amendments for review and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company 401(k) plan is
terminated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(c)_, then as soon as
practicable following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all
Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k)
plan immediately prior to the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in
Parents 401(k) plan and shall permit each such Continuing Employee to elect
to transfer his or her account balance when distributed from the terminated
Company 401(k) plan, including any outstanding participant loans, to Parents
401(k) plan, except to the extent accepting such transfers would adversely
affect the tax-qualified status of Parents 401(k) plan or as may be
prohibited by Parents 401(k) plan.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly
provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Company or any
affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or
other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment
or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or (ii) create any third party rights in
any current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate all
Contracts, arrangements or relationships between the Company or any Company

Parties intend this Agreement to meet the requirements of measuring continuity
of interest pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(2)(i). The

statement or its exhibits) and signed by an officer of the Company (the "
_Company Tax Representation Letter_ "); _provided_  that, in each case, the
representation letter shall contain such customary representations, warranties
and covenants as are reasonably necessary or appropriate to allow each of
Parents Counsel and Companys Counsel to provide the opinions of counsel
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_.

Section 6.14.  _Financing Cooperation_ (a) . Prior to the First Effective

efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, provide
customary cooperation and customary financial information, in each case that
is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any financing (the "

financing the Transactions or any transaction undertaken in connection
therewith (it being understood that the receipt of any such financing is not a
condition to the Mergers), including by (i) furnishing, or causing to be
furnished, to Parent (x) audited consolidated balance sheets and related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders
equity and cash flows for the Company for each of the three most recently
completed fiscal years of the Company ended at least ninety (90) days prior

consistent with that of the most recent fiscal year and (y) unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows (in each
case, subject to normal year-end adjustments and absence of footnotes) for
each subsequent fiscal quarter ended on a date that is at least forty-five
(45) days before the Closing Date, and (ii) using reasonable best efforts to
cause the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries independent accountants, as
requested by Parent, to consent to the use of their audit reports on the
financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in any
materials relating to the Financing or in connection with any filings made
with the SEC or pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act in connection
with the Financing and to provide any "comfort letters" (including drafts
thereof which such accountants are prepared to issue at the time of pricing
and at closing of any offering or placement of the Financing) necessary and
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any debt capital markets
transaction comprising a part of the Financing and to participate in customary
due diligence sessions; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no such cooperation
shall be required to the extent it would (i) unreasonably disrupt the conduct
of the Companys business, (ii) require the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to incur any fees, expenses or other liability prior to the
First Effective Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed or simultaneously
indemnified, (iii) be reasonably expected to cause any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any
material personal liability, (iv) require the Company to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or (v) require the Company to provide any information
that is prohibited or restricted by applicable Law or is legally privileged (
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of Law or to allow for such access or
disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of such legal
privilege); and (B) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall

 



-72- 

    

 not be required to execute any credit or security documentation or any other
definitive agreement (other than customary authorization letters) or provide
any indemnity, in each case of this  _clause (B)_ , prior to the First
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Companys
breach of any obligations in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_ be considered in
determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b)
unless (i) the Company shall not have attempted in good faith to comply with
such obligation in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14(a)_ and (ii) such breach is
the primary cause of Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing at the First Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except in the
event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from (i)the willful
misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, (ii) the material
breach by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement or (iii) any
material misstatement or omission in information provided in writing hereunder
by or on behalf of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives for use in connection with the Financing (
_clauses (i)_ through (iii) collectively, the " _Indemnity Exceptions_ "). If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _ Article_ __ _ VIII_, Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
actually incurred by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including those
of its Representatives) in connection with taking action required
or requested by Parent pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 6.14_, other than
those arising out of or resulting from the Indemnity Exceptions. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ represent the sole obligation of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective affiliates and
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing and no other provision of this Agreement (including the
Exhibits and the Company Disclosure Letter) shall be deemed to expand or
modify such obligations.

 

Section 6.15. _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to) deliver

the First Effective Time the termination of all commitments outstanding under

outstanding thereunder, the release of all Liens securing such obligations,
and the release of all guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to, (A) use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent
at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a draft payoff
letter and draft related release documentation and (B) deliver to Parent at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an executed payoff
letter and executed related release documentation, in each case, with respect
to the Company Credit Agreement (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and
substance customary for transactions of this type, from the agent on behalf of
the Persons to whom such Indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letter together
with any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount and provide that all guarantees and Liens granted in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries securing such Indebtedness and any other obligations
secured thereby, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the Payoff
Letter at or prior to the First Effective Time, be released and terminated.

 



-73- 

    

(b) Within the time periods required by the terms of the Convertible Notes
Indenture, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
take all actions required by, or reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to,
the Convertible Notes Indenture and applicable Law to be performed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary at or prior to the Second Effective Time as
a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions, including the giving of any notices that may be required
or reasonably requested by Parent and delivery to the trustee, holders or
other applicable Person, as applicable, of any documents or instruments
required or reasonably requested by Parent to be delivered at or prior to the

in each case in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Transactions or as otherwise required by, or reasonably requested by
Parent pursuant to, the Convertible Notes Indenture; _provided_ that the
Company (or the applicable Company Subsidiary) shall deliver a copy of any
such notice or other document to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
to delivering or entering into such notice or other document in accordance
with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, prior to the Second Effective Time, the Company
agrees to cooperate with Parent, at Parents written request, by (i) executing
and delivering (or causing to be executed and delivered, as applicable) at
the First Effective Time and/or Second Effective Time, as applicable, one or
more supplemental indentures, officers certificates and opinions of counsel,
in each case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, pursuant
to the Convertible Notes Indenture and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts
to cause the trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture to execute at the
First Effective Time and/or Second Effective Time, as applicable, any such
supplemental indenture.

(c) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall (i) facilitate the
settlement of the Convertible Note Hedge Obligations substantially
concurrently with the First Effective Time as reasonably requested by Parent
(it being understood that any such settlement, including the timing thereof,

otherwise agreed by the relevant dealer thereunder) and (ii) cooperate with
Parent with respect to its efforts to settle the Convertible Note Hedge
Obligations and the negotiation of any termination or settlement payment or
valuation related thereto; _provided_ that the Company shall not (x) exercise
any right that it may have to terminate the Convertible Note Hedge Obligations
(other than any exercise or termination contemplated pursuant to Section
9(h)(i) of the Capped Call Confirmations upon any conversion of Convertible
Notes prior to the First Effective Time (a " _Specified Exercise_ ")); it
being agreed that the Company shall notify Parent in writing as promptly as
practicable prior to any such exercise or termination) or (y) agree to amend,
modify or supplement the terms relating to, or agree to any amount due upon,
the termination or settlement thereof, in each case of _clauses (x)_ and
_(y)_ , without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.15(c)_ shall require the Company to (A)
pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment
in connection with any Convertible Note Hedge Obligations prior to the
occurrence of the First Effective Time, (B) enter into or effect any
settlement, termination, instrument or agreement, or agree to any settlement,

agreement, that is effective prior to the occurrence of the First Effective
Time or (C) refrain from delivering, or 

 



-74- 

    

 delay the delivery of, any notice required by the terms of the Convertible
Note Hedge Obligations or a notice contemplated by Section 9(h)(i) of the
Capped Call Confirmations in connection with a Specified Exercise (it being
understood that the Company will provide Parent with prior notice of any such
delivery with an opportunity to comment on the relevant notice).

 

(d) Parent and/or one of its Subsidiaries may (i) commence one or more offers
to purchase any or all of the outstanding Convertible Notes for cash, Parent
Common Stock or a combination thereof (the " _Offers to Purchase_ "); and/or
(ii) solicit the consent of the holders of Convertible Notes regarding certain
proposed amendments to the Convertible Notes Indenture (the " _Consent
Solicitations_ " and, together with any Offers to Purchase, the " _Company
Note Offers and Consent Solicitations_ "); _provided_ that the closing of any
such Offer to Purchase shall not be consummated prior to the First Effective
Time and any such transaction shall be funded using consideration provided by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries). Any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be
made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and
conditionality) as are proposed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries and which
are permitted by the terms of such Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes
Indenture and applicable Laws, including SEC rules and regulations. Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall consult with the Company regarding the material
terms and conditions of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations,
including the timing and commencement of any Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations and any tender deadlines. Parent shall not be permitted to
commence any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations until Parent shall
have provided to the Company the necessary offer to purchase, consent
solicitation statement, letter of transmittal, press release, if any, in
connection therewith, and each other document relevant to the transaction that
will be distributed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to holders of the
Convertible Notes in the applicable Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a reasonable
period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Company Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations to allow the Company and its counsel to review and
comment on such Debt Offer Documents (and Parent shall consider in good faith
comments of the Company and its counsel thereon). Subject to the receipt of
the requisite consents, in connection with any or all of the Consent
Solicitations, the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the
Convertible Notes Indenture in accordance with the terms thereof amending the
terms and provisions of such Convertible Notes Indenture as described in
the applicable Debt Offer Documents in a form as reasonably requested by
Parent, which supplemental indenture shall become effective promptly upon
receipt of the requisite consents (or as otherwise contemplated in the
applicable Consent Solicitation) but shall not become operative until the
First Effective Time. At Parents or its Subsidiaries expense, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, on a timely
basis, upon the reasonable request of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
provide cooperation in connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations (including but not limited to requesting, and using reasonable
best efforts to cause, the Companys independent accountants to provide
customary consents for use of their reports to the extent required in
connection with any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations); _provided_
that prior to the First Effective Time, neither the Company nor counsel for
the Company shall be required to furnish any certificates, legal opinions or
negative assurance letters in connection with any Company Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations (other than, in connection with the execution of the
supplemental indentures relating to the Consent Solicitations, the Company
delivering and using reasonable best efforts to cause counsel for the

 



-75- 

    

 Company to deliver customary officers certificates and customary legal
opinions (other than any opinions as to tax matters), respectively, to the
trustee under the Convertible Notes Indenture, to the extent such
certificates and opinions would not conflict with applicable Laws and would be
accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered) or
execute any other instruments or agreements in connection therewith other
than the supplemental indenture described in the immediately preceding
sentence. The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other agent retained in connection with any Company Note Offers
and Consent Solicitations will be selected by Parent or its Subsidiaries and
their fees and out-of-pocket expenses will be paid directly by Parent. The
consummation of any or all of the Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations shall not be a condition to Closing. If at any time prior to the
completion of the Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations, any
information should be discovered by the Company, Parent or one of their
respective Subsidiaries that any of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries reasonably believes should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Debt Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall
be disseminated by or on behalf of the Parent to the holders of the
applicable Convertible Notes (which supplement or amendment and dissemination
may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, if related to information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries take the form of a filing of a
Current Report on Form 8-K); _provided_ that Parent shall provide a copy of
such amendment or supplement to the Company a reasonable period of time in
advance of such dissemination to allow for Company and its counsel to review
and comment on such amendment or supplement (and Parent shall consider in good
faith and accept all reasonable comments of the Company and its counsel
thereon).

 

(e) As promptly as practical on or after the Free Trade Date (as defined in
the Convertible Notes Indenture) and in any event no later than the De-
Legending Deadline Date (as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture), the
Company shall remove the Restrictive Notes Legend (as defined in the
Convertible Notes Indenture), or cause to be deemed removed the Restrictive
Notes Legend, from the Convertible Notes, and cause such Convertible Notes to
be assigned an unrestricted CUSIP number as a result thereof, in each case, in
accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture.

 

Section 6.16. _Certain Actions_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take the actions set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

_clause (D)_ , where any failures of any such representations and warranties
to be true and correct (without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect contained therein) have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b)  _Performance of Obligations of Parent_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II shall have performed or complied in all material respects with
the obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed or complied
with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the Closing.

(c) _Parent Officer_ __ _s Certificate_. The Company shall have received a
certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, signed by the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer of Parent certifying that each of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_
has been satisfied.

(d) _Tax Opinion_. The Company shall have received a written opinion from
Companys Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of
facts, representations and assumptions, set forth or referred to in such
opinion, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Mergers, taken together,
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. In rendering the opinion described in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(d)_, Companys Counsel shall be entitled to rely on the Parent Tax
Representation Letter and the Company Tax Representation Letter and such other
information as Companys Counsel reasonably deems relevant.

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Mergers
and the other Transactions may be abandoned at any time before the Closing,
as follows (with any termination by Parent also being an effective termination
by Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by the Company, in the event that (i) Parent, Merger Sub I and/or Merger
Sub II shall have breached, failed to perform or violated their respective
covenants or agreements under this Agreement or (ii) any of the
representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II set
forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of
_clause_ __ _ (i)_ or _(ii)_ in a manner that would give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_ and such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is not
capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by
the Outside Date, is not cured by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, as
applicable, before the earlier of (x) the Business Day immediately prior to
the Outside Date and (y) the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following receipt
of written notice from the Company of such breach, failure to
perform, violation or inaccuracy; _provided_ that the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_
if the Company is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_;

(c) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company shall have breached, failed
to perform or violated its covenants or agreements under this Agreement or
(ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of _clause_ __ _
(i)_ or  _(ii)_ in a manner that would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ and such breach, failure to perform, violation or
inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable of
being cured by the Outside Date, is not cured by the Company before the
earlier of (x) the Business Day immediately prior to the Outside Date and (y)
the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following receipt of written notice from
Parent of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy; _provided_
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ if Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II is
then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_;

 



-80- 

    

(d) by either Parent or the Company if the Closing has not occurred on or
before August 1, 2021 (as extended, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that
(i) if, on the Outside Date, all of the conditions to Closing, other than the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_
(to the extent any such injunction or order is in respect of, or any such Law
is, the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law) and those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at Closing (but provided that such
conditions shall then be capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to
take place on such date), shall have been satisfied or waived, then the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended one (1) time for all
purposes hereunder for an additional three (3) months, which date shall
thereafter be deemed to be the Outside Date and (ii) on the Outside Date as so
extended pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_, all of
the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.1(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ (to the extent any such injunction or
order is in respect of, or any such Law is, the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Law) and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at Closing (but provided that such conditions shall then be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing were to take place on such date), shall have
been satisfied or waived, then the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended one (1) additional time for all purposes hereunder for an additional
three (3) months, which date shall thereafter be deemed to be the Outside
Date;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to any Party
whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been a proximate cause of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated
by the Outside Date and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement;

 

(e) by Parent, if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i)
the Company Board of Directors shall have effected a Change of Recommendation
(whether or not in compliance with this Agreement) or (ii) the Company has
materially breached _Section_ __ _ 5.3_;

 

(f) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,
decree or ruling in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions;

 

(g) by either the Company or Parent, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall
not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at the Company Stockholders
Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;
or

(h) by the Company in order to effect a Change of Recommendation and
substantially concurrently enter into a definitive agreement providing for a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (i) the Company has complied in all
material respects with the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and (ii)
substantially concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to) the
termination of this Agreement, the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the
other Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger
Sub II or the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ through _Section_ __ _ 9.12_
shall survive such termination;  _provided_ that __

 



-81- 

    

 nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or willful
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. For purposes of this
Agreement, (i) " _willful breach_ " shall mean an action or omission taken or
omitted to be taken that the breaching party intentionally takes (or fails to
take) and actually knows would, or would reasonably be expected to, be or
cause a material breach of this Agreement; and (ii) " _fraud_ " shall mean
common law fraud that is committed with actual knowledge of falsity and with
the intent to deceive or mislead another.

 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, or Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ as a result of a breach,
failure to perform or violation described in such Section that (except with
respect to a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_) first occurred following the
making of an Acquisition Proposal of the type referenced in the following
_clause (B)_ , (B) after the date hereof and prior to the date of such
termination (or prior to the Company Stockholder Approval in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_), a _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal is publicly disclosed (whether by the Company or a third party), or
otherwise made known to the Company Board of Directors or the Companys
management, and in each case, is not withdrawn (publicly, if
publicly disclosed) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the earlier of
the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the date of such termination
and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated or a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal is entered into, then on or prior to the date that is the earlier of
(x) the date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated and (y) the date of
entry in any such definitive agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee
of nine hundred million dollars ($900,000,000) in cash (the " _Termination
Fee_ "). Solely for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_, the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Annex
A, except that all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" and "eighty five
percent (85%)" therein shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)."

(ii) If (x) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1(e)_ or (y) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1(d)_ at a time when Parent would be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, within two (2) Business Days
after such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(h)_, substantially concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to)
such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

(iv) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding _clauses_ __ _ (i)_, _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , such amount shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent (which account shall be designated by Parent upon request
by the Company to allow the Company to pay or cause to be paid to Parent any
amounts payable hereunder within the time periods required by this _Section_
__ _ 8.2_). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



-82- 

    

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party
further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent, Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 8.2(b)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including disbursements and fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amounts, including in
connection with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii)
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the amounts payable pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ from and including the date payment of such amounts
were due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set
forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except the right to seek monetary damages for fraud (solely as it
relates to the representations and warranties expressly made in _Article_ __ _
III_) or for willful breach occurring prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement, and without limiting Parents, Merger Sub Is or Merger Sub IIs
right to specific performance in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.12_, (A)
the Termination Fee (and any other amounts expressly contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, if any) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
available to Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions in any circumstance in which the Termination
Fee becomes due and payable and is paid by the Company in accordance with this
Agreement, and (B) upon Parents receipt of the full Termination Fee (and any
other amounts contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_) pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable,
none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
managers, members, affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
except for fraud or willful breach. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may
seek specific performance to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ and the payment of the Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_, but in no event shall Parent be
entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause the Company to consummate
the Transactions in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ and (ii) the
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_.

Section 9.5. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
sections, such reference shall be to a section of this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The word
"extent" and the phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other things extends, and such word or
phrase shall not merely mean "if." The term "or" is not exclusive, and shall
be interpreted as "and/or." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the
date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms of similar import, shall be
deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble to this Agreement. The
table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement or any schedule
delivered pursuant to this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes
only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or such schedule or any term or provision
hereof or thereof. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person,
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. A reference to
any specific Law or to any provision of any Law, whether or not followed by
the phrase "as amended," includes any amendment to, and any modification, re-
enactment or successor thereof, any legislative provision substituted
therefor and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued
thereunder or pursuant thereto, except that, for purposes of any
representations and warranties in this Agreement that are made as a specific
date, references to any specific Law will be deemed to refer to such
legislation or provision (and all rules, regulations and statutory instruments
issued thereunder or pursuant thereto) as of such date. The Parties agree that
they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

Section 9.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
other electronic transmission by the Parties, in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .pdf or
DocuSign format shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.7. _Entire Agreement; Third_ __ _ -Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II shall be permitted to take the actions
contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.13_,
nothing in this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter) or in the Confidentiality Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder.

Section 9.8. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Mergers is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Mergers are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of

 



-86- 

    

 any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding,
except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only
if) such court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts; and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such
courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.9(b)_ in the manner provided for notices
in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 9.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THE MERGERS OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.10_.

Section 9.11. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, but
without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.12. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



-87- 

    

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury, for which monetary damages
(even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers or the other
Transactions) is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Accordingly, it is agreed that each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, a decree or order
of specific performance specifically enforcing the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and any further equitable relief, in each case in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party entitled under the terms of this Agreement at law or in
equity.

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ are an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ (including any objection on the
basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the
avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at
Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks
any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_, such Party shall not be
required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

Section 9.13. _Financing_ _Entities_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company, on behalf of itself, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their controlled affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that
any Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Entities, arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, the Financing or any of the agreements (including any
applicable commitment letter) entered into in connection with the Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so
long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof
and each Party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect
to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees
that any such Proceeding shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts
of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another
state), except as otherwise provided in any applicable commitment
letter, agreement or document relating to the Financing, (c) agrees not to
bring or support or permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their affiliates to bring or support any Proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Entity in any way arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in
the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of
process upon the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their controlled
affiliates in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly,
intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law trial by jury in any Proceeding brought against the Financing
Entities in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the

 



-88- 

    

 Financing, any commitment letter relating thereto or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
(g) agrees that none of the Financing Entities will have any liability to the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their controlled affiliates or
Representatives (in each case, other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letter
