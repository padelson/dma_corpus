AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 26, 2001 (this " _Agreement_
"), among Tellabs, Inc ., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Omaha Merger
Corp., a Georgia corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(" _Sub_ "), and Future Networks, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "
_Company _ ") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter collectively referred to
as the " _Constituent Corporations _ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved and declared advisable the merger of Sub and the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, no par value, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), and each issued and outstanding
share of preferred stock, no par value, of the Company (" _Company Preferred
Stock_ "), not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, will be
converted into the right to receive the consideration provided for in Section
1.5 hereof;

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their
respective long-term business strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective stockholders;

 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently herewith the directors and certain stockholders of the Company
are entering into agreements with Parent dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Voting Agreements_ "), in the form of the attached _Exhibit A_ , pursuant to
which, among other things, each such stockholder has agreed to vote in favor
of this Agreement and the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement,
before the Closing, Parent, the Indemnity Agent (as hereinafter defined), and
the Stockholder Representatives (as hereinafter defined) shall enter into
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement (the " _Indemnity Agreement_ ") substantially
in the form of the attached  _Exhibit B_.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
   THE MERGER

  

   

 1.    _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the " _GBCC_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the GBCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the election of Parent, any direct wholly owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a Constituent Corporation in the Merger; _provided_ that such substituted corporation is a Georgia corporation. In such event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, in order to reflect such substitution. 
 

 2.    _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective when a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the GBCC, is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon mutual consent of the Constituent Corporations, the Certificate of Merger may provide for a later date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than 30 days after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. When used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger is accepted for recording or such later time established by the Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on the date of the Closing (as hereinafter defined).
 

 3.    _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 14-2-1106 of the GBCC.
 

 4.    _Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers._  
   

 1. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the Company (the " _Company Charter _ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended so that Article II reads in its entirety as follows: "The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock." As so amended, the Company Charter shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.
 

 2. The directors and officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.
  

 5.    _Conversion of Securities_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations: 
   

 1. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $.01 par value, of Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
 

 2. All shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock owned by Parent shall be canceled and no capital stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
 

 3. Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.6 and 1.7 hereof, each share of Company Common Stock and each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.5(b)) shall be converted into and become the right to receive the following (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in cash, without interest, in each case, when and to the extent payable as provided below:
   

 1. an amount equal to the Initial Cash Amount _divided by_ the number of Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Per Share Cash Payment_ "), to be paid as described in Section 1.6; plus
 

 2. the Per Share Holdback Payments (as defined in Section 1.5(f)(xviii)), if any; _plus
 _

 3. the Per Share Escrow Payments (as defined in Section 1.5(f)(xvii)), if any; _plus
 _

 4. the Per Share Option Holdback Payment (as defined in Section 1.5(f)(xix)), if any; 
  
 Such shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

 4. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have properly exercised dissenter\'s rights with respect thereto (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Sections 14-2-1321 and 14-2-1323 of the GBCC, shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to, and the Dissenting Shares shall only represent the right to receive, payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GBCC unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to demand payment under the GBCC. If, after  the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.5(d), if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholder\'s Dissenting Shares pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC shall cease. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for payment for shares of Dissenting Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
 

 5. In calculating the consideration payable under this Section 1.5, Parent shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.2 and the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(g). If such representations, warranties and certificate are not correct, Parent shall have the right to adjust the Merger Consideration accordingly such that the aggregate merger consideration payable by Parent, Sub or the Surviving Corporation to the holders of equity interests in the Company (including, without limitation, holders of options) in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed such consideration payable assuming such representations, warranties and certificate are correct.

At the time of delivery of any Claim Notice to the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by the Claiming Party to the Stockholder Representatives.
 

 2. Unless the Stockholder Representatives shall have delivered an Objection in accordance with Section 8.4(c), the Indemnity Agent shall, on the twentieth day (or such earlier day as the Stockholder Representatives shall authorize in writing to the Indemnity Agent) after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to indemnification for a specified amount, deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member named in the Claim Notice, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the specified amount.
 

 3. Until the twentieth day following delivery of a Claim Notice, the Stockholder Representatives may deliver to the Indemnity Agent a written objection (an " _Objection_ ") to the claim made in such Claim Notice. At the time of delivery of any Objection to the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy of such Objection shall be delivered to the Claiming Party.
 

 4. Upon receipt of an Objection properly made, the Indemnity Agent shall (i) deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member named in the Claim Notice, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to that portion of the amount subject to the Claim Notice, if any, which is not disputed by the Stockholder Representatives and (ii) designate and segregate out of the Indemnity Fund a portion thereof, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the amount subject to the Claim Notice which is disputed by the Stockholder Representatives. Thereafter, the Indemnity Agent shall not dispose of such segregated portion of the Indemnity Fund until the Indemnity Agent shall have received a certified copy of the final decision of the arbitrators as contemplated by Section 8.5, or the Indemnity Agent shall have received a copy of the written agreement between the Claiming Party and the Stockholder Representatives resolving such dispute and setting forth the amount, if any, which such Claiming Party is entitled to receive. The Indemnity Agent will deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member entitled to payment, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the amount that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive as set forth in the arbitration decision after the expiration of ten (10) business days from the receipt of such decision or, in the event that the amount to which the Claiming Party is entitled is established pursuant to an agreement between the Claiming Party and the Stockholder Representatives, promptly after the Indemnity Agent\'s receipt of such agreement.
  

 5.    _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.
   

 1. The Claiming Party shall deliver a written response to the Stockholder Representatives in respect of any Objection properly delivered by the Stockholder Representatives. If after twenty (20) days following delivery of such response there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Stockholder Representatives and the Claiming Party shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representatives and the Claiming Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both and shall be furnished to the Indemnity Agent. The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Parent Common Stock or other property from the Indemnity Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.
 

 2. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either the Claiming Party or the Stockholder Representatives may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss or Expense is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, Parent and the Stockholder Representatives shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in the related Claim Notice shall be binding, and conclusive, and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5, the Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Indemnity Fund in accordance therewith.
 

 3. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Chicago, Illinois under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys\' fees and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

The Persons designated to serve as the Stockholder Representatives may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Indemnity Fund from time to time upon not less than 10 days\' prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representatives, and the Stockholder Representatives shall receive no compensation for services. Any expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representatives in connection with their services hereunder shall be reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund upon presentation of appropriate expense documentation as and to the extent provided in Section 6 of the Indemnity Agreement.
 

 2. The Stockholder Representatives shall not be liable to the Company Stockholders for any act done or omitted hereunder or under the Indemnity Agreement as Stockholder Representatives while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the written advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company Stockholders shall severally indemnify the Stockholders Representatives and hold them harmless from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Representatives and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of their duties hereunder.
 

 3. The Stockholder Representatives shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially).
   

 7.    _Actions of the Stockholder Representatives_. A decision, act, waiver, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representatives shall constitute a decision of all Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Company Stockholder, and the Indemnity Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of any Stockholder Representatives as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Company Stockholder. The Indemnity Agent and each Parent Group Member are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement any action by one of the  then Stockholder Representatives shall be deemed to be the action of and binding upon all of the Stockholder Representatives.
 

 8.    _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Indemnity Fund, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representatives of such claim, and the Stockholder Representatives shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may not effect the settlement of any such claims without the consent of the Stockholder Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Stockholders Representatives have consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders Representatives shall have no power or authority to object under Section 8.4 or any other provision of this Article VIII to the amount paid in such settlement.

(e)The Stockholder agrees not to (i) other than by operation of law, sell,
transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract,

(a)The Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good title
to, the Subject Shares. The Stockholder does not own, of record or
beneficially, any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the
Subject Shares. The Stockholder has the sole right to vote, and the sole
power of disposition with respect to, the Subject Shares, and none of the

(b)This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the
Stockholder enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application which
may affect the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and by general
equitable principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Stockholder does not and will not conflict with any agreement, order or other
instrument binding upon the Stockholder, nor require the Stockholder to make
or obtain any regulatory filing or approval.

   

3. _Termination_. The obligations of the Stockholder hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 thereof or the Effective Time. No such termination shall relieve the Stockholder from any liability in connection with this Agreement incurred prior to such termination.

 

4. _Further Assurances_. The Stockholder will, from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents and other instruments as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of effectively carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5. _Successors, Assigns and Transferees Bound_. Any successor, assignee or transferee (including a successor, assignee or transferee as a result of the death of the Stockholder, such as an executor or heir) shall be bound by the terms hereof, and the Stockholder shall take any and all actions necessary to obtain the written confirmation from such successor, assignee or transferee that it is bound by the terms hereof.

 

6. _Remedies_. The Stockholder acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it, and that any such breach would cause Parent irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Parent, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.

 

7. _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction, or the validity or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. 

 

8. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written instrument executed and delivered by both the Stockholder and Parent.

 

9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

10. _Capitalized Terms_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not defined herein shall have such meanings as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 

11. _Counterparts_. For the convenience of the parties, this Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

12. _No limitation on Actions of the Stockholder as Director_. In the event the Stockholder is a director of the Company, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to require the Stockholder to take or in any way limit any action that the Stockholder may take to discharge the Stockholder\'s fiduciary duties as a director of the Company.

in writing by the Stockholder Representatives to the Indemnity Agent (with a

extent (i) the Indemnity Agent shall then have received written notice from
the Stockholder Representatives to such effect in accordance with Section 8(b)

Section 8(b)). Subject to Section 5(e), upon its receipt of a
Distribution Notice, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, shall

Stockholder for which such Subaccount was established.

 

b.Any amounts retained in escrow after the Distribution Date shall be held by

to such effect in accordance with Section 8(b) and shall not have already paid
the Stockholder Representatives therefor), and any remaining amounts shall be
distributed to the Exchange Agent (or, if the agreement appointing the
Exchange Agent shall then have terminated, to Parent), who shall disburse such
portion in the manner set forth in Section 5(a).

 

c.Upon distribution of any amount of the Indemnity Fund, the Indemnity Agent
shall give the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, notice (a
"Parent Notice") to such effect. Such notice shall be given to the following

Tellabs, Inc.

Exchange Agent, as directed, the portion of the Indemnity Fund specified in
such writing.

 

e.Within fifteen business days of receipt of a Parent Notice, Parent shall
provide written notice (the " _ Distribution Notice_ ") to the Exchange Agent
if the agreement appointing the Exchange Agent shall have not
then terminated, providing the portion or percentage of each Company
Stockholder\'s Subaccount, if any, that is attributable to Company Stock
Options (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that, as of such date, are still

Subaccount an amount (a " _Forfeiture Amount_ ") equal to the portion of such
Subaccount that is attributable to Forfeited Option Shares and credit to each
Company Stockholder\'s Subaccount an amount equal to the aggregate of all
Forfeiture Amounts _multiplied by_ such Company Stockholder\'s Stockholder
Percentage; _provided _ , _however_ , that for purposes of this Section 5(f)
each Company Stockholder\'s Stockholder Percentage shall be recalculated
after subtracting from the numerator the number of Forfeited Option Shares
held by such Company Stockholder and subtracting from the denominator the
total amount of Forfeited Option Shares for all Company Stockholders.

 

g.All additions to or subtractions from any subaccount, and all payments from
the Indemnity Fund pursuant to this Agreement, shall be rounded down to the
nearest cent.

 

Section 6. _Permitted Investments; Interest_.

this Indemnity Agreement, the Indemnity Agent is authorized and directed to
invest and reinvest the cash portion, if any, of the Indemnity Fund in any of
the following investments (each a " _Permitted Investment_ ") in each case
pursuant to joint instructions of the Parent and the Stockholder
Representatives: (i) readily marketable obligations maturing within six (6)
months after the date of acquisition thereof issued by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof; (ii) readily
marketable obligations maturing within six (6) months after the date of

Moody\'s Investors Service Inc.; (iii) readily marketable commercial
paper maturing within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of

pursuant to the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof
having combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. In the event
the Indemnity Agent does not receive joint instructions from Parent and the
Stockholder Representatives to invest or reinvest the cash portion of the
Indemnity Fund, the Indemnity Agent agrees to invest and reinvest such funds
in the Dreyfus Treasury Cash Management Fund, or a successor or similar fund
agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder Representatives in writing, which
invests in direct obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the United States Government and repurchase
agreements with respect to such securities. Permitted Investments and
interest accruing on, and any profit resulting from, such investments shall
be added to, and become a part of, the Indemnity Fund pursuant to this
Indemnity Agreement and shall be allocated among the Subaccounts of the
Company Stockholders based on the Permitted Investments credited to the
Subaccount of each. For purposes of this Indemnity Agreement, "interest" on
the Indemnity Fund shall include all proceeds thereof and investment earnings
with respect thereto. All Permitted Investments shall be registered in the
name of the Indemnity Agent. The Indemnity Agent shall have full power and
authority to sell any and all Permitted Investments held by it under
this Indemnity Agreement as necessary to make disbursements under this
Indemnity Agreement, and may use its Bond Department to effect such sales. The

Representatives shall not be responsible for any unrealized profit or
realized loss realized on such investments.

percent (50%) of any amount that Parent is required to pay to the Indemnity

Agent. With respect to any claims or actions against the Indemnity Agent
which are indemnified by Parent under this Section 7, Parent shall have the
right to retain sole control over the defense, settlement, investigation and
preparation related to such claims or actions; provided that (i) the

available to Parent and (ii) neither Parent nor the Indemnity Agent shall
settle or compromise any such claim or action without the consent of the
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

any letter, paper or other document furnished to it by any Parent Group Member
or the Stockholder Representatives, and believed by the Indemnity Agent to be
genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper party or parties.
In performing its obligations hereunder, the Indemnity Agent may consult with
counsel to the Indemnity Agent and shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be
protected in acting in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such counsel.

 

d.The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to the compensation set forth in
_Exhibit A_ hereto for the performance of services by the Indemnity Agent

(such fees, costs and expenses are hereinafter referred to as the " _Indemnity
Agent\'s Compensation_ "). The Indemnity Agent shall render statements to
Parent setting forth in detail the Indemnity Agent\'s Compensation and the
basis upon which the Indemnity Agent\'s Compensation was computed. The

paid from the Indemnity Fund after written notice from the Indemnity Agent to
Parent. Parent shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund

the Indemnity Agent pursuant to such reimbursement obligation, payable in the
manner set forth in Section 4 hereof.

 

e.The Indemnity Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) business
days written notice to Parent and the Stockholder Representatives; _provided_
that such resignation shall not be effective unless and until a
successor Indemnity Agent has been appointed and accepts such position
pursuant to the terms of this Section 7. In such event, Parent and the
Stockholder Representatives shall appoint a successor Indemnity Agent or, if

association or (ii) at the equal expense of Parent and the Stockholder
Representatives, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. Such appointment, whether by Parent
and the Stockholder Representatives, on the one hand, or the Indemnity Agent,
on the other hand, shall be effective on the effective date of the aforesaid
resignation (the " _Indemnity Transfer Date_ "). On the Indemnity Transfer
Date, all right title and interest to the Indemnity Fund, including interest
thereon, shall be transferred to the successor Indemnity Agent and this
Indemnity Agreement shall be assigned by the Indemnity Agent to such successor
Indemnity Agent, and thereafter, the resigning Indemnity Agent shall be
released from any further obligations hereunder. The Indemnity Agent shall be
paid any outstanding fees and expenses prior to transferring assets to a
successor indemnity agent. The Indemnity Agent shall continue to serve until
its successor is appointed, accepts the Indemnity Agreement and receives the
transferred Indemnity Fund.

 

f.The Indemnity Agent shall not have any right, claim or interest in any
portion of the Indemnity Fund except in its capacity as Indemnity Agent
hereunder.

 

g.It is understood and agreed that in the event any disagreement among Parent
and the Stockholder Representatives results in adverse claims or demands
being made in connection with the Indemnity Fund, or in the event the
Indemnity Agent in good faith is in doubt as to what action it should take
hereunder, the Indemnity Agent shall retain the Indemnity Fund until the
Indemnity Agent shall have received (i) an enforceable final order of a court
of competent jurisdiction which is not subject to further appeal directing
delivery of the Indemnity Fund or (ii) a written agreement executed by Parent
and the Stockholder Representatives directing delivery of the Indemnity Fund,
in which event Indemnity Agent shall disburse the Indemnity Fund in
accordance with such order or agreement. Any court order referred to in clause
(i) immediately above shall be accompanied by a legal opinion of counsel for
the presenting party satisfactory to the Indemnity Agent to the effect that
said court order or judgment is final and enforceable and is not subject to
further appeal. The Indemnity Agent shall act on such court order and legal
opinion without further question.

 

h.In no event shall the Indemnity Agent be liable in connection with this
Indemnity Agreement for any special, indirect or consequential loss or damage
of any kind whatsoever, even if the Indemnity Agent has been previously
advised of such loss or damage.

 

i.The Indemnity Agent shall provide Parent and the Stockholder Representatives
with such information and assistance as may be requested from time to time to
carry out any of the calculations contemplated hereby to be performed by
Parent.

 

Section 8. _Stockholder Representatives_.

Expenses_ "), which expenses shall be reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund (x)
promptly following receipt of such notice, until such reimbursements equal
$250,000 in total, and (y) thereafter in accordance with the provision of
Section 5(b) hereof.

 

c.Neither Parent, any Parent Group Member nor the Indemnity Agent shall be
responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of any Stockholder

shall constitute a decision of all Company Stockholders for whom amounts
otherwise payable to them are deposited in the Indemnity Fund and shall be

instruction of the Stockholder Representatives as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of each and every such Company Stockholder. The
Indemnity Agent and each Parent Group Member are hereby relieved from

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

     

 1. _Indemnity Fund_.
   

 1. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit 5.11% of the Purchase Price, rounded down to the nearest cent (the " _Initial Indemnity Amount_ ") with LaSalle Bank National Association (or another institution selected by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company) as indemnity and escrow agent (the " _Indemnity Agent_  "). Such deposit shall constitute the initial Indemnity Fund (as defined in the Indemnity Agreement) and shall be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Indemnity Agreement. Any Holdback Escrow Amount shall be added to the Indemnity Fund. The Indemnity Fund shall be available to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse any Parent Group Member from any Loss or Expense indemnifiable under this Article VIII and as provided in the Indemnity Agreement.
 

 2. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Company for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if this Agreement shall be terminated, provided that, subject to Section 1.5(f)(xviii)(6), resort to the Indemnity Fund shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parent Group Members for any such breaches and misrepresentations following the Effective Time other than for fraud.
 

 3. As used in this Agreement, (i) " _Expense_ " means any and all expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or asserting any claim, action, suit or proceeding incident to any matter indemnified against hereunder (including, without limitation, court filing fees, court costs, arbitration fees or costs, witness fees and reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel, investigators, expert witnesses, consultants, accountants and other professionals), (ii) " _Loss_ " means any and all losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, settlement payments, awards, judgments, fines, penalties, damages, expenses, deficiencies or other charges, and (iii) " _Parent Group Members_ " means Parent and its Affiliates and their respective successors and assigns, including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation.
  

 2. _Indemnification from Indemnity Fund_. 
   

 1. Subject to Section 8.1, from and after the Effective Time, each Parent Group Member shall be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund from and against any and all Loss and Expense incurred by such Parent Group Member in connection with or arising from:
   

 1. any breach or failure to perform by the Company of any of its agreements, covenants or obligations in this Agreement; or
 

 2. any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of the Company contained in Article III or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Article VI of this Agreement; 
  
  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnity Fund shall be used to indemnify
and hold harmless hereunder with respect to the matters set forth in clause
(ii) of this Section 8.2(a) (other than Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.9, 3.20,
3.28, the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(a) to the extent it
relates to such Sections, and the certificates delivered pursuant to Sections
6.3(g), 6.3(h) and 6.3(i), as to which this proviso shall not apply) only in
the event that the aggregate amount (without duplication) of Loss and Expense
borne by the Parent Group Members with respect thereto exceeds $150,000, at
which point this proviso shall no longer apply and the Parent Group Members
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to all such
aggregate amount of Loss and Expense and any Loss or Expense incurred or
suffered by them thereafter. Any payment pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be
made in the form of a transfer from the Indemnity Fund to the applicable
Parent Group Member(s) pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement.

  

 2. The Company acknowledges that Parent and the Company have agreed that Parent will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The Company further acknowledges that the information set forth in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(g) will be used as the basis for determining the Merger Consideration. In the event of any inaccuracy in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(g), Parent will be entitled (but not obligated) to recalculate the Merger Consideration and receive an amount from the Indemnity Fund such that the aggregate merger consideration paid by Parent, Sub or the Surviving Corporation to the holders of equity interests in the Company (including, without limitation, holders of options) in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed such consideration assuming information set forth in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(g) was true and correct in all respects at the Effective Time.
 

 3. The indemnification provided for in this Article VIII shall terminate on the first day following eighteen full months after the Effective Time (and no claims shall be made by any Parent Group Member under this Section 8.2 thereafter), except that such indemnification shall continue as to any Loss or Expense in connection with which a Claim Notice is given in accordance with the requirements of Section 8.4 on or prior to the date such indemnification obligation would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 8.2, as to which the indemnification obligation hereunder shall continue until the liability to be satisfied from the Indemnity Fund shall have been determined pursuant to this Article VIII, and all Parent Group Members shall have been reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund for such Loss or Expense in accordance with the terms hereof.
  

 3. _Termination of Indemnity Fund_. Upon termination of the indemnification obligations under this Article VIII and reimbursement of the Parent Group Members of Losses and Expenses payable in respect thereof hereunder, the Indemnity Fund shall terminate and shall be distributed in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement after payment of any amounts therefrom due to the Indemnity Agent.
 

 4. _Notice and Determination of Claims_.
   

 1. If any Parent Group Member wishes to make a claim for indemnification to be satisfied from the Indemnity Fund, such Parent Group Member (individually or collectively, the " _Claiming Party_ ") shall so notify the Indemnity Agent in writing (the " _Claim Notice_ ") of the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder. The Claim Notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Claiming Party attesting to the Claiming Party\'s contemporaneous delivery of a duplicate copy of the Claim Notice to the Stockholder Representatives (as hereinafter defined). Such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known) the Loss or Expense and the method of computation of such Loss or Expense and contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss or Expense shall have occurred. If the Claiming Party is not Parent, the Claim Notice must be accompanied by a certificate from Parent confirming that the Claiming Party is a Parent Group Member. At the time of delivery of any Claim Notice to the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by the Claiming Party to the Stockholder Representatives.
 

 2. Unless the Stockholder Representatives shall have delivered an Objection in accordance with Section 8.4(c), the Indemnity Agent shall, on the twentieth day (or such earlier day as the Stockholder Representatives shall authorize in writing to the Indemnity Agent) after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to indemnification for a specified amount, deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member named in the Claim Notice, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the specified amount.
 

 3. Until the twentieth day following delivery of a Claim Notice, the Stockholder Representatives may deliver to the Indemnity Agent a written objection (an " _Objection_ ") to the claim made in such Claim Notice. At the time of delivery of any Objection to the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy of such Objection shall be delivered to the Claiming Party.
 

 4. Upon receipt of an Objection properly made, the Indemnity Agent shall (i) deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member named in the Claim Notice, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to that portion of the amount subject to the Claim Notice, if any, which is not disputed by the Stockholder Representatives and (ii) designate and segregate out of the Indemnity Fund a portion thereof, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the amount subject to the Claim Notice which is disputed by the Stockholder Representatives. Thereafter, the Indemnity Agent shall not dispose of such segregated portion of the Indemnity Fund until the Indemnity Agent shall have received a certified copy of the final decision of the arbitrators as contemplated by Section 8.5, or the Indemnity Agent shall have received a copy of the written agreement between the Claiming Party and the Stockholder Representatives resolving such dispute and setting forth the amount, if any, which such Claiming Party is entitled to receive. The Indemnity Agent will deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member entitled to payment, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the amount that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive as set forth in the arbitration decision after the expiration of ten (10) business days from the receipt of such decision or, in the event that the amount to which the Claiming Party is entitled is established pursuant to an agreement between the Claiming Party and the Stockholder Representatives, promptly after the Indemnity Agent\'s receipt of such agreement.
  

 5. _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.
   

 1. The Claiming Party shall deliver a written response to the Stockholder Representatives in respect of any Objection properly delivered by the Stockholder Representatives. If after twenty (20) days following delivery of such response there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Stockholder Representatives and the Claiming Party shall attempt in good faith for sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representatives and the Claiming Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both and shall be furnished to the Indemnity Agent. The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the Parent Common Stock or other property from the Indemnity Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.
 

 2. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either the Claiming Party or the Stockholder Representatives may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss or Expense is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, Parent and the Stockholder Representatives shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in the related Claim Notice shall be binding, and conclusive, and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5, the Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Indemnity Fund in accordance therewith.
 

 3. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Chicago, Illinois under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys\' fees and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration.
  

 6. _Stockholder Representatives_. 
   

 1. The "Stockholder Representatives" shall be Andy Y.T. Chan and Michael Rand, who may be replaced by the Company prior to the Effective Time. Each of the Stockholder Representatives shall be constituted and appointed as exclusive agent for and on behalf of the Company Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent Group Members\' property from the Indemnity Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent Group Members, to object to such deliveries to object to Parent\'s determination as to whether any Per Share Holdback Payment is payable to the Company Stockholders or as to the amount thereof, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims\' determination, to incur expenses and retain counsel and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representatives for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Persons designated to serve as the Stockholder Representatives may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the Indemnity Fund from time to time upon not less than 10 days\' prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representatives, and the Stockholder Representatives shall receive no compensation for services. Any expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representatives in connection with their services hereunder shall be reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund upon presentation of appropriate expense documentation as and to the extent provided in Section 6 of the Indemnity Agreement.
 

 2. The Stockholder Representatives shall not be liable to the Company Stockholders for any act done or omitted hereunder or under the Indemnity Agreement as Stockholder Representatives while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the written advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company Stockholders shall severally indemnify the Stockholders Representatives and hold them harmless from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Representatives and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of their duties hereunder.
 

 3. The Stockholder Representatives shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially).
   

 7. _Actions of the Stockholder Representatives_. A decision, act, waiver, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representatives shall constitute a decision of all Company Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Company Stockholder, and the Indemnity Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of any Stockholder Representatives as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Company Stockholder. The Indemnity Agent and each Parent Group Member are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement any action by one of the then Stockholder Representatives shall be deemed to be the action of and binding upon all of the Stockholder Representatives.
 

 8. _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent believes may result in a demand against the Indemnity Fund, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representatives of such claim, and the Stockholder Representatives shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may not effect the settlement of any such claims without the consent of the Stockholder Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Stockholders Representatives have consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders Representatives shall have no power or authority to object under Section 8.4 or any other provision of this Article VIII to the amount paid in such settlement.
