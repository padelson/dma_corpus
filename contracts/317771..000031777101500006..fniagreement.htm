<P>2.<U>Representations and Warranties</U>.  The Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)The Stockholder is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good title to, the Subject Shares.  The Stockholder does not own, of record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the Subject Shares.
The Stockholder has the sole right to vote, and the sole power of disposition with respect to, the Subject Shares, and none of the Subject Shares is subject to any voting trust, proxy or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the
voting or disposition of such Subject Shares, except as contemplated by this Agreement except as set forth in Schedule A hereto, each of which shall terminate no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder.  Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of the Stockholder enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application which may
affect the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.  The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Stockholder does not and will not conflict with any agreement, order or other instrument binding upon
the Stockholder, nor require the Stockholder to make or obtain any regulatory filing or approval.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="TERMINATION"></A>3.<U>Termination</U>.  The obligations of the Stockholder hereunder shall
terminate upon the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 thereof or the Effective
Time.  No such termination shall relieve the Stockholder from any liability in connection with this Agreement incurred
prior to such termination.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.<U>Further Assurances</U>.  The Stockholder will, from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents and other instruments as Parent may reasonably
request for the purpose of effectively carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.<U>Successors, Assigns and Transferees Bound</U>.  Any successor, assignee or transferee
(including a successor, assignee or transferee as a result of the death of the Stockholder, such as an executor or heir)
shall be bound by the terms hereof, and the Stockholder shall take any and all actions necessary to obtain the written
confirmation from such successor, assignee or transferee that it is bound by the terms hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.<U>Remedies</U>.  The Stockholder acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and
an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it, and that any such breach would cause Parent irreparable
harm.  Accordingly, the Stockholder agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Parent,
in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a
bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.<U>Severability</U>.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement in such jurisdiction,
or the validity or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.<U>Amendment</U>.  This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written instrument executed
and delivered by both the Stockholder and Parent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.<U>Governing Law</U>.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.<U>Capitalized Terms</U>.  Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not defined herein
shall have such meanings as set forth in the Merger Agreement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.<U>Counterparts</U>.  For the convenience of the parties, this Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.<U>No limitation on Actions of the Stockholder as Director</U>.  In the event the Stockholder
is a director of the Company, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is

take to discharge the Stockholder's fiduciary duties as a director of the Company.</P>

exchange if listed on more than one) or in the NASDAQ National Market System, as the case may be, (ii) if such security is
 not listed or quoted as described in clause (i), the mean between the reported high bid and low asked prices of such
security on such date as reported in the financial press or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or (ii) if
neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) applies, the market value of such security on such day as determined in good faith by

Indemnity Agent in writing signed by Parent and one of the Stockholder Representatives.</P>
<P>c.Payments and deliveries pursuant to a Claim Notice shall be charged to and withdrawn from each Subaccount in
proportion to the respective balances in each, unless the Indemnity Agent is restrained, enjoined or stayed by law or court

shall be allocated pro rata among and withdrawn from the remaining Subaccounts as to which the Indemnity Agent is not so
restrained, enjoined or stayed.</P>

amount (the &quot;<U>Distribution Amount</U>&quot;)(specified in a written notice to the Indemnity Agent signed by Parent
and one of the Stockholder Representatives) equal to (A)&nbsp;the amount remaining in the Indemnity Fund, <U>less</U> (B)
any amount designated as subject to a Claim pursuant to such Claim Notice to the extent such Claim has not been resolved
prior to such date, and <U>less</U> (C) any amount previously designated in writing by the Stockholder Representatives to
the Indemnity Agent (with a copy delivered to Parent) as amounts that should be withheld to cover their expenses incurred

notice from the Stockholder Representatives to such effect in accordance with Section 8(b) and (ii) the Indemnity Agent
shall have not paid such amounts pursuant to Section 8(b)).  Subject to Section 5(e), upon its receipt of a Distribution
Notice, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, shall disburse the Distribution Amount from each Subaccount to
the Company Stockholder for which such Subaccount was established.  </P>
<P>b.Any amounts retained in escrow after the Distribution Date shall be held by the Indemnity Agent and shall first

resolution and payment out of the Indemnity Fund of all pending Claims, any remaining amounts in escrow shall be

their activities hereunder (to the extent the Indemnity Agent shall then have received written notice from the Stockholder
Representatives to such effect in accordance with Section 8(b) and shall not have already paid the Stockholder
Representatives therefor), and any remaining amounts shall be distributed to the Exchange Agent (or, if the agreement
appointing the Exchange Agent shall then have terminated, to Parent), who shall disburse such portion in the manner set

a writing signed by Parent and the Stockholder Representatives, release from the Indemnity Fund to Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as directed, the portion of the Indemnity Fund specified in such writing.</P>
<P>e.Within fifteen business days of receipt of a Parent Notice, Parent shall provide written notice (the &quot;<U>

Company Stock Options (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that, as of such date, are still outstanding but have not yet
vested (the &quot;<U>Stockholder Holdback Percentage</U>&quot;).  The Exchange Agent, pursuant to instructions signed by
Parent and one of the Stockholder Representatives (or, if the agreement appointing the Exchange Agent shall have then
terminated, Parent), shall subtract from amounts payable to the holder of each Company Stock Option pursuant to Section
1.5(c)(iii) an amount equal to the Stockholder Holdback Percentage <U>multiplied by</U> the balance in such Company
Stockholder's Subaccount and pay such amount to Parent to be held and later paid pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(1) of the
Merger Agreement.</P>
<P>f.Parent may provide the Indemnity Agent with the portion or percentage of each Company Stockholder's subaccount
attributable to Forfeited Option Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as of such date.  The Indemnity Agent will,
pursuant to instructions signed by Parent and one of the Stockholder Representatives, subtract from each Company
Stockholder's Subaccount an amount (a &quot;<U>Forfeiture Amount</U>&quot;) equal to the portion of such Subaccount that
is attributable to Forfeited Option Shares and credit to each Company Stockholder's Subaccount an amount equal to the
aggregate of all Forfeiture Amounts <U>multiplied by</U> such Company Stockholder's Stockholder Percentage; <U>provided
</U>, <U>however</U>, that for purposes of this Section 5(f) each Company Stockholder's Stockholder Percentage shall be
recalculated after subtracting from the numerator the number of Forfeited Option Shares held by such Company Stockholder
and subtracting from the denominator the total amount of Forfeited Option Shares for all Company Stockholders.</P>
<P>g.All additions to or subtractions from any subaccount, and all payments from the Indemnity Fund pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.</P>

<P>The Indemnity Agent is hereby authorized and directed to hold the Indemnity Fund in a segregated escrow account and to
disburse such Indemnity Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Indemnity Agreement.  From the date hereof until the
date of disbursement of the Indemnity Fund pursuant to Section 5 of this Indemnity Agreement, the Indemnity Agent is
authorized and directed to invest and reinvest the cash portion, if any, of the Indemnity Fund in any of the following
investments (each a &quot;<U>Permitted Investment</U>&quot;) in each case pursuant to joint instructions of the Parent and
the Stockholder Representatives: (i) readily marketable obligations maturing within six (6) months after the date of
acquisition thereof issued by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof; (ii) readily marketable
obligations maturing within six (6) months after the date of acquisition thereof issued by any state or municipality within
the United States of America, or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, rated &quot;A&quot; or better
by either Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service Inc.; (iii) readily marketable commercial paper
maturing within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of issuance thereof which has the highest credit rating of
either Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; or (iv) 6 month certificates of deposit issued
by any bank incorporated and doing business pursuant to the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof having
combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.  In the event the Indemnity Agent does not receive joint
instructions from Parent and the Stockholder Representatives to invest or reinvest the cash portion of the Indemnity Fund,
the Indemnity Agent agrees to invest and reinvest such funds in the Dreyfus Treasury Cash Management Fund, or a successor
or similar fund agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder Representatives in writing, which invests in direct obligations of,
or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government and repurchase agreements with
respect to such securities.  Permitted Investments and interest accruing on, and any profit resulting from, such investments
shall be added to, and become a part of, the Indemnity Fund pursuant to this Indemnity Agreement and shall be allocated
among the Subaccounts of the Company Stockholders based on the Permitted Investments credited to the Subaccount of each.
For purposes of this Indemnity Agreement, &quot;interest&quot; on the Indemnity Fund shall include all proceeds thereof and
investment earnings with respect thereto.  All Permitted Investments shall be registered in the name of the Indemnity Agent.  The Indemnity Agent shall have full power and authority to sell any and all Permitted Investments held by it under this
Indemnity Agreement as necessary to make disbursements under this Indemnity Agreement, and may use its Bond Department to effect such sales. The Indemnity Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Representatives shall not be
responsible for any unrealized profit or realized loss realized on such investments.</P><DIR>

<P>Section 7.<U>Liability and Compensation of Indemnity Agent</U>.</P>
<P>a.The duties and obligations of the Indemnity Agent hereunder shall be determined solely by the express provisions of
this Indemnity Agreement, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Indemnity Agreement against the
Indemnity Agent. The Indemnity Agent shall, in determining its duties hereunder, be under no obligation to refer to any
other documents between or among the parties related in any way to this Indemnity Agreement (except to the extent that
this Indemnity Agreement specifically refers to or incorporates by reference provisions of any other document), it being
specifically understood that the following provisions are accepted by all of the parties hereto.  Parent shall indemnify
and hold the Indemnity Agent harmless from and against any and all liability and expense which may arise out of any action
taken or omitted by the Indemnity Agent in accordance with this Indemnity Agreement, except such liability and expense as
may result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnity Agent. The reasonable costs and expenses of the
Indemnity Agent to enforce its indemnification rights under this Section 7(a) shall also be paid by Parent.  Parent shall be
entitled to be reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund for fifty percent (50%) of any amount that Parent is required to pay to
the Indemnity Agent pursuant to this Section 7(a), payable in the manner set forth in Section 5 hereof.  This right to
indemnification shall survive the termination of this Indemnity Agreement and removal or resignation of the Indemnity Agent.
With respect to any claims or actions against the Indemnity Agent which are indemnified by Parent under this Section 7,
Parent shall have the right to retain sole control over the defense, settlement, investigation and preparation related to
such claims or actions; provided that (i) the Indemnity Agent may employ its own counsel to defend such a claim or action
if it reasonably concludes, based on the advice of counsel, that there are defenses available to it which are different
from or additional to those available to Parent and (ii) neither Parent nor the Indemnity Agent shall settle or compromise
any such claim or action without the consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</P>
<P>b.The Indemnity Agent shall not be liable to any person by reason of any error of judgment or for any act done or
step taken or omitted by it, or for any mistake of fact or law or anything which it may do or refrain from doing in
connection herewith unless caused by or arising out of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.</P>
<P>c.The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be protected in acting in reliance upon, any
instructions or directions furnished to it in writing signed by both Parent and one of the then Stockholder Representatives
pursuant to any provision of this Indemnity Agreement and shall be entitled to treat as genuine, and as the document it
purports to be, any letter, paper or other document furnished to it by any Parent Group Member or the Stockholder
Representatives, and believed by the Indemnity Agent to be genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper
party or parties.  In performing its obligations hereunder, the Indemnity Agent may consult with counsel to the Indemnity
Agent and shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be protected in acting in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such
counsel.</P>
<P>d.The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to the compensation set forth in <U>Exhibit A</U> hereto for the performance
of services by the Indemnity Agent hereunder for each year or portion thereof that any portion of the Indemnity Fund
remains in escrow and shall be reimbursed for reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
performance of such services (such fees, costs and expenses are hereinafter referred to as the &quot;<U>Indemnity Agent's
Compensation</U>&quot;).  The Indemnity Agent shall render statements to Parent setting forth in detail the Indemnity
Agent's Compensation and the basis upon which the Indemnity Agent's Compensation was computed.  The Indemnity Agent's
Compensation shall be paid by Parent. To the extent Indemnity Agent's Compensation is not paid by Parent, the foregoing
shall be paid from the Indemnity Fund after written notice from the Indemnity Agent to Parent.  Parent shall be entitled
to be reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund for fifty percent (50%) of any amount that Parent is required to pay to the
Indemnity Agent pursuant to such reimbursement obligation, payable in the manner set forth in Section 4 hereof.</P>
<P>e.The Indemnity Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) business days written notice to Parent and the
Stockholder Representatives; <U>provided</U> that such resignation shall not be effective unless and until a successor
Indemnity Agent has been appointed and accepts such position pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.  In such event,
Parent and the Stockholder Representatives shall appoint a successor Indemnity Agent or, if Parent and the Stockholder
Representatives are unable to agree upon a successor Indemnity Agent within thirty (30) business days after such notice,
the Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to (i) appoint its own successor, provided that such successor is a reputable national
banking association or (ii) at the equal expense of Parent and the Stockholder Representatives, petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. Such appointment, whether by Parent and the
Stockholder Representatives, on the one hand, or the Indemnity Agent, on the other hand, shall be effective on the effective
date of the aforesaid resignation (the &quot;<U>Indemnity Transfer Date</U>&quot;).  On the Indemnity Transfer Date, all
right title and interest to the Indemnity Fund, including interest thereon, shall be transferred to the successor Indemnity
Agent and this Indemnity Agreement shall be assigned by the Indemnity Agent to such successor Indemnity Agent, and
thereafter, the resigning Indemnity Agent shall be released from any further obligations hereunder.  The Indemnity Agent
shall be paid any outstanding fees and expenses prior to transferring assets to a successor indemnity agent.  The Indemnity
Agent shall continue to serve until its successor is appointed, accepts the Indemnity Agreement and receives the transferred
Indemnity Fund.</P>
<P>f.The Indemnity Agent shall not have any right, claim or interest in any portion of the Indemnity Fund except in its
capacity as Indemnity Agent hereunder.</P>
<P>g.It is understood and agreed that in the event any disagreement among Parent and the Stockholder Representatives
results in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the Indemnity Fund, or in the event the Indemnity Agent
in good faith is in doubt as to what action it should take hereunder, the Indemnity Agent shall retain the Indemnity Fund
until the Indemnity Agent shall have received (i) an enforceable final order of a court of competent jurisdiction which is
not subject to further appeal directing delivery of the Indemnity Fund or (ii) a written agreement executed by Parent and
the Stockholder Representatives directing delivery of the Indemnity Fund, in which event Indemnity Agent shall disburse the
Indemnity Fund in accordance with such order or agreement.  Any court order referred to in clause (i) immediately above
shall be accompanied by a legal opinion of counsel for the presenting party satisfactory to the Indemnity Agent to the
effect that said court order or judgment is final and enforceable and is not subject to further appeal.  The Indemnity
Agent shall act on such court order and legal opinion without further question.</P>
<P>h.In no event shall the Indemnity Agent be liable in connection with this Indemnity Agreement for any special,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, even if the Indemnity Agent has been previously advised
of such loss or damage.</P>
<P>i.The Indemnity Agent shall provide Parent and the Stockholder Representatives with such information and assistance
as may be requested from time to time to carry out any of the calculations contemplated hereby to be performed by Parent.</P>
<P>Section 8.<U>Stockholder Representatives</U>.</P>
<P>a.Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder Representatives shall act as agents of the Company Stockholders
and are entitled to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to the Parent Group Members of the
cash or other property from the Indemnity Fund in satisfaction of claims by the Parent Group Members, to object to such
deliveries in accordance with the terms of this Indemnity Agreement, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such

accomplishment of the foregoing.  The persons designated to be Stockholders Representatives may be changed in accordance
with the provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement.</P>
<P>b.From time to time, but at least five (5) days prior to the Distribution Date, the Stockholder Representatives
shall deliver notice to the Indemnity Agent and Parent setting forth the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by
the Stockholder Representatives in connection with their duties under the Merger Agreement and hereunder (the &quot;<U>
Stockholder Representatives' Expenses</U>&quot;), which expenses shall be reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund (x) promptly
following receipt of such notice, until such reimbursements equal $250,000 in total, and (y) thereafter in accordance with
the provision of Section 5(b) hereof.</P>
<P>c.Neither Parent, any Parent Group Member nor the Indemnity Agent shall be responsible or liable for any acts or
omissions of any Stockholder Representative in such Stockholder Representative's capacity as such, and each of them may
rely on any action or writing any Stockholder Representative as being binding on all Stockholder Representatives for all
purposes.</P>
<P>d.A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representatives shall constitute a decision of all
Company Stockholders for whom amounts otherwise payable to them are deposited in the Indemnity Fund and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Company Stockholder, and the Indemnity Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representatives as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
and every such Company Stockholder.  The Indemnity Agent and each Parent Group Member are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representatives.  For purposes of this Indemnity Agreement any action by one of the then Stockholder
Representatives shall be deemed to be the action of and binding upon all of the Stockholder Representatives.</P>

(the &quot;<U>Initial Indemnity Amount</U>&quot;) with LaSalle Bank National Association (or another institution selected
by Parent with the reasonable consent of the Company) as indemnity and escrow agent (the &quot;<U>Indemnity Agent</U>
&quot;).  Such deposit shall constitute the initial Indemnity Fund (as defined in the Indemnity Agreement) and shall be
governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Indemnity Agreement. Any Holdback Escrow Amount shall be added to the
Indemnity Fund.  The Indemnity Fund shall be available to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse any Parent Group Member
from any Loss or Expense indemnifiable under this Article VIII and as provided in the Indemnity Agreement.</LI>
<LI>Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Company for any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant if this Agreement shall be terminated, provided that, subject to Section 1.5(f)(xviii)(6), resort to the Indemnity
Fund shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parent Group Members for any such breaches and misrepresentations following the
Effective Time other than for fraud.</LI>
<LI>As used in this Agreement, (i)  &quot;<U>Expense</U>&quot; means any and all expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending or asserting any claim, action, suit or proceeding incident to any matter indemnified against
hereunder (including, without limitation, court filing fees, court costs, arbitration fees or costs, witness fees and
reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel, investigators, expert witnesses, consultants, accountants and other
professionals), (ii) &quot;<U>Loss</U>&quot; means any and all losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, settlement
payments, awards, judgments, fines, penalties, damages, expenses, deficiencies or other charges, and (iii) &quot;<U>Parent

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation.</LI></OL>

<LI><U>Indemnification from Indemnity Fund</U>.  </LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Subject to Section 8.1, from and after the Effective Time, each Parent Group Member shall be indemnified, held harmless
and reimbursed from the Indemnity Fund from and against any and all Loss and Expense incurred by such Parent Group Member in
connection with or arising from:</LI>
<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>any breach or failure to perform by the Company of any of its agreements, covenants or obligations in this Agreement;
or</LI>
<LI>any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of the Company contained in Article III or any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Article VI of this Agreement;<BR>
<BR>
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnity Fund shall be used to indemnify and hold harmless hereunder with
respect to the matters set forth in clause (ii) of this Section 8.2(a) (other than Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.9, 3.20, 3.28,
the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(a) to the extent it relates to such Sections, and the certificates
delivered pursuant to Sections 6.3(g), 6.3(h) and 6.3(i), as to which this proviso shall not apply) only in the event that
the aggregate amount (without duplication) of Loss and Expense borne by the Parent Group Members with respect thereto
exceeds $150,000, at which point this proviso shall no longer apply and the Parent Group Members shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder with respect to all such aggregate amount of Loss and Expense and any Loss or Expense incurred
or suffered by them thereafter.  Any payment pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be made in the form of a transfer from the
Indemnity Fund to the applicable Parent Group Member(s) pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement.</LI></OL>

<LI>The Company acknowledges that Parent and the Company have agreed that Parent will acquire all of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  The Company further
acknowledges that the information set forth in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(g) will be used as the
basis for determining the Merger Consideration.  In the event of any inaccuracy in the certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 6.3(g), Parent will be entitled (but not obligated) to recalculate the Merger Consideration and receive an amount
from the Indemnity Fund such that the aggregate merger consideration paid by Parent, Sub or the Surviving Corporation to
the holders of equity interests in the Company (including, without limitation, holders of options) in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed such consideration assuming information set forth in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(g) was true and correct in all respects at the Effective Time.</LI>
<LI>The indemnification provided for in this Article VIII shall terminate on the first day following eighteen full months
after the Effective Time (and no claims shall be made by any Parent Group Member under this Section 8.2 thereafter), except
that such indemnification shall continue as to any Loss or Expense in connection with which a Claim Notice is given in
accordance with the requirements of Section 8.4 on or prior to the date such indemnification obligation would otherwise
terminate in accordance with this Section 8.2, as to which the indemnification obligation hereunder shall continue until
the liability to be satisfied from the Indemnity Fund shall have been determined pursuant to this Article VIII, and all
Parent Group Members shall have been reimbursed out of the Indemnity Fund for such Loss or Expense in accordance with the
terms hereof.</LI></OL>

<LI><U>Termination of Indemnity Fund</U>.  Upon termination of the indemnification obligations under this Article VIII and
reimbursement of the Parent Group Members of Losses and Expenses payable in respect thereof hereunder, the Indemnity Fund
shall terminate and shall be distributed in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement after payment of any amounts therefrom
due to the Indemnity Agent.</LI>
<LI><U>Notice and Determination of Claims</U>.</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>If any Parent Group Member wishes to make a claim for indemnification to be satisfied from the Indemnity Fund, such
Parent Group Member (individually or collectively, the &quot;<U>Claiming Party</U>&quot;) shall so notify the Indemnity
Agent in writing (the &quot;<U>Claim Notice</U>&quot;) of the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification
hereunder.  The Claim Notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Claiming Party attesting to the Claiming Party's
contemporaneous delivery of a duplicate copy of the Claim Notice to the Stockholder Representatives (as hereinafter
defined).  Such Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known) the Loss or Expense and the
method of computation of such Loss or Expense and contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such Loss or Expense shall have occurred.  If the Claiming Party is not Parent, the Claim Notice must be accompanied
by a certificate from Parent confirming that the Claiming Party is a Parent Group Member.  At the time of delivery of any
Claim Notice to the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by the Claiming Party to the
Stockholder Representatives.</LI>
<LI>Unless the Stockholder Representatives shall have delivered an Objection in accordance with Section 8.4(c), the
Indemnity Agent shall, on the twentieth day (or such earlier day as the Stockholder Representatives shall authorize in
writing to the Indemnity Agent) after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to indemnification for a specified amount,
deliver to Parent, for its account or for the account of each Parent Group Member named in the Claim Notice, such portion
of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the specified amount.</LI>
<LI>Until the twentieth day following delivery of a Claim Notice, the Stockholder Representatives may deliver to the
Indemnity Agent a written objection (an &quot;<U>Objection</U>&quot;) to the claim made in such Claim Notice.  At the time
of delivery of any Objection to the Indemnity Agent, a duplicate copy of such Objection shall be delivered to the Claiming
Party.</LI>
<LI>Upon receipt of an Objection properly made, the Indemnity Agent shall (i) deliver to Parent, for its account or for the
account of each Parent Group Member named in the Claim Notice, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance
with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to that portion of the amount subject to the Claim Notice, if any, which
is not disputed by the Stockholder Representatives and (ii) designate and segregate out of the Indemnity Fund a portion
thereof, valued in accordance with the Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the amount subject to the Claim Notice
which is disputed by the Stockholder Representatives.  Thereafter, the Indemnity Agent shall not dispose of such segregated
portion of the Indemnity Fund until the Indemnity Agent shall have received a certified copy of the final decision of the
arbitrators as contemplated by Section 8.5, or the Indemnity Agent shall have received a copy of the written agreement
between the Claiming Party and the Stockholder Representatives resolving such dispute and setting forth the amount, if any,
which such Claiming Party is entitled to receive.  The Indemnity Agent will deliver to Parent, for its account or for the
account of each Parent Group Member entitled to payment, such portion of the Indemnity Fund, valued in accordance with the
Indemnity Agreement, with a value equal to the amount that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive as set forth in the
arbitration decision after the expiration of ten (10) business days from the receipt of such decision or, in the event that
the amount to which the Claiming Party is entitled is established pursuant to an agreement between the Claiming Party and
the Stockholder Representatives, promptly after the Indemnity Agent's receipt of such agreement.</LI></OL>

<LI><U>Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration</U>.</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>The Claiming Party shall deliver a written response to the Stockholder Representatives in respect of any Objection
properly delivered by the Stockholder Representatives.  If after twenty (20) days following delivery of such response there
remains a dispute as to any claims, the Stockholder Representatives and the Claiming Party shall attempt in good faith for
sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.  If the Stockholder
Representatives and the Claiming Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both and shall be furnished to the Indemnity Agent.  The Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and shall distribute the Parent Common Stock or other property from the Indemnity Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof.</LI>
<LI>If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either the Claiming Party or the Stockholder
Representatives may, by written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss or
Expense is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such
amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by three arbitrators.  Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, Parent and the
Stockholder Representatives shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator.  The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in the related Claim Notice shall
be binding, and conclusive, and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5, the Indemnity Agent shall be entitled to act
in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Indemnity Fund in accordance therewith.</LI>
<LI>Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  Any such
arbitration shall be held in Chicago, Illinois under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association.  The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including without limitation, attorneys' fees
and costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the arbitration.</LI></OL>

<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>The &quot;Stockholder Representatives&quot; shall be Andy Y.T. Chan and Michael Rand, who may be replaced by the
Company prior to the Effective Time.  Each of the Stockholder Representatives shall be constituted and appointed as
exclusive agent for and on behalf of the Company Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
