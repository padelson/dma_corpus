AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of this 13th day of November, 2015, by and between HIGH POINT BANK
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _HPBC_ " and, unless the context
otherwise requires, the term "HPBC" shall include HPBC and its wholly-owned
subsidiary bank, HIGH POINT BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, a North Carolina bank
(the " _Bank_ ")), and BNC BANCORP, a North Carolina corporation (" _BNC_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of HPBC and BNC deem it advisable
and in the best interests of each such entity and their respective
shareholders that HPBC merge with and into BNC (the " _Merger_ "), with BNC
being the surviving corporation;

  



  

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the respective entities believe that the
merger of HPBC and BNC and their subsidiary banks will enhance and
strengthen the franchises and future prospects of both companies and each of
the banks;

  



  

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which as legally
sufficient consideration are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I _ 
 MERGER_

  



  

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, HPBC shall merge with and into BNC in
accordance with Section 55-11-06 of the North Carolina Business Corporation
Act (the " _North Carolina_ _Code_ ") and Section 252 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of HPBC (sometimes referred to as the " _Merged Corporation_ ")
shall cease, and BNC shall survive and continue to exist as a corporation
incorporated under the North Carolina Code (BNC, as the surviving entity in
the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and shall continue under the name "BNC Bancorp." The
Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises, as well of a public nature as of a private nature, of
each of the Merged Corporation and the Surviving Corporation; and all
property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on whatever account,
and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest of or
belonging to or due to each of the Merged Corporation and the Surviving
Corporation shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in
the Surviving Corporation without further act or deed, and the title to any
real estate or any interest therein, vested in either of the Merged
Corporation or the Surviving Corporation shall not revert or be in any way
impaired by reason of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation shall thenceforth
be responsible and liable for all the liabilities, obligations and penalties
of each of the Merged Corporation and the Surviving Corporation; and any
claim existing or action or proceeding, civil or criminal, pending by or
against either of the Merged Corporation or the Surviving Corporation may be
prosecuted as if the Merger had not taken place, or the Surviving Corporation
may be substituted in its place, and any judgment rendered against either of
the Merged Corporation or the Surviving Corporation may thenceforth be
enforced against the Surviving Corporation; and neither the rights of
creditors nor any liens upon the property of either of the Merged Corporation
or the Surviving Corporation shall be impaired by the Merger. The "
_Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time at which the Merger shall be
effective upon the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the
Merged Corporation and the filing of the articles of merger (the " _Articles
of Merger_ ") with the North Carolina Secretary of State and the certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Delaware Secretary of
State pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

  



  

   



 



    



  

1.2 _Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:

  



  

(i) " _BNC VWAP_ " means the volume weighted average price of a
share of BNC's voting common stock, no par value per share (" _BNC Stock_ "),
for a twenty (20) trading day period, starting with the opening of trading on
the twentieth (20th) trading day prior to the Effective Time and ending with
the closing of trading on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time,
as reported by Bloomberg Financial L.P.

  



  

(ii) " _Cash Consideration_ " means the aggregate amount of cash to
be paid by BNC as Merger Consideration.

  



  

(iii) " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " means $300.00.

  



  

(iv) " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ " means, a number of shares of
BNC Stock, which number of shares of BNC of Stock shall vary based on the BNC
VWAP, as follows:

  



     **BNC VWAP**   |   | **Per Share Stock Consideration** 
---|---|--- 
   less than $18.90  |   | 15.8730 shares of BNC Stock 
     |   | 
   $18.90 - $22.24  |   | the number of shares of BNC Stock equal to $300
divided by the BNC VWAP 
     |   | 
   $22.25 - $25.60  |   | the number of shares of BNC Stock equal to $300
divided by the BNC VWAP 
     |   | 
   more than $25.60  |   | 11.7188 shares of BNC Stock 
  



  

(v) " _Stock Consideration_ " means the aggregate amount of BNC Stock
to be paid as Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) Each share of BNC stock (of any class) that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the
Merger.

  



  

(c) Each share of HPBC common stock, $5.00 par value per share ("
_HPBC Stock_ "), owned directly by BNC (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts or other similar accounts for the benefit of customers or
shares held as collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

--- 

 



    



  

(d) Each share of HPBC Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock, Dissenting Shares and
Cancelled Shares) shall, subject in all cases to _Section 1.4_ , become and be
converted at the election of the holder thereof, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 1.3_ , into the right to receive, without
interest, the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash
Consideration (collectively, and in the aggregate, as adjusted in accordance
with the terms hereof, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each certificate
previously representing shares of HPBC Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ," it
being understood that any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed,
as appropriate, to include reference to book-entry account statements relating
to the ownership of shares of HPBC Stock, and it being further understood
that provisions herein relating to Certificates shall be interpreted in a
manner that appropriately accounts for book-entry shares, including that, in
lieu of delivery of a Certificate and a Letter of Transmittal, shares held
in book-entry form may be transferred by means of an "agent's message" to the
Exchange Agent or such other evidence of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) shall thereafter represent, subject to _Section 1.5(d)_ ,
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) No scrip or fractional share certificates of BNC Stock shall be
issued in connection with the Merger and an outstanding fractional share
interest will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to receive dividends or
to have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such fractional
interest. In lieu of any fractional interest, there shall be paid in cash,
without interest, an amount (computed to the nearest cent) equal to such
fraction multiplied by the BNC VWAP.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, shares of HPBC Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal
rights in respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporate Law (the " _DGCL_ ") (such shares being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights
under applicable law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to
payment of such consideration as may be determined to be due in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such
shares of HPBC Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 1.2_ , as Stock Election Shares, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of such shares of HPBC Stock. HPBC shall give prompt
notice to BNC of any demands received by HPBC for appraisal, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by HPBC relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and BNC
shall direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, HPBC shall not, without the prior
written consent of BNC, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do
any such appraisal demands.

  



  

(g) If either party should change the number of its outstanding
shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with
respect to such shares prior to the Effective Time, then the shares to be
issued hereunder to holders of HPBC Stock shall be proportionately and
appropriately adjusted; _provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no such
adjustment shall be made with regard to the BNC Stock if (i) BNC issues
additional shares of BNC Stock and receives consideration for such shares in
a bona fide merger, acquisition or other business combination or any
other third party transaction, or (ii) BNC issues stock options, restricted
stock or restricted stock units or grants or similar equity awards or BNC
Stock upon exercise or vesting of any such grants or awards.

1.3 _Election Procedures_.

  



  

(a) An election form (" _Election Form_ ") together with the Letter
of Transmittal and any other transmittal materials described in _Section 1.5_
shall be mailed no later than five (5) business days after the Closing Date
(the mailing date of such form of election being referred to herein as the "
_Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of HPBC Stock of record at the Effective
Time. Each Election Form shall permit a holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instruction) of HPBC
Stock to elect to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share
Cash Consideration with respect to each share of such holder's (or beneficial
owner's) HPBC Stock.

  



  

(b) An election pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by 5:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time
on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the Mailing Date, or such
other time and date as BNC and HPBC may mutually agree (the " _Election
Deadline_ "). An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates covered by such Election Form (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates), together
with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal. Any Election Form may be revoked
or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form (or the beneficial
owner of the shares covered by such Election Form through appropriate
and customary documentation and instruction) at or prior to the Election
Deadline. If an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline and
no other valid election is made, the shares of HPBC Stock subject to such
Election Form shall be Stock Election Shares. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither the BNC nor the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

  



  

(c) Shares of HPBC Stock as to which a proper election is made for
the Per Share Stock Consideration, and shares of HPBC Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares) with respect to which the holder (or the beneficial
owner, as the case may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an
effective, properly completed Election Form, are referred to herein as "
_Stock Election Shares_." Shares of HPBC Stock as to which a proper election
is made for the Per Share Cash Consideration are referred to herein as "
_Cash Election Shares_."

  



  

1.4 _Allocation of the Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Cash Consideration Limit_
" means the maximum amount of Cash Consideration payable by BNC in the
Merger, and (ii) " _Stock Consideration Limit_ " means the maximum amount of
Stock Consideration payable by BNC in the Merger, which limits shall vary,
based on the BNC VWAP, as follows:

  



  

   

4 
--- 

 



    



     **BNC VWAP**   |   | **Stock Consideration Limit**   |   |
**Cash Consideration Limit** 
---|---|---|---|--- 
   less than $18.90  |   | 4,444,205 shares of BNC Stock  |   |
$57,267,325 
     |   |   |   | 
   $18.90 - $22.24  |   | 4,444,205 shares of BNC Stock  |   |
$57,267,325 
     |   |   |   | 
   $22.25 - $25.60  |   | 3,862,000 shares of BNC Stock  |   |
$42,379,238 
     |   |   |   | 
   more than $25.60  |   | 3,862,000 shares of BNC Stock  |   |
$42,379,238 
  



  

(b) If the number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of valid
and properly completed Election Forms received by the Election
Deadline) would result in an amount of Stock Consideration in excess of the
Stock Consideration Limit, then:

  



  

(i) Each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration;

  



  

(ii) The Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election
Shares, _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective numbers of Stock
Election Shares held by the holders of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient
number of Stock Election Shares (" _Converted Stock Election Shares_ ") so
that the number of shares of BNC Stock issuable in exchange for the Stock
Election Shares remaining after such allocation equals as closely as
practicable the Stock Consideration Limit, and each Converted Stock
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration; and

  



  

(iii) Each Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

  



  

(c) If the number of Cash Election Shares (on the basis of valid and
properly completed Election Forms received by the Election Deadline) would
result in an amount of Total Cash Consideration in excess of the Cash
Consideration Limit, then:

  



  

(i) Each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

  



  

(ii) The Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash Election
Shares, _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective numbers of Cash Election
Shares held by the holders of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of
Cash Election Shares (" _Converted Cash Election Shares_ ") so that the Cash
Consideration payable with respect to the Cash Election Shares
remaining after such allocation equals as closely as practicable the Cash
Consideration Limit, and each Converted Cash Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and

  



  

(iii) Each Cash Election Share that is not a Converted Cash Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration.

(d) The table attached set forth in _Schedule 1.4(d)_ illustrates
how the Merger Consideration would be allocated, on an aggregate basis,
between Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration, depending upon the
applicable BNC VWAP.

  



  

1.5 _Delivery of the Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, BNC shall appoint a bank or
trust company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, for the benefit of the holders of HPBC
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this  _Section 1.5_ , through the
Exchange Agent, the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 1.2_ , based on the applicable BNC VWAP, and BNC shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if
applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any
dividends or other distributions represented by such deposited shares (such
shares of BNC Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). BNC shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 1.2(e)_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by BNC pending payment thereof by
the Exchange Agent to the holders of HPBC Stock pursuant to this _Article_ I;
provided that no investment of such deposited funds directed by BNC shall
relieve BNC or the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required
by this _Article_ I, and following any losses from any such investment, BNC
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of HPBC Stock, in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Exchange Agent. BNC shall direct the Exchange
Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former holders of HPBC
Stock and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with
_Article_ I. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
fund payments pursuant to _ARTICLE I_ , except as expressly provided for in
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) BNC shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail on the Mailing Date
to each holder of record of HPBC Stock as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the holder's Certificate or Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have
such other provisions as BNC may reasonably specify (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "); (ii) an Election Form; and (iii) instructions for electing
the Merger Consideration to be received for each share of HPBC Stock and
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of such
Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, and delivery of
a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, with respect to
such Certificates, the record holder of such Certificates shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to be paid therefor
pursuant to this _Article _ I. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of HPBC shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of HPBC Stock on the records of HPBC. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article_ I with respect to any HPBC Stock
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining thereto. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares
of HPBC Stock outstanding immediately prior thereto shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable law.

  



  

   

6 
--- 

 



    



  

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to BNC Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered HPBC Stock with respect to
the shares of BNC Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the
surrender of each outstanding share of such HPBC Stock in accordance with
this _Section 1.5_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such share of such HPBC
Stock in accordance with this _Section 1.5_ , the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to the whole shares of BNC Stock represented by such HPBC Stock
and paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
shares of BNC Stock represented by such HPBC Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date
subsequent to the issuance of the BNC Stock issuable with respect to such HPBC
Stock.

  



  

(e) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
entity, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any
interest or investment income received with respect thereto) not disbursed to
holders of HPBC Stock, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and
compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.5_ , without interest.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of HPBC Stock for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue
in exchange therefor upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration into which such shares of HPBC Stock
formerly represented thereby were converted pursuant to _Article_ I; provided,
however, that the Exchange Agent, or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of such Merger Consideration, as applicable, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a customary
indemnity agreement or provide a bond in a customary amount.

  



  

(g) The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Merger Consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any individual or entity (a " _Person_ ") such amounts, if
any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
remitted to the appropriate governmental authority by or on behalf of BNC,
such amounts withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by BNC.

  



  

1.6 _Closing_. The transactions contemplated herein shall be
consummated (the " _Closing_ ") at the offices of Troutman Sanders LLP, 600
Peachtree Street NE, Suite 5200, Atlanta, Georgia, 30308, on the first
business day of the month that begins immediately following the satisfaction
or waiver in accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth
in _Articles VI_ , _VII_ and _VIII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), or at
such other time, date and place as may be mutually agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto. On the Closing Date, BNC shall file the Articles of
Merger with the North Carolina Secretary of State and the Certificate of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State.

  



  

1.7 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. The Articles of Incorporation of BNC, as amended, shall at
the Effective Time be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation. Until altered, amended or repealed, as therein provided, the
Bylaws of BNC, as amended, as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.8 _Directors of Surviving Corporation_. Subject to _Section
2.11(a)_ , the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Merger shall be the directors of BNC in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

  



  

1.9 _Tax Free Reorganization_.

  



  

(a) Each of BNC and HPBC shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of BNC, HPBC or their respective
subsidiaries shall take, or agree to take, fail to take, or agree to fail to
take, any action (including any action otherwise permitted by this Agreement)
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Pursuant to the foregoing, each of BNC and HPBC agrees to make such
commercially reasonable additions or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement as may be reasonably necessary to permit the Merger to so qualify.

  



  

(b) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, each of BNC and
HPBC (i) shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) shall not take any Tax reporting position
inconsistent with such characterization and (iii) shall properly file with
their federal income Tax Returns all information required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-3.

  



  

(c) Officers of BNC and HPBC shall execute and deliver to Troutman
Sanders LLP and Robinson, Bradshaw and Hinson, P.A., respectively,
certificates containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel, at such time or times as
may be reasonably requested by such counsel, including the effective date of
the Registration Statement and the Closing Date, in connection with the
rendering by such counsel of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the
Merger.

  



  

1.10 _Bank Merger_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Bank of North Carolina, BNC's wholly owned North Carolina
bank subsidiary (" _Bank of NC_ "), and the Bank are entering into the
Agreement and Plan of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Bank
Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Bank will merge with and into
Bank of NC with Bank of NC being the surviving bank (the " _Bank Merger_
"). The Bank Merger shall not occur prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

1.11 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
BNC shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
documents, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary
or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in BNC
its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of HPBC, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by BNC.

ARTICLE II _ 
 OTHER AGREEMENTS_

  



  

2.1 _Registration and Listing of BNC Stock_.

  



  

(a) BNC agrees to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable a registration statement
(the " _BNC Registration Statement_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _1933 Act_ "), on Form S-4 or some other appropriate form
covering the issuance of the shares of BNC Stock to the shareholders of HPBC
pursuant to this Agreement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the BNC Registration Statement to become effective and to remain
effective through the Effective Time. BNC agrees to take any action required
to be taken under the applicable state securities laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of BNC Stock upon consummation of the Merger. HPBC agrees
to provide BNC reasonable assistance as necessary in the preparation of the
BNC Registration Statement, including, without limitation, providing BNC with
all material facts regarding the operations, business, assets, liabilities and
personnel of HPBC, together with the audited financial statements of HPBC,
all as and to the extent required by the 1933 Act and the rules, regulations
and practices of the SEC, for inclusion in the BNC Registration Statement. The
BNC Registration Statement shall not cover resales of BNC Stock by any of the
shareholders of HPBC, and BNC shall have no obligation to cause the BNC
Registration Statement to continue to be effective after the Effective Time
or to prepare or file any post-effective amendments to the BNC
Registration Statement after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) BNC agrees to list on the NASDAQ Capital Market, by the Closing
Date, the shares of BNC Stock to be issued to the shareholders of
HPBC pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

2.2 _Meeting of HPBC Shareholders_.

  



  

(a) HPBC shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably
practicable (but no more than twenty (20) business days) after the BNC
Registration Statement becomes effective under the 1933 Act for the purpose
of submitting the Merger and this Agreement to such shareholders for their
approval. In connection with the Special Meeting, BNC and HPBC shall
together prepare and submit to the HPBC shareholders a notice of
meeting, proxy statement and proxy (the " _HPBC Proxy Materials_ "), which
shall include the final prospectus from the BNC Registration Statement in the
form filed with the SEC.

  



  

(b) Except as provided in this _Section 2.2(b)_ , the board of
directors HPBC shall (i) communicate to the shareholders of HPBC the
board's recommendation that the shareholders adopt and approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the " _HPBC
Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the HPBC Recommendation in the HPBC Proxy
Materials. Neither the HPBC board of directors nor any committee thereof
shall: (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to BNC, the HPBC
Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) (each, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), except that, prior to the Requisite HPBC
Shareholder Approval, HPBC's board of directors may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if:

  



  

(A) HPBC's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with HPBC's financial advisor and outside counsel, that it has
received an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
_Section 4.18_ ) that is a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(B) HPBC's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with HPBC's outside counsel, that a failure to accept
such Superior Proposal would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of
the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of HPBC;

  



  

(C) HPBC's board of directors provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") to BNC of its receipt of the Superior Proposal and
its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on the third business
day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (it being understood
that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Recommendation Change);

  



  

   

9 
--- 

 



    



  

(D) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, HPBC
negotiates in good faith with BNC (if requested by BNC) and provides BNC
reasonable opportunity during the three-business-day period following the
Notice of Recommendation Change to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable HPBC's board of directors to
proceed without an Adverse Recommendation Change (provided, however, that BNC
shall not be required to propose any such adjustments); and

  



  

(E) HPBC's board of directors, following such three-business-day
period, determines in good faith, after consultation with HPBC's
financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the members of the board of directors of HPBC.

  



  

(c) The term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or
offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation,
dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
rights offering, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction,
involving HPBC or any of its subsidiaries; and (ii) any acquisition by any
Person resulting in, or proposal or offer, which, if consummated, would
result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
of ten percent (10%) or more of the total voting power of any class of equity
securities of HPBC or any of its subsidiaries, or ten percent (10%) or more
of the consolidated total assets of HPBC, in each case, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The term " _Superior Proposal_ _"_ means any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to which the board of directors of HPBC (i) determines
in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be consummated on a timely basis, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) determines in its good faith
judgment (based on, among other things, the advice of HPBC's financial
advisor) to be more favorable to HPBC's shareholders than the Merger taking
into account all relevant factors (including whether, in the good faith
judgment of the board of directors of HPBC, after obtaining the advice of the
HPBC's financial advisor, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably able to finance the transaction and close it timely, and
any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by BNC in
response to such Acquisition Proposal).

  



  

2.3 _Access to Properties, Books, Etc_. Each party shall allow
the other party and its authorized representatives full access, upon
reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours from and after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date to all of such party's properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records and those of its subsidiaries and
shall furnish the other party and its authorized representatives such
information concerning its affairs and the affairs of its subsidiaries as the
other party may reasonably request, provided that such request shall be
reasonably related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall not interfere unreasonably with normal operations. Each party shall
cause its and its subsidiaries' personnel, employees and other
representatives to assist such other party in making any such investigation.
During such investigation, each party and its authorized representatives
shall have the right to make copies of such records, files, tax returns and
other materials as it may deem advisable and shall advise the other party of
those items of which copies are made. No investigation made heretofore or
hereafter by either party and its authorized representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties of either such party hereunder.

2.4 _Confidentiality_. Prior to consummation of the Merger, the
parties to this Agreement have provided and will provide one another with
information which may be deemed by the party providing the information to be
confidential, including, without limitation, information regarding such
party's operations, customers (including consumer financial information),
business and financial condition. Each party agrees that it will hold
confidential and protect all information provided to it by each other party or
such party's affiliates or representatives, except that the obligations
contained in this _Section 2.4_ shall not in any way restrict the rights of
any party to use information that: (a) was known to such party prior to the
disclosure by the other party; (b) is or becomes generally available to the
public other than by breach of this Agreement; (c) is provided by one party
for disclosure concerning such party in the BNC Registration Statement; or
(d) otherwise becomes lawfully available to a party to this Agreement on a
non-confidential basis from a third party who is not under an obligation of
confidence to the other party to this Agreement. If this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing, upon request each party hereto agrees to
return all documents, statements and other written materials, whether or not
confidential, and all copies thereof, provided to it by or on behalf of the
other party to this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 2.4_ shall
survive termination, for any reason whatsoever, of this Agreement, and,
without limiting the remedies of the parties hereto in the event of any
breach of this _Section 2.4_ , the parties hereto will be entitled to seek
injunctive relief against the other party in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

2.5 _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary or advisable so as to permit consummation of
the Merger as promptly as practicable and shall cooperate fully with each
other to that end.

  



  

2.6 _Expenses_. All of the expenses incurred by BNC in connection
with the authorization, preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, all
fees and expenses of its agents, representatives, counsel and accountants and
the fees and expenses related to filing the BNC Registration Statement and all
regulatory applications with state and federal authorities in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, shall be paid by BNC. All
expenses incurred by HPBC in connection with the authorization, preparation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement,
including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of its agents,
representatives, counsel and accountants in connection with all regulatory

2.7 _Preservation of Goodwill_. Each party hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business organization and the
business organizations of its subsidiaries, to keep available the services of
its present employees and of the present employees of its subsidiaries, and
to preserve the goodwill of customers and others having business relations
with such party or its subsidiaries.

  



  

2.8 _Approvals and Consents_. Each party hereto represents and
warrants to and covenants with the other that it will use its commercially
reasonable efforts, and will cause its officers, directors, employees and
agents and its subsidiaries and any subsidiary's officers, directors,
employees and agents to use their commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain
as soon as is reasonably practicable all regulatory authorizations, consents,
orders or approvals from (i) the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the NCCOB and (ii)
any other approvals set forth in _Section 3.6(a)_ and _Section 5.9_ which are
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the merger and the Bank Merger or those the failure of which to be
obtained would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation
(collectively, the " _Required Regulatory Approvals_ ").

  



  

   

11

2.9 _Press Releases_. Prior to the Closing Date, BNC and HPBC
must each approve the form, substance and timing of any press release or
other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this
_Section 2.9_ shall be deemed to prohibit any party from making any disclosure
which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such
party's disclosure obligations imposed by law.

  



  

2.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing Date, BNC shall provide generally to
employees of HPBC who continue employment with BNC (" _HPBC
Continuing Employees_ ") medical, dental, vacation and long-term disability
benefits, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts and life
insurance (collectively, " _Employee Benefits_ "), on terms and conditions
consistent in all material respects with those then currently provided by BNC
to its other similarly-situated employees. For purposes of eligibility to
participate and any vesting or benefits determinations (but not benefit
accruals, except for accruals under the Executive Arrangements) in connection
with the provision of any such Employee Benefits by BNC to the HPBC Continuing
Employees, service with HPBC prior to the Closing Date shall be counted to
the extent such service was counted under the similar plan of HPBC. The HPBC
Continuing Employees' prior service with HPBC shall also be credited for
purposes of all waiting periods for participation in any of such Employee
Benefits to the extent such service was counted under the similar plan of
HPBC. BNC shall also waive all restrictions and limitations for preexisting
conditions under BNC's Employee Benefit plans, to the extent such restrictions
or limitations would not apply to the HPBC Continuing Employees under the
similar plan of HPBC.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable legal requirements, BNC and HPBC shall
take such other actions prior to the Closing Date as may be reasonably
necessary to enable the employees of HPBC after the Closing Date to transfer
the amount credited to their accounts under the HPBC 401(k) Plan (the " _HPBC
401(k) Plan_ "), including the portion of such accounts allocated to plan
loans, through a rollover contribution into the Bank of North Carolina 401(k)
Plan (the " _BNC 401(k) Plan_ "), if such employees are HPBC Continuing
Employees, or to transfer the amount credited to their accounts (not including
outstanding participant loans) through a rollover contribution to a separate
third party individual retirement account, or to take a cash
distribution from the HPBC 401(k) Plan, _provided, that_ (i) HPBC's Board of
Directors shall adopt resolutions to terminate the HPBC 401(k) Plan as of the
last payroll date ending prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the foregoing
shall be subject to the receipt of a final favorable IRS determination letter
(or prototype sponsor letter) with respect to the HPBC 401(k) Plan to the
extent reasonably required by BNC. For purposes of any vesting determinations
(but not benefit accruals) in connection with the BNC 401(k) Plan, service
with HPBC prior to the Closing Date shall be counted to the extent such
service was counted under the HPBC 401(k) Plan. For purposes of eligibility
to participate in any matching contribution under the BNC 401(k) Plan, HPBC
Continuing Employees shall be eligible on terms and conditions consistent
with those then currently provided by BNC to its other similarly-
situated employees based on their employment date with BNC. Prior to the
Closing Date HPBC shall make any necessary employer contributions to the HPBC
401(k) Plan due such HPBC Continuing Employees for compensation paid by HPBC
prior to termination of the HPBC 401(k) Plan. At the request of BNC, HPBC
shall, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of any applicable plan or
agreement in existence as of the date hereof, take such commercially
reasonable actions prior to the Closing Date as are reasonably determined by
BNC to be reasonably necessary to (i) correct or remedy any HPBC Plan that is
not in compliance with the provisions of ERISA, the Code (other than Section
409A of the Code, which is covered in the following clause (ii)) or other
applicable law, (ii) amend any HPBC Plan that is subject to Section 409A of
the Code and not in compliance therewith to comply with the applicable
requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and (iii) include provisions in the
Executive Arrangements that provide that there will not be any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code being
made in connection with the consummation of the transactions pursuant to the
Executive Arrangements that are the subject of this Agreement or any events
related thereto. To the extent that HPBC and the Bank have not filed their
final tax return for the 2015 fiscal year prior to the Closing Date, BNC and
Bank of NC shall take all actions required to complete any corrections made
pursuant to Internal Revenue Service Notice 2010-6 to the 2005 Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan of High Point Bank and Trust, as amended and
restated effective January 1, 2009.

(c) Subject to applicable legal requirements, BNC and HPBC shall
take such other commercially reasonable actions prior to the Closing Date as
may be necessary to terminate the agreements marked with an "*" on _Section
3.5(b)(i)_ of the Disclosure Memorandum effective as of the Closing Date. In
connection with such terminations, any compensation to be provided
thereunder, other than pursuant to the Executive Arrangements, shall be paid
in full in exchange for a settlement and release agreement
reasonably acceptable to BNC.

  



  

(d) BNC shall assume and perform in full any and all obligations of
HPBC, the Bank and any of their affiliates under the Executive
Arrangements and BNC shall administer the Executive Arrangements in
compliance with all applicable laws, including the Code. The term "
_Executive Arrangements_ " shall mean the plans and agreements set forth in
_Schedule 2.10(d)_. Bank of NC and BNC shall treat the Merger as a "Change in
Control" (or such similar term) for purposes of the Executive Arrangements.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, HPBC shall take all such actions, as
are necessary and appropriate, to freeze, effective as of the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date, the High Point Bank and Trust Company
Pension Plan (the " _Pension Plan_ ") and the 2005 Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan of High Point Bank and Trust Company, as amended and restated
effective January 1, 2009, and as subsequently amended (the " _2005 SERP_ "),
so that no further benefits shall accrue on and after the Closing Date under
such Pension Plan and the 2005 SERP. HPBC shall provide to BNC, prior to the
Closing Date, evidence that all such necessary and appropriate actions have
been taken, including without limitation the adoption by HPBC's board of
directors of appropriate resolutions to cease any further benefit accruals
under such Pension Plan and the 2005 SERP on and after such date (the form
and substance of such resolutions to be reviewed and approved by BNC prior to
their adoption by the HPBC board of directors). As soon as administratively
practicable after the Closing Date, BNC intends to take all such actions as
are necessary and appropriate to terminate the Pension Plan.

  



  

2.11 _Directors and Officers, Severance and Conversion Bonus Plan_.

  



  

(a) BNC shall take all appropriate action so that, as of the
Effective Time, the number of directors constituting the board of
directors of BNC and Bank of NC shall be increased by one and that, effective
immediately after the Closing Date, Matthew W. McInnis shall be appointed to
the boards of directors of BNC and Bank of NC.

  



  

(b) BNC agrees that it shall provide a severance package for all
HPBC employees with a minimum employment period with HPBC of twelve
(12) weeks and who are not retained by BNC following the Closing Date, or who
are otherwise displaced by BNC following the Closing Date. Such severance
package will be in accordance with BNC's existing policies and practices as
they apply to similarly-situated employees of BNC; _provided_ , _however_ ,
such severance package shall not include the cost of continuing healthcare
coverage.

  



  

   

13 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) To facilitate the successful integration of HPBC into BNC and
the conversion of the systems of HPBC and BNC, BNC shall establish a stay
bonus/conversion bonus plan pursuant to which displaced HPBC employees that
remain employed by BNC through the conversion of the systems of HPBC and BNC
receive an additional payment equal to a minimum of six (6) weeks of salary.

  



  

2.12 _Directors ' and Officers' Tail Coverage_. Prior to the
Closing Date, BNC shall have, at BNC's expense, amended, modified or obtained
directors' and officers' liability insurance (either through its existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies or under HPBC's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policies, in which
event HPBC will designate BNC's insurance broker as HPBC's broker-of-record,
as determined by BNC in its sole discretion) for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing Date, covering any person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, a
director or officer of HPBC or the Bank, who are currently covered by HPBC's
policies on terms similar to such existing insurance; _provided that_ BNC
shall not be obligated to make aggregate annual premium payments for such six
(6)-year period in respect of such policy which exceed two hundred
percent (200%) of the annual premium payments on HPBC's current policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the
amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, BNC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum
Amount. The directors and officers of HPBC and its subsidiaries shall take
all reasonable actions required by the insurance carrier necessary to procure
such endorsement.

  



  

2.13 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (or, in
the case of Claims that have not been resolved prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, until such Claims are finally
resolved), BNC shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the present and
former directors and executive officers of HPBC (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against all liabilities arising out of, resulting from or related
to any claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a
" _Claim_ "), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made,
a party or witness arising out of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or
was a director or officer of HPBC (or, at HPBC's request, was a director,
officer, manager or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another HPBC
entity or HPBC Plan) prior to the Effective Time if such Claim pertains to any
matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. BNC
shall promptly pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
in advance of the final disposition of any such Claim to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law upon receipt of an
undertaking to repay such advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated
not to be entitled to indemnification under this _Section 2.13(a)_. BNC shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall
have become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law (including any law promulgated, interpreted or enforced by any
regulatory authority).

  



  

   

14 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this _Section 2.13_ , upon learning of any such Claim, shall
promptly notify BNC thereof in writing (provided that a failure to timely
provide such notice shall not relieve BNC of any indemnification obligation
unless, and to the extent that, BNC is materially prejudiced by such failure).
In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) BNC shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
BNC shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if BNC elects not
to assume such defense for the Indemnified Parties, or if there are
substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between BNC and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and BNC shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ , that BNC shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section
2.13(b)_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for any Indemnified Party in any
jurisdiction; (ii) each Indemnified Party will cooperate in good faith in the
defense of any such Claim; (iii) BNC shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and (iv) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) BNC
shall not agree to any settlement which does not provide for a release of the
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) BNC covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any successors or
assigns, shall consolidate with or merge into any other person where BNC or
any such successor or assign shall not be the continuing or surviving person
of such consolidation or merger, or transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any person, unless, in each case, proper provision shall have been
made to ensure that the successors and assigns of BNC shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 2.13_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 2.13_ are intended to be for the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and legal and personal representatives.

  



  

2.14 _Certain Litigation_. Each party shall promptly advise the
other party orally and in writing of any actual or threatened shareholder
litigation against such party and/or the members of such party's board of
directors related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. HPBC shall: (i) permit BNC to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the view of BNC in connection
with, any proposed written or oral response to such shareholder
litigation; (ii) furnish BNC's outside legal counsel with all non-privileged
information and documents which outside legal counsel may reasonably request
in connection with such shareholder litigation; (iii) consult with BNC
regarding the defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation, (iv)
not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that HPBC shall not settle any such shareholder
litigation if such settlement requires the payment of money damages, without
the written consent of BNC (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld)
unless the payment of any such damages by HPBC is reasonably expected by
HPBC, following consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered
(disregarding any deductible to be paid by HPBC) under HPBC's existing
director and officer insurance policies, including any tail policy.

  



  

ARTICLE III _ 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HPBC_

  



  

As an inducement to BNC to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, HPBC represents and warrants as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Disclosure Memorandum_. HPBC has delivered to BNC a
memorandum (the " _Disclosure Memorandum_ ") containing certain information
regarding HPBC as indicated at various places in this Agreement. All
information set forth in the Disclosure Memorandum or in documents
incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Memorandum is true, correct and
complete, does not omit to state any fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, and shall be deemed for all purposes of
this Agreement to constitute part of the representations and warranties of
HPBC under this _Article III_. The information contained in the Disclosure
Memorandum shall be deemed to qualify all representations and warranties
contained in this _Article III_  and the covenants in _Article IV_ to the
extent applicable. No item is required to be set forth in the Disclosure
Memorandum as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence
would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed
untrue or incorrect; the mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure
Memorandum as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission by HPBC that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect; and any disclosures made with respect to a
section of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ shall qualify (i) any other section
of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ specifically referenced or cross-referenced
and (ii) other sections of _Article III_ or _Article IV_ to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections. HPBC shall promptly provide BNC
with written notification of any event, occurrence or other
information necessary to maintain the Disclosure Memorandum and all other
documents and writings furnished to BNC pursuant to this Agreement as true,
correct and complete at all times prior to and including the Closing.

thereby. Assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of BNC, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of HPBC,

relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other laws
affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally or (ii) the rules
governing the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other

securities or debt, of HPBC, which have been purchased or redeemed by HPBC
have been purchased or redeemed in accordance with all applicable federal,
state and local laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation,
all federal and state securities laws, and no such purchase or redemption has
resulted or will, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, result
in a default or acceleration of the maturity of, or otherwise modify, any
agreement, note, mortgage, bond, security agreement, loan agreement or other
contract or commitment of HPBC, which, singularly or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(f) _Tax Returns; Taxes_.

  



  

(i) Each of HPBC and the Bank has (i) duly and timely filed with the
appropriate governmental entity all Tax Returns required to be filed by it
(taking into account any applicable extensions), and all such Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete in all material respects and prepared in
compliance with all applicable laws and (ii) timely paid all material Taxes
due and owing (whether or not shown due on any Tax Returns). Neither HPBC nor
the Bank currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by a governmental
entity in a jurisdiction where HPBC and the Bank do not file Tax Returns that
HPBC or the Bank is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
Neither HPBC nor the Bank has commenced activities in any jurisdiction which
will result in an initial filing of a Tax Return with respect to Taxes imposed
by a governmental entity that it had not previously been required to file in
the immediately preceding taxable period.

  



  

(ii) The unpaid Taxes of HPBC and the Bank (A) did not, as of
December 31, 2014, exceed the reserve for Tax liabilities (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than
in any notes thereto) contained in the HPBC Financial Statements, and (B) do
not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of HPBC and the
Bank in filing their tax returns. Since December 31, 2014, neither HPBC nor
the Bank has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of
business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

  



  

(iii) There are no liens, charges, restrictions, encumbrances or
claims of any kind (collectively, " _Liens_ ") for Taxes upon any property or
asset of HPBC or the Bank, except for Liens for current Taxes the payment of
which is not yet delinquent, or for Taxes contested in good faith through
appropriate proceedings and reserved against in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(iv) There are no deficiencies for Taxes with respect to HPBC and the
Bank that have been set forth or claimed in writing, or proposed or assessed
by a governmental entity with respect to any Taxes due by, Tax Returns of, or
any of the assets or properties of HPBC or the Bank. There are no pending,
proposed or threatened audits, investigations, disputes or claims or other
actions for or relating to any Tax Return or liability for Taxes with respect
to HPBC and the Bank. No material issues relating to Taxes of HPBC or
the Bank were raised by the relevant governmental entity in any completed
audit or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur in a later
taxable period. None of HPBC, the Bank or any predecessor has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment, deficiency, or collection, or has made any
request in writing for any such extension or waiver, that remains in effect.
There is not currently in effect any power of attorney authorizing any Person
to act on behalf of HPBC or the Bank, or receive information relating to HPBC
or the Bank, with respect to any Tax matter.

  



  

(v) Neither HPBC nor the Bank has requested or received any ruling
from any governmental entity, or signed any binding agreement with any
governmental entity (including, without limitation, any advance pricing
agreement) that would affect any amount of Tax payable after the Closing Date
and has not made any request for issuance of a ruling from a governmental
entity on behalf of the HPBC or the Bank (regardless of whether the requested
ruling is still pending or withdrawn).

  



  

   

19 
--- 

 



    



  

(vi) Each of HPBC and the Bank has withheld and paid all Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or
other third party, and all Tax Returns (including without limitation all IRS
Forms W-2 and 1099) required with respect thereto have been properly completed
and timely filed with, and supplied to, the appropriate parties.

  



  

(vii) Except for any such customary agreements with customers, vendors,
lenders, lessors or the like entered into in the ordinary course of business
(each of which is not specifically entered into to address Taxes), neither
HPBC nor the Bank is a party to or bound by or has any obligation under any
Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or similar contract or
arrangement or any agreement that obligates it to make any payment computed
by reference to the Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses of any
other Person, other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among HPBC and its subsidiaries.

  



  

(viii) Except for the affiliated group of which HPBC is the common
parent, each of HPBC and the Bank is not and has never been a member of
an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
Code or any group that has filed a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax
Return. Neither HPBC nor the Bank is liable for the Taxes of any Person
(including an individual, corporation, general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, labor union or other entity or governmental entity) other than
HPBC and its subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee
or successor, (iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.

  



  

(ix) During the two-year period ending on the date hereof, neither
HPBC nor the Bank has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code.

  



  

(x) Neither HPBC nor the Bank has taken any action, failed to take
any action, or knows of any fact that would be reasonably expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(xi) Neither HPBC nor the Bank has been a party to a "reportable
transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) (other than such transactions that have been properly
reported) or any other transaction requiring disclosure under analogous
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law.

beneficiaries, including, without limitation, any post-retirement
life insurance, pension, profit sharing, stock option, retirement, bonus,

Plans_ "), and (ii) HPBC does not have any employment, severance, change in
control or similar agreements with any of its current or former employees,
officers, directors or independent contractors or their dependents or

separately any employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
"), sponsored, maintained or contributed to by HPBC or its ERISA Affiliates
or with respect to which HPBC or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability
(contingent or otherwise) (collectively, " _ERISA Plans_ "). True, correct
and complete copies of all ERISA Plans and, to the extent applicable, all
related trust agreements, insurance contracts, summary plan descriptions,
Internal Revenue Service determination letters and filings, the past three
(3) years of actuarial reports and valuations, annual reports and Form 5500
filings (including attachments) have been delivered to BNC.

  



  

(iii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(b)(iii)_ of the Disclosure
Memorandum, HPBC and its ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) are
not currently and have never in the past six years been required to
contribute to or had any liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to
(i) a multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37)(A) or 4001(a)(3) of

purposes of this _Section 3.5(b)(iii)_ , the term " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall
mean any person within the meaning of Section 3(9) of ERISA, or any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) that, together with HPBC, is treated
as a single employer within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

  



  

(iv) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(b)(iv)_ of the Disclosure
Memorandum, in all material respects, each HPBC Plan has been
established, operated and administered in accordance with its terms and in
accordance with, and has been amended to comply with (unless such amendment
is not yet required), all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including,
without limitation, ERISA, the Code, and the regulations issued under ERISA
and the Code. With respect to each HPBC Plan, other than routine claims for
benefits submitted in the ordinary course of the benefits process, no
litigation or administrative or other proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of HPBC, threatened involving such HPBC Plan or any of its
fiduciaries. With respect to each HPBC Plan, neither HPBC nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents or any fiduciary of any ERISA Plan
has been engaged in or been a party to any transaction relating to the HPBC
Plan which could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA or a " _prohibited transaction_ " (as such term is defined
in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), unless such transaction
is specifically permitted under Sections 407 or 408 of ERISA, Section 4975 of
the Code or a class or administrative exemption issued by the Department of
Labor. Each HPBC Plan that is a group health plan within the meaning of
Section 607(l) of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code is in material
compliance with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 501 of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code and other applicable laws.

(v) With respect to each HPBC Plan, all contributions or other
remittances required by such plan or applicable law have been made or will be
made on a timely basis.

  



  

(vi) Each HPBC Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code, and its related trust, respectively, has received a
favorable determination letter (or prototype sponsor letter) from the Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") as to the qualification of such plan and the tax-
exempt status of the related trust (or has filed with the IRS a request for
such a determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period
or is a prototype plan for which the prototype plan sponsor has received a
favorable opinion letter or advisory opinion from the IRS as to the
qualification of the prototype plan on which HPBC may rely) and no event has
occurred, and no condition exists, that would reasonably be expected to cause
the loss of such qualified or tax exempt status or the imposition of any
liability, tax or penalty under ERISA or the Code.

  



  

(vii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(b)(vii)_ of the Disclosure
Memorandum, HPBC does not provide and has no obligation to provide benefits,
including, without limitation, death, health, post-retirement life insurance

former employees of HPBC beyond their retirement or other termination of
service with HPBC other than: (i) coverage mandated by applicable law; or
(ii) benefits under the HPBC 401(k) Plan.

  



  

(viii) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(b)(viii)_ of the Disclosure
Memorandum, neither this Agreement nor any transaction contemplated hereby
(either alone or in combination with any other event will: (i) entitle any

unemployment compensation or any similar or other payment; (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting of, or increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due any such employee, officer or director; (iii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any HPBC Plan; or (iv) cause the payment of

Memorandum, each HPBC Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been maintained in written form, and administered and operated in compliance
in all material respects, with Section 409A and the regulations and rulings
thereunder.

  



  

(x) There is no audit or investigation pending with respect to any
HPBC Plan before any governmental authority and, to the knowledge of HPBC, no

(xi) HPBC has properly accrued on its financial statements in all
material respects, the correct number of days, for all vacation, sick
leave, personal time and paid time off credited to HPBC employees and
individual consultants as of the date of such financial statements. HPBC has,
for each HPBC Plan and all other purposes, correctly classified all natural
persons and, if applicable, their disregarded entities, providing services to
HPBC as common law employees or independent contractors as appropriate.

  



  

(xii) Except for amendments to the Executive Arrangements entered into
before the date of this Agreement, HPBC has not entered into any
commitment to modify or amend any HPBC Plan (other than in the ordinary
course and consistent with past practices or as required by law) nor to
establish any new benefit plan, program or arrangement. There has been no
amendment to any HPBC Plan, interpretation or announcement by HPBC relating
to any HPBC Plan or written notice or arrangement, or change in eligibility,
participation or coverage under any HPBC Plan, that would increase the
expense of maintaining any such HPBC Plan above the level of expense incurred
or with respect to such HPBC Plan for the most-recently completed fiscal year
of HPBC.

  



  

(xiii) Each pension plan, within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA,
that is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is
exempt from Parts 2, 3 and 4 of ERISA as an unfunded plan that is maintained
primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select
group of management or highly compensated employees pursuant to Sections
201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

  



  

(c) _Employment and Labor Matters_. HPBC is not, and has not been,
a party to any collective bargaining agreement or agreement of any kind with
any union or labor organization or to any agreement with any of its employees
which is not terminable at will or upon ninety (90) days' notice at the
election of, and without cost or penalty to, HPBC. HPBC has not received at
any time in the past five (5) years, any demand for recognition from any
union, and no attempt has been made, to organize any of its employees.
HPBC has complied in all material respects with all obligations under the
National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and local labor laws
and regulations applicable to employees. Except as described in _Section
3.5(c)_ of the Disclosure Memorandum, (i) there are no unfair labor practice
charges pending or, to the knowledge of HPBC, threatened against HPBC, and
(ii) there are, and in the past three (3) years there have been, no charges,
complaints, claims or proceedings, pending, or to the knowledge of HPBC,
threatened against, or involving, as the case may be, HPBC with respect to
any alleged violation of any wage and hour laws, age discrimination act laws,
employment discrimination laws or any other claims arising out of any
employment relationship as to any of HPBC's employees or as to any person
seeking employment therefrom, and no such violations exist. All employees and
independent contractors of HPBC are properly classified as such for all
purposes, including without limitation, the HPBC Plans.

  



  

(d) _Related Party Transactions_. Except for: (i) loans and
extensions of credit made on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions by HPBC with other Persons who are not affiliated with HPBC, and
which do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other
unfavorable features; (ii) deposits, all of which are on terms and conditions
identical to those made available to all customers of HPBC at the time such
deposits were entered into; and (iii) transactions specifically described in
_Section 3.5(d)_ of the Disclosure Memorandum, there are no contracts with or
commitments to present or former five percent (5%) or greater shareholders,
directors, officers, or employees involving the expenditure of more than
$60,000 as to any one individual, including with respect to any business
directly or indirectly controlled by any such Person, or $100,000 for all
such contracts or commitments in the aggregate for all such individuals
(other than contracts or commitments relating to services to be performed by

ARTICLE V _ 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BNC_

  



  

As an inducement to HPBC to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, BNC represents, warrants, covenants and
agrees as follows:

  



  

5.1 _Corporate and Financial_.

  



  

(a) _Corporate Status_. BNC is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
North Carolina. BNC has all of the requisite corporate power and authority
and is entitled to own or lease its properties and to carry on its business
in the places where such properties are now owned, leased or operated and such
business is now conducted.

  



  

(b) _Authority; Enforceability_.

  



  

(i) Subject to the required regulatory approvals as stated in
_Section 3.6(a)_ , and the approval of the HPBC shareholders, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated or required in connection herewith will not, with
or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both:

  



  

(1) violate any provision of federal or state law applicable to BNC,
the violation of which could be reasonably expected to have an adverse effect
on the business, operations, properties, assets, financial condition or
prospects of BNC;

  



  

(2) violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws
of BNC;

  



  

(3) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or
termination of, or constitute a default under any instrument, license,
agreement, or commitment to which BNC is a party, which, singularly or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the
business, operations, properties, assets, financial condition or prospects of
BNC; or

  



  

(4) constitute a violation of any order, judgment or decree to which
BNC is a party, or by which BNC or any of its assets or properties are bound.

  



  

(ii) BNC has full power and authority to enter into and perform this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery, performance and terms of this Agreement by BNC and
the consummation by BNC of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly and validly approved by BNC, including all necessary action by
the board of directors of BNC. No other corporate proceedings are necessary
on the part of BNC to authorize the execution, delivery, and performance of
this Agreement by BNC and the consummation by BNC of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of HPBC, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of BNC, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
limited by the General Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

   

38

(c) BNC has maintained a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. No
changes have been made to BNC's internal control over financial reporting, as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the 1934 Act, since December
31, 2014 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

  



  

5.2 _Disclosure Reports_. BNC has a class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act. BNC's (a) Annual Report
on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014; (b) Proxy Statement
for its 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders; (c) Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30,
2015; and (d) other reports filed by BNC pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act since December 31, 2014 (collectively, the " _BNC SEC
Reports_ "), taken together, correctly describe, among other things, the
business, operations and principal properties of BNC in accordance with the
requirements of the applicable report forms of the SEC. As of the respective
dates of filing (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such amended or superseded
filing), none of the BNC SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

5.3 _Absence of Changes_. Since December 31, 2014, there has been
no change in the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of BNC, or in any of its relationships with customers,
employees, lessors or others, other than changes in the ordinary course of
business, none of which individually or in the aggregate has had, or which
would reasonably be expected to have, an adverse effect on the business,
operations or financial condition of BNC on a consolidated basis.

  



  

5.4 _Legal Proceedings_. Neither BNC nor any of its subsidiaries
is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to BNC's knowledge,
threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against
BNC or any of its subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than regularly scheduled
examinations and similar routine investigations made by bank regulatory
officials in the course of their supervision of BNC or any of its
subsidiaries. There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or
material regulatory restriction imposed upon BNC, any of its subsidiaries or
the assets of BNC or any of its subsidiaries.

  



  

5.5 _Regulatory Reports_. BNC has made available to HPBC for
review and inspection the year-end and quarterly Reports of Condition and
Income filed by the Bank of NC with the FDIC and the Forms F.R. Y-6 and F.R.
Y-9SP filed by BNC with the Federal Reserve for or during each of the three
(3) years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the two (2) quarters
ended June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015, together with all such other reports
filed by BNC and the Bank of NC for or during the same three-year period with
the NCCOB, if any, and with any other applicable regulatory or governmental
agencies (collectively, the " _BNC Reports_ "). All of the BNC Reports have
been prepared in accordance with applicable rules and regulations applied on
a basis consistent with prior periods and contain all information required to
be presented therein in accordance with such rules and regulations.

5.6 _Enforcement Actions_. Neither BNC nor any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any Regulatory Agreement that restricts
the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its capital
adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business, nor has BNC or
any of its subsidiaries been advised by the Federal Reserve, NCCOB, or any
other applicable regulatory or governmental agency that it is considering
issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement.

  



  

5.7 _CRA, Anti-Money-Laundering and Customer Information
Security_. Other than investments to satisfy regulatory
requirements, neither BNC nor Bank of NC is a party to any agreement with any
individual or group regarding Community Reinvestment Act matters and, to its
knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist, which would cause Bank of NC: (i)
to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance with the Community
Reinvestment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be
assigned a rating for Community Reinvestment Act purposes by federal or state
bank regulators of lower than "satisfactory"; (ii) to be deemed to
be operating in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing
regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 103), the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with
respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money
laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in
satisfactory compliance with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and
regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the
provisions of the information security program adopted by Bank of NC pursuant
to 12 C.F.R. Part 364, except where the failure to be in such compliance
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BNC.
Furthermore, the board of directors of Bank of NC has adopted and Bank of NC
has implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate
and appropriate customer identification verification procedures that has not
been deemed ineffective by any governmental agency and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act.

  



  

5.8 _Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by BNC in this _Article V_ , neither BNC
nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to BNC, its subsidiaries, or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, and BNC hereby disclaims any such other representations or
warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither
BNC nor any other person makes or has made any representation or warranty to
HPBC or any of its affiliates or representatives with respect to (i) any
financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospective information
relating to BNC, any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses, or
(ii) except for the representations and warranties made by BNC in this
_Article V_ , any oral or written information presented to HPBC or any of its
affiliates or representatives in the course of their due diligence
investigation of BNC, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of
the transactions contemplated hereby. BNC acknowledges and agrees that
neither HPBC nor any other person has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty other than those contained in _Article III_.

  



  

5.9 _Other Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Act Filings; Securities Offerings_. BNC has timely
filed all forms, proxy statements, reports, schedules and other
documents, including all certifications and statements required by the 1934
Act or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required to be filed by the 1934
Act since January 1, 2014 (the " _BNC Exchange Act Reports_ "). BNC Exchange
Act Reports (i) at the time filed, (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
filing) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the securities laws and other applicable laws and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in
such BNC Exchange Act Reports or necessary to make the statements in such BNC
Exchange Act Reports, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each offering or sale of securities by BNC (i) was
either registered under the 1933 Act or made pursuant to a valid exemption
from registration, (ii) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the securities laws and other applicable laws, except for
immaterial late "blue sky" filings, including disclosure and broker/dealer
registration requirements, and (iii) was made pursuant to offering documents
which did not, at the time of the offering (or, in the case of registration
statements, at the effective date thereof) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in the
offering documents or necessary to make the statements in such documents, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) _Approvals, Consents and Filings_. Except for the Federal

this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby will: (i) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any governmental or regulatory
authority; or (ii) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule
or regulation applicable to BNC, or any of BNC's assets. BNC has no knowledge
of any fact or condition that would prevent or material impede or delay BNC
and HPBC from obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals.

  



  

(c) _Absence of Brokers_. Except for Banks Street Partners, LLC,
which has provided financial advisory services to BNC, no broker, finder or
other financial consultant has acted on BNC's behalf in connection with this
