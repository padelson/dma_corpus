without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (&#147;<U>Qualifying Income</U>&#148;), as determined by

a subsequent letter from the Company&#146;s accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Company, or (ii)&nbsp;a letter from the Company&#146;s counsel
indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Company Expenses would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code (or alternatively, the Company&#146;s outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Company with respect to the qualification
