forty-five (45) days following the submission to it of the Disputed Matters:

Matters in accordance with the Agreement, including Clause 3. The Experts
decision on the Disputed Matters must be within the range of values proposed

make an independent estimate on the basis of what he considers to be fair and
reasonable under the Agreement and consistent with the Accounting Principles.

the parties, its determination will be deemed to be equal to the value
proposed by the party which was closest to such determination. The Expert is
not authorised to decide on any legal dispute concerning the interpretation
of the Agreement. Any such dispute must be resolved in accordance with Clause
14.8. Upon determination of the Disputed Matters, the Expert will prepare a

Disputed Matters (but without making any changes to any elements of the
calculation of the Purchase Price which were not Disputed Matters).

Expert will be final and binding on the parties, and it can only be challenged

partys calculation of the Purchase Price deviated from the Purchase Price
determined by such party. 
---|---|--- 



   7.5 | No later than five (5) Business Days after the calculation of the
Purchase Price has become final and binding on the parties in accordance with
this Clause 7, the Adjustment Amount (together with the interest accrued on
the Adjustment Amount at the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date up to and
including the date of payment) must be paid in immediately available funds by
the Seller to the Purchaser, or by the Purchaser to the Seller (as
applicable), provided that: 
---|--- 



     | 7.5.1 | if the Adjustment Amount shall be paid by the Purchaser to
the Seller, 10 per cent of the Adjustment Amount shall be paid by the
Purchaser into the Escrow Account and the payment of the remainder of the
Adjustment Amount to the Seller shall fully discharge the Purchasers

last items claimed for any taxable year.

 



27 ---|---

---|--- 



     | 11.10.1 | Contingent Liabilities

(in whole or in part) in respect of the liability or Loss which is the subject
of a claim, the Purchaser or relevant member of the Purchaser Group shall pay

amount recovered from the third party (net of Taxation and less any costs of
recovery, including any actual increase in insurance premiums resulting from a
claim).

under this Agreement is a result of or in connection with a claim by or

   12.1 | No Admissions 
---|--- 

No admissions in relation to such third party claim shall be made by or on
behalf of the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group and the
claim shall not be compromised, disposed of or settled without the written
consent of the Seller if, in each case, such admission, compromise,
disposition or settlement would result in injunctive or other equitable relief

does not expressly and unconditionally release the Seller from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim;



   12.2 | Right to Participate in Defense of Claims

discretion, by notice in writing to the Purchaser, to participate in the

to employees of the Purchaser or the relevant Subsidiary of the Purchaser or
any other relevant member of the Purchasers Group relating to such
matters within the control of the Purchaser; provided that (a) the
participation by such Seller shall be without prejudice to the rights of the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group to deal with such matter and
(b) the Purchasers Group shall in any event control the defense of such
matters and shall have sole final authority in respect of such matters,
subject to the Sellers consent rights set forth in Clause 12. The Purchaser
shall in any event keep the Seller informed as to the steps which are being
taken in connection with the third party claim; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 12, the Purchaser
shall not be required to do anything which could adversely impact the legal
and/or litigation privilege in respect of any information relating to such
matter; provided that the failure to so inform the Seller shall not relieve
the Seller of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only
to the extent that) the Seller has been prejudiced thereby;



   12.3 | Investigation by the Seller 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall allow, and shall procure that the relevant Group Company

reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement or any Schedule or Exhibit hereto, and all provisions of this

capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement.
Each defined term used in this Agreement shall have a comparable meaning when
used in its plural or singular form. The use of the word "including" (or
definitions thereof) herein shall mean "including without limitation" and,

"or" shall not be exclusive. The parties hereto intend that each warranty and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
