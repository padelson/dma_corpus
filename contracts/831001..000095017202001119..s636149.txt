                  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
May 21, 2002, by and among CITIGROUP INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
GOLDEN STATE BANCORP INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and MERCURY
MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub").

                  WHEREAS, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire
to enter into a transaction whereby the Company will merge with and into
Merger Sub (the "Merger"), with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(d));

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have each approved this Agreement and the Merger
(as defined below) in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL") and determined that the Merger is advisable, and
Parent has adopted this Agreement and the Merger as the parent of Merger Sub;

                  WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
and as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Securityholders
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Securityholders Agreement"),
providing, among other things, that such stockholders will vote, or cause to
be voted, at the meeting of the Company's stockholders to be called for the
purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by them (except as
otherwise provided in such Securityholders Agreement) in favor of the Merger;
and

                  WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and that this Agreement be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

                                  THE MERGER

         SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Company
shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"), shall become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and
shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of the Company
in accordance with the DGCL.

         SECTION 1.2 Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of
the conditions to closing contained in Article VI hereof, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 4:00 p.m. on a date to be specified
by the parties (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto.
The Closing will be held at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP ("Skadden Arps"), Four Times Square, New York, New York 10036 or at
such other location as is agreed to by the parties hereto.

         SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effectuate the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such subsequent date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

         SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

         SECTION 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. The certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate
of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except that the
name of the Merger Sub shall be amended as of the Effective Time to a name
designated by Parent prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting.

         SECTION 1.6 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub
shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected,
appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company shall, from and after the
Effective Time, become the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE II

                   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
                       OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
                           EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         SECTION 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:

         (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by the Company shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or a
subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub shall be converted pursuant to the Merger
as provided in Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.2. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(c)
and Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or a
subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into Parent Common Stock (as
defined below).

         (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of
this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled and
retired pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof and Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.5 hereof)) shall be converted, at the election of the holder
thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3 below and
subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.4, into the right to receive the following:

                  (i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to
         which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not
         revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.3 (a "Cash Election"), the
         right to receive in cash from Parent an amount equal to the Per Share
         Amount (as defined below) (the "Cash Consideration") (collectively,
         "Cash Election Shares");

                  (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to
         which an election to receive common stock, par value $.01 per share,
         of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") has been effectively made and not
         revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.3 (a "Stock Election"), the
         right to receive from Parent the fraction of a share of Parent Common
         Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the
         "Stock Consideration") (collectively, the "Stock Election Shares");
         and

                  (iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than
         shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been
         effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 2.3
         (collectively, "Non-Election Shares"), the right to receive from
         Parent such Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as is
         determined in accordance with Section 2.2(b).

         (d) Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

                  (i) "Aggregate Cash Amount" means 40% of the product of (x)
         the Aggregate Company Share Amount, less the number of outstanding
         shares of Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
         hereof (but excluding from such reduction the 16,433,269 treasury
         shares as of May 17, 2002 and treasury shares arising after May 17,
         2002 in connection with the exercise of Company Stock Options after
         May 17, 2002) and (y) $41.00; provided, however, that if, at the
         Effective Time, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
         Stock issuable upon exercise of then outstanding Company Stock
         Options (as defined below) exceeds the difference between (A)
         5,361,680 less (B) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
         Stock issued upon exercise of Company Stock Options after May 17,
         2002 and prior to the Effective Time (such excess being referred to
         herein as the "Excess Option Shares"), then the "Aggregate Cash
         Amount" shall be reduced by the product of (A) the Excess Option
         Shares and (B) an amount equal to the excess of $41.00 over the
         weighted average exercise price of the Excess Stock Options (if
         separately identifiable or, if not, the outstanding Company Stock
         Options) at the Effective Time.

                  (ii) "Aggregate Company Share Amount" shall equal
         136,041,431 shares of Company Common Stock; provided, however, that
         the Aggregate Company Share Amount shall be increased (A) by virtue
         of the issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock upon the
         exercise from and after May 17, 2002 and prior to the Effective Time
         of Company Stock Options outstanding on May 17, 2002 and (B) upon the
         issuance prior to the Effective Time of any shares of Company Common
         Stock (x) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or (b) of the 1998 Merger
         Agreement, or (y) to the extent contemplated by Section 6(c)(iii)(A)
         of the Securityholders Agreement, pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the
         1998 Merger Agreement or (z) pursuant to the terms of the LTWs, in
         each case on the basis of one additional share of Company Common
         Stock for each share so issued; provided, further, that the
         "Aggregate Company Share Amount" shall in no event exceed 146,773,293
         shares of Company Common Stock plus any shares of Company Common
         Stock issued prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the
         LTWs (as such term is defined is Section 2.6 of this Agreement) or
         pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or (b) of the 1998 Merger Agreement.

                  (iii) "Aggregate Parent Share Amount" shall be equal to
         71,204,085 shares of Parent Common Stock; provided, however, that the
         "Aggregate Parent Share Amount" shall be increased (x) by virtue of
         the issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock upon the exercise
         prior to the Effective Time of Company Stock Options outstanding on
         May 17, 2002 and (y) upon the issuance prior to the Effective Time of
         any shares of Company Common Stock issuable (x) pursuant to Section
         1.6(a) or (b) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, or (y) to the extent
         contemplated by Section 6(c)(iii)(A) of the Securityholders
         Agreement, pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement or
         (z) pursuant to the terms of the LTWs, and shall be decreased in the
         event any shares of Company Common Stock are cancelled pursuant to
         Section 2.1(b) hereof, other than the 16,433,269 treasury shares as

         SECTION 2.2 Proration.

         (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (the "Stock Conversion Number") shall
be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Aggregate Parent Share
Amount by (y) the Exchange Ratio. All of the other shares of Company Common
Stock shall be converted into Cash Consideration (in each case, excluding
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 2.1(b)
and Dissenting Shares).

         (b) Within five business days after the later to occur of the
Election Deadline or the Effective Time (as such terms are defined in Sections
2.3(d) and 1.3, respectively), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 2.3) to effect the allocation among holders of Company
Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration as follows:

                  (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
         Stock with respect to which a Stock Election shall have been made
         (the "Stock Election Number") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number,
         then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each
         holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
         Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof
         (other than Stock Election Shares held by the Ford Parties, all of
         which shall be converted into Stock Consideration) will be converted
         into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that
         number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
         multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such
         holder (other than the Ford Parties) by (y) a fraction, the numerator
         of which is the Stock Conversion Number less the number of Stock
         Election Shares held by the Ford Parties and the denominator of which
         is the Stock Election Number less the number of Stock Election Shares
         held by the Ford Parties, with the remaining number of such holder's
         Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
         Cash Consideration; and

                  (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock
         Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number
         exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the
         "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be
         converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the
         Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the
         following manner:

                  (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the
            number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall
            be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and
            Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the
            right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number
            of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
            multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such
            holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall
            Number and the denominator of which is the total number of
            Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's
            Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the
            Cash Consideration; or

                  (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of
            Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be
            converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and
            Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the
            right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number
            of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
            multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
            holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by
            which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of
            Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total
            number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such
            holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
            receive the Cash Consideration.

         SECTION 2.3 Election and Exchange Procedures. Each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) ("Holder")
shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II,
to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:

         (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section (herein called an "Election") (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Cash Election.

         (b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Form of Election") which shall be mailed to the Company's stockholders
entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting so as to permit the
Company's stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to
the Election Deadline (as defined in subsection (d)).

         (c) Parent shall make the Form of Election initially available at the
time that the Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is made available to the
stockholders of the Company, to such stockholders, and shall use all
reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of
Election to any stockholder of the Company who requests such Form of Election
following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the
Election Deadline. In no event shall the Form of Election be made available
less than twenty (20) days prior to the Election Deadline.

         (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person
authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this
Agreement, which person shall be designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), shall have received, by 5:00
p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such Exchange
Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates of the shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") to which such Form of
Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such
certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any
registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company
in the United States; provided, that such certificates are in fact delivered
to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery.
Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee
of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined
by Parent, in its sole discretion. As used herein, "Election Deadline" means
5:00 p.m. on the date that is the day prior to the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to issue a press
release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at
least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline.

         (e) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed, revised Form of Election. If Parent shall determine in
its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect
to any shares of Company Common Stock, such Election shall be deemed to be not
in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election
shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a
proper Election is thereafter timely made.

         (f) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate, or of the guarantee
of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange
Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Article VII.

         (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
person other than the person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such
Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in Section
3.1(j)) required as a result of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is not payable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent the amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

         (h) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If after the Effective Time,
Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

         (i) At any time following the nine month anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it
any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not distributed to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock that was deposited with the Exchange Agent
at the Effective Time (the "Exchange Fund") (including any interest received
with respect thereto and other income resulting from investments by the
Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock payable upon due surrender of their Company
Stock Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Company Stock Certificate for Merger Consideration (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each
case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

         (j) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates.

         (k) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (l)
below, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid by Parent to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until
the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with subsection
(l) below. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate there
shall be paid to the holder of a certificate for Parent Common Stock (a
"Parent Stock Certificate") representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
subsection (l), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes, if
necessary.

         (l) No Parent Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Stock Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of Parent.
In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of a Company Stock
Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional
share interest in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate shall receive
from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at
the Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Closing Parent
Share Value.

         (m) Parent shall have the right to make all determinations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of
the Forms of Election and compliance by any Company Stockholder with the
Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the manner and extent to which
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed
by Section 2.3, (C) the issuance and delivery of Parent Stock Certificates
into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (D)
the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock where the holder of the applicable
Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

         (n) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay in a timely manner, and the Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Stock
Consideration. In addition, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent
on a daily basis sufficient cash to permit prompt payment of the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to
receive whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

         (o) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock
Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor who did not complete an Election Form, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
such certificates) (the "Letter of Transmittal") to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange
Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
the Company Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.3(l) and any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(k).

         (p) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Company Stock
Certificate or Company Stock Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed
Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of Transmittal a holder of
Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective
Time the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to
Sections 2.1 and 2.2) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by its Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such
Company Stock Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.3(l) and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(k).

         SECTION 2.4 Certain Adjustments. If after the date hereof and on or
prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or combination, stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock,
or any similar event shall occur (any such action, an "Adjustment Event"), the
Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the
holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such Adjustment Event; provided, further, that, in the
case of an Adjustment Event in respect of the distribution of shares of
Travelers Property and Casualty Corp. capital stock to Parent's stockholders,
the Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall be adjusted by determining the value
of the distribution based on the NYSE methodology for setting the opening
trading price for shares of Parent Common Stock on the date that shares of
Parent Common Stock begin trading on an ex-dividend basis (which valuation
methodology is the same methodology that will be used in the anti-dilution
adjustments made to the outstanding employee stock options to purchase Parent
Common Stock).

         SECTION 2.5 Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock
that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by
a stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights under the DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect,
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the
Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to
the requirements of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed to
perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right after the Election
Deadline, each share of such holder's Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Stock Election
Consideration or the Cash Election Consideration or a combination thereof as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

         SECTION 2.6 Litigation Tracking Warrants. Following the Effective
Time, the outstanding litigation tracking warrants issued by the Company to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock and those held in tandem with stock
options outstanding under the Amended and Restated Golden State Bancorp Inc.
Stock Option and Long-Term Performance Incentive Plan, as amended (the
"LTWs"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent. Each LTW
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
applicable to such LTW immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that,
from and after the Effective Time, each LTW shall, when and if it becomes
exercisable in accordance with its terms, be exercisable in respect of Parent
Common Stock and cash in the same proportion that the holders of Company
Common Stock receive in the aggregate in the Merger as measured as of the
Effective Time. Parent shall be solely responsible for the issuance of Parent
Common Stock and the delivery of the cash amount upon such exercise. From and
after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall (A) assume all of the obligations
and obtain all of the rights of the Company under the Warrant Agreement and in
connection with the LTWs and (B) be solely responsible for the issuance of
Parent Common Stock and the delivery of the cash amount upon exercise of the
LTWs, and (ii) the Company shall have no further rights and obligations under
the Warrant Agreement and in connection with the LTWs.

         qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
         jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
         leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
         licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure
         to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing individually
         or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
         material adverse effect on the Company or the applicable subsidiary.

                  (ii) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent
         prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies
         of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or other

entities under applicable law (collectively, "Liens"); and (iii) are free of
any other material restriction (including any restriction on the right to

         an ERISA Affiliate is party, whether written or oral, for the benefit
         of any Employee or any director or former director of the Company or

         subsidiary of the Company relating to, or change in the Plan
         provisions relating to employee participation or coverage under, any
         Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
         Plan above the level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the
         most recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof, except as
         required by applicable law or previously disclosed contractual
         commitment as set forth in Section 3.1(k)(iii) of the Company
         Disclosure Schedule.

                  (iv) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate contributes
         to, or is obligated to contribute to, a "multiemployer pension plan,"
         as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA nor has the Company or any ERISA
         Affiliate, during the five year period prior to the date hereof been
         obligated, to contribute to such plan for which the Company or any of
         its subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any material
         liability.

                  (v) Neither the Company or any subsidiary of the Company,
         any Plan, any trust created thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of the
         Company, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
         transaction in connection with which the Company or any subsidiary of
         the Company, any Plan, any such trust, or any trustee or
         administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any Plan or any such
         trust could be subject to either any material civil penalty assessed
         pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a material tax imposed
         pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

                  (vi) Each Plan has been operated and administered in
         accordance with its terms and applicable law in all material
         respects, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

                  (vii) The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter
         with respect to each Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
         meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code that has not been revoked, and,
         to the knowledge of the Company no circumstances exist that could
         adversely affect the qualified status of any such plan and the
         exemption under Section 501(a) of the Code of the trust maintained
         thereunder. Each Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section
         501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such requirements in all material
         respects.

                  (viii) With respect to any plan subject to Title IV of
         ERISA, to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was
         required to make, contributions on behalf of any Employee or any
         director or former director during the five (5)-year period ending on
         the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the Closing
         Date, (a) no liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has
         been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
         satisfied in full, and (b) to the knowledge of the Company, no
         condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any
         ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than liability
         for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC")
         (which premiums have been paid when due).

                  (ix) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
         any Title IV Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition
         exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be
         instituted. With respect to each Title IV Plan, the present value of
         accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial
         assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
         report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect to such plan did
         not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current value
         of the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits. No
         Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
         "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA
         and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last
         day of the most recently ended fiscal year.

                  (x) No Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
         death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for Employees for
         periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of
         service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii)
         death benefits under any "pension plan," (iii) benefits the full cost
         of which is borne by the Employee (or his beneficiary) or (iv) Plans
         that can be amended or terminated by the Company without consent.

                  (xi) No material amounts payable under the Plans will fail
         to be deductible for Federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section
         162(m) of the Code.

         date hereof, of all written or oral loan agreements, notes or

         other than "non-accrual" Loans, and (B) the aggregate outstanding
         principal amount, as of April 30, 2002, of all "non-accrual" Loans.
         As of April 30, 2002, the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
         whole, did not have outstanding Loans and assets classified as "Other
         Real Estate Owned" with an aggregate then outstanding, fully
         committed principal amount in excess of $320,000,000, net of specific
         reserves with respect to such Loans and assets, that were designated
         by the Company as "Special Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful",
         "Loss", or words of similar import ("Criticized Assets"). Section
         3.1(x) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (A) a summary of
         Criticized Assets as of April 30, 2002, by category of Loan (e.g.,

                  (ii) Except as would not have a material adverse effect on
         the Company, each Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other
         evidences of indebtedness which are true, genuine and what they
         purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by valid
         liens and security interests which have been perfected and (iii) is
         the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
         enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
         insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general
         applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
         general equity principles. Except as would not have a material
         adverse effect on the Company, all Loans originated by the Company or
         its subsidiaries, and all such Loans purchased by the Company or its
         subsidiaries, were made or purchased in accordance with customary
         lending and leading standards of the Company or its subsidiaries, as
         applicable. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(x) of the Company
         Disclosure Schedule, all such Loans (and any related guarantees) and

         and clear of any Lien, and the Company or its subsidiaries has

         relating to such Loans.

         (y) Real Property.

                  (i) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has good title
         free and clear of all Liens to all real property (the "Owned
         Properties") owned by such entities, except for (i) Liens for taxes
         not yet due and payable or contested in good faith by appropriate
         proceedings, (ii) such imperfections of title, easements and
         encumbrances, if any, as do not interfere in any material respect
         with the use of the property as such property is used on the date of
         this Agreement or (iii) mechanics' materialmen's, workmen's,
         repairmen's, warehousemen's, carrier's and other similar Liens
         arising in the ordinary course of business.

                  (ii) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to
         which the Company or any of its subsidiaries leases any real property
         (such agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and
         other supplements thereto, collectively, the "Leases") has heretofore
         been made available to Parent. Each Lease is valid, binding and
         enforceable against the Company or its applicable subsidiary in
         accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect. There are
         no existing defaults by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as
         applicable, under any of the Leases which, in the aggregate, would
         result in the termination of such Leases and a material adverse
         effect on the Company. The consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the
         Leases which, in the aggregate, would result in a material adverse
         effect on the Company.

                  (iii) The Owned Properties and the properties (the "Leased
         Properties") leased pursuant to the Leases constitute all of the real
         estate within which the Company and its subsidiaries conduct their
         respective business operations as of the date of this Agreement,
         except for locations the loss of which would not constitute a
         material adverse effect on the Company. The Owned Properties and the
         Leased Properties are in compliance with all laws in all material
         respects, except for any lack of compliance which would not result in
         a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither any agreement
         relating to the Owned Properties nor any of the Leases requires
         consent of any third party for the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated hereby except for (i) such consents which will be
         obtained prior to Closing, and (ii) such consents which, if not
         obtained, will not, in the aggregate, result in a material adverse
         effect on the Company.

                  (iv) A true and complete copy of each agreement pursuant to
         which the Company or any of its subsidiaries leases real property to
         a third party (such agreements, together with any amendments,
         modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the "Third
         Party Leases") has heretofore been made available to Parent. Each
         Third Party Lease is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
         with its terms and is in full force and effect, except that (i) such
         enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
         other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors'
         rights generally and (ii) the availability of the remedy of specific
         performance or injunction or other forms of equitable relief may be
         subject to equitable defenses and would be subject to the discretion
         of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
         There are no existing defaults by the tenant under any Third Party
         Lease which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of
         such Third Party Leases and a material adverse effect on the Company.
         The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         will not cause defaults under the Third Party Leases which, in the
         aggregate, would result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

         SECTION 3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent. Except as set
forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") and making

         the SEC ("significant subsidiaries")) and Merger Sub is a corporation
         or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
         standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept)

         the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may be, and
         authority to carry on its business as now being conducted except, as
         to subsidiaries, for those jurisdictions where the failure to be duly
         organized, validly existing and in good standing, individually or in
         the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on Parent.
         Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
         do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
         nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
         properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
         for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
         licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
         would not have a material adverse effect on Parent.

                  (ii) Merger Sub is a newly formed corporation with no
         material assets or liabilities, except for liabilities arising under
         this Agreement. Merger Sub will not conduct any business or
         activities other than the issuance of its stock to Parent prior to

         contemplated hereby;

                  (xvii) pay, discharge, settle, compromise or satisfy any
         material claims, liabilities or obligations (absolute, accrued,
         asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise), including taking
         any action to settle or compromise any litigation, other than any
         such payment, discharge, settlement, compromise or satisfaction in
         the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or in
         accordance with their terms, of liabilities reflected or reserved
         against in, or contemplated by, the most recent consolidated
         financial statements (or the notes thereto) of the Company included
         in the Company Filed SEC Documents, or incurred since March 31, 2002
         in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

                  (xviii) authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the
         foregoing actions or any other action that would be reasonably likely
         to prevent the Company from performing or would be reasonably likely
         to cause the Company not to perform its covenants hereunder in all
         material respects;

                  (xix) issue any broadly distributed communication of a
         general nature to Employees (including general communications
         relating to benefits and compensation) or customers without the prior
         written approval of Parent (which will not be unreasonably delayed or
         withheld), except for communications in the ordinary course of
         business that do not relate to the Merger or other transactions
         contemplated hereby;

                  (xx) create, renew, amend or permit to expire, lapse or
         terminate or knowingly take any action reasonably likely to result in
         the creation, renewal, amendment, expiration, lapse or termination of
         any insurance policies referred to in Section 3.1(o), except that the
         Company shall be permitted to take any such action without Parent's
         consent in the event that Parent shall fail to reasonably consent to
         such action; or

                  (xxi) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take
         any action which would result in any of the conditions of Article VI
         not being satisfied.

         SECTION 4.2 Advice of Changes. Except to the extent prohibited by
applicable law or regulation, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent it has
knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it
to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement and (iii) any change or event having, or which, insofar as can
reasonably be foreseen, could have a material adverse effect on such party or
on the truth of their respective representations and warranties or the ability
of the conditions set forth in Article VI to be satisfied; provided, however,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
provided further that a failure to comply with this Section 4.2 shall not
constitute a failure to be satisfied of any condition set forth in Article VI
unless the underlying untruth, inaccuracy, failure to comply or satisfy, or
change or event would independently result in a failure to be satisfied of a
condition set forth in Article VI.

         SECTION 4.3 No Solicitation by the Company. (a) Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 4.3, until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
date of termination of this Agreement, neither the Company, nor any of its
subsidiaries or any of the officers, directors, agents, representatives or
affiliates of it or its subsidiaries (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) shall (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information),
or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making
of any proposal which constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined
below), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any
Company Takeover Proposal or (iv) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any Company Takeover Proposal. If
and only to the extent that (i) the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not
have occurred, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders
under applicable law, (iii) the Company's Board of Directors concludes in good
faith that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal (as defined below), (iv) such Company Takeover Proposal was not
solicited by it and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
4.3(a), and (v) the Company provides prior written notice to Parent of its
decision to take such action, the Company shall be permitted to (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and any of its subsidiaries to such
person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, (B) participate in
discussions and negotiations with such person, (C) subject to first complying
with the provisions of Section 5.8(b) hereof, enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement and (D) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation (as defined
below); provided, that at least five business days prior to taking any actions
set forth in clause (C) or (D) above, the Company's Board of Directors
provides Parent written notice advising Parent that the Company's Board of
Directors is prepared to conclude that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and during such five business day
period the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Company Takeover Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal and the Company's Board of Directors fully considers any
such adjustment and nonetheless concludes in good faith that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal. The Company, its
subsidiaries and their representatives immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 20% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of any equity
securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company whose business constitutes 20%
or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole), other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal"
means any proposal made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or
indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, sale,
lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including a contribution to a
joint venture), dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the combined voting power of the
shares of the Company's capital stock then outstanding or 100% of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and (B) which is otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with (i)
either Goldman Sachs & Co. or another nationally recognized investment banking
firm and (ii) outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal, that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a
transaction that is more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably
capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which
is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such
third party.

         (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.3, neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval of the Agreement, the
Merger or the Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or take
any action or make any statement in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting inconsistent with such approval or Company Recommendation
(collectively, a "Change in the Company Recommendation"), (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover
Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement
(each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") related to any Company Takeover
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company
Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public
proposal to approve or recommend), by the Company Board of a Company Takeover
Proposal, or any failure by the Company Board to recommend against a Company
Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of
the Company, to the extent that it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Company Superior
Proposal it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, may terminate this
Agreement solely in order to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to any Company Superior Proposal, but only at a time
that is after the fifth business day following Parent's receipt of the written
notice specified in Section 4.3(a) and compliance by the Company with the
terms of Sections 4.3(a) and 5.8(b).

         (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.3, the Company shall immediately
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information relating to
a Company Takeover Proposal, or of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request or Company Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person making such request or Company Takeover Proposal, and
shall promptly provide a copy of any written request or Company Takeover
Proposal to Parent. The Company will keep Parent promptly informed of the
status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or Company Takeover Proposal.

         (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would violate its
obligations under applicable law; provided, however, any such disclosure
relating to a Company Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in the
Company Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms
the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

         SECTION 4.4 Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its subsidiaries to: (i) timely file (taking into account any extensions of
time within which to file) all Tax Returns ("Post-Signing Returns") required
to be filed by it and such Post-Signing Returns shall be prepared in a manner
reasonably consistent with past practice; (ii) timely pay all Taxes shown as
due and payable on such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed; (iii) accrue a
reserve in its books and records and financial statements in accordance with
past practice for all Taxes payable by it for which no Post-Signing Return is
due prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) promptly notify Parent of any
material suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit
(collectively, "Actions") pending against or with respect to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter, including (without
limitation) Tax liabilities and refund claims.

         SECTION 4.5 Transition. Commencing following the date hereof, Parent
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, use
their reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of the Company and
its subsidiaries, including the Bank, with the businesses of Parent and its
subsidiaries to be effective as of the Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Closing Date and
consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations and the
continuous operation of the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business, the Company shall cause the employees and officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, to use their reasonable best
efforts to provide support, including support from its outside contractors,
and to assist Parent in performing all tasks, including, without limitation,
equipment installation, reasonably required to result in a successful
integration at the Closing.

         SECTION 4.6 No Fundamental Changes in the Conduct of Business by
Parent. Except as set forth in Section 4.6 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or except as
consented to by the Company in writing or required by applicable law or
regulation, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of it subsidiaries to:

                  (i) except as contemplated hereby, amend its certificate of
         incorporation or by-laws in a manner that would adversely affect the
         economic benefits of the Merger to the holders of Company Common
         Stock; provided that the authorization or issuance of preferred stock
         in a manner that would not require Parent stockholder approval shall
         not be deemed to violate this clause (i);

                  (ii) enter into any agreement to acquire all or
         substantially all of the capital stock or assets of any other person
         or business unless such transaction would not materially delay or
         impede the consummation of the Merger;

                  (iii) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take
         any action which would result in any of the conditions of Article VI
         not being satisfied;

                  (iv) authorize, or commit or agree to take, any of the
         foregoing actions or any other action that would be reasonably likely
         to prevent Parent from performing or would be reasonably likely to
         cause Parent not to perform its covenants hereunder in all material
         respects; or

                  (v) directly purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of
         Company Common Stock.

                                  ARTICLE V

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

                  SECTION 5.1 Preparation of the Form S-4, Proxy Statement;
         Stockholders Meeting.

         (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such
filing. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to holders of Company Common Stock as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective.

         (b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i)
any event with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with
respect to other information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with
respect to information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, in either case, which event is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement, to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, such
event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Company.

         (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate
government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other
appropriate government official for amendments or supplements to any of the
filings with the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby or for additional information and shall supply the other
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be,
on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government
official, on the other hand, with respect thereto. The Company and Parent
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and
provide to each other all information necessary in order to prepare the Form
S-4 and the Proxy Statement, and shall provide promptly to the other party any
information such party may obtain that could necessitate amending any such
document.

         (d) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the DGCL
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and subject to
Section 4.3, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to the
Company's stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.1(d) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
any Change in the Company Recommendation, unless otherwise directed in writing
by Parent, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of approving the Agreement and the Merger and nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

         (e) The Company shall coordinate and cooperate with Parent with
respect to the timing of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

         SECTION 5.2 Letters of the Company's Accountants. The Company shall
cause to be delivered to Parent two letters from the Company's independent
accountants, one dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the Form S-4 shall become effective and one dated a date within two
business days before the Closing Date, each addressed to Parent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

         SECTION 5.3 Letters of Parent's Accountants. Parent shall cause to be
delivered to the Company two letters from Parent's independent accountants,
one dated a date within two business days before the date on which the Form

reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance
for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

         SECTION 5.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to the
Agreement, dated as of April 4, 2002 (executed as of April 8, 2002) between
Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and subject to
applicable law, the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, afford
Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all its
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each material
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it with
any Governmental Entity and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request. In
addition, the Company will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent the
internal or external reports prepared by the Company and/or its subsidiaries
in the ordinary course that are reasonably required by Parent promptly after
such reports are made available to the Company's personnel. No review pursuant
to this Section 5.4 shall affect any representation or warranty given by the
Company to Parent. Parent will hold, and will cause its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives and
affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

         SECTION 5.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable
law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement.

         (b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that
no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

         (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to effect the
combination (the "Bank Combination") of the Bank with Citibank FSB, or another
banking subsidiary of Parent, including, without limitation, the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities (including the OTS Approval) and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (including the OTS Approval).

         (d) At the reasonable request of Parent, the Company and its
subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts and cooperate with Parent
in order to permit all of the indebtedness outstanding under the Indenture,
dated as of August 6, 1998, between Mercury State Holdings Inc. and The Bank
of New York, as trustee (including any amendments and supplemental indentures,
the "Indenture"), to be called for redemption and redeemed as promptly as
possible following the Closing. In furtherance thereof, the Company and its
subsidiaries agree to request that The Bank of New York consent to shorten the
notice period required pursuant to Section 3.02 of the Indenture from 60 days
to 30 days or agree to accept a redemption notice that is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger.

         SECTION 5.6 Company Equity-Based Incentives. (a) As of the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option representing a right to receive
Company Common Stock upon exercise of such Company Stock Option shall be
converted into an option (an "Adjusted Option") to purchase the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock) equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio, and references in each such option to the Company shall be
deemed to refer to Parent, where appropriate; provided, however, Parent shall
assume the obligations of the Company under the applicable Company Stock Plan
and agreements under which the Adjusted Option was originally granted, subject
to the adjustments required by this Section 5.6(a). The other terms of each
such Adjusted Option, and the plans under which they were issued, shall
continue to apply in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, with respect to the Company Stock Options
granted under the LTIP, (i) the rights with respect to LTWs attached to such
Company Stock Options shall continue in full force and effect following the
Effective Time, with such LTWs to be adjusted in accordance with Section 2.6
hereof, (ii) the exercise price of such Company Stock Options relating to such
LTWs shall be adjusted to include the adjusted LTW exercise price in lieu of
the current LTW exercise price and (iii) such Company Stock Options to be
subject to adjustment following the Effective Time in accordance with the
special LTW anti-dilution provision of the LTIP upon the exercise of any such
Company Stock Option on or after the Triggering Event (as defined in the
Warrant Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any Company
Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, the
conversion formula shall be adjusted if necessary to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code.

         (b) The Company shall adopt such resolutions and take all such other
actions as may be required to permit the transactions contemplated by this
Section 5.6, including, but not limited to the conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock held or to be awarded or paid pursuant to such benefit plans,
programs or arrangements into shares of Parent Common Stock on a basis
consistent with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (c) Parent shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that will become subject to the plans referred to in this
Section 5.6 and (ii) issue or cause to be issued the appropriate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to applicable plans upon the exercise
or maturation of rights existing thereunder on the Effective Time or
thereafter granted or awarded. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parent's obligations under this Section 5.6.

         (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting
forth such holders' rights pursuant to awards granted under the Company Stock
Plans.

         (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article I and II or Section 5.6 of this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or by each individual,
if any, who will be so subject, immediately following the Effective Time, with
respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom LLP.

         SECTION 5.7 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any existing
indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or their respective predecessors or (ii) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto
agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto.

         (c) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Company's
directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of Parent or its subsidiaries (including self
insurance) containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable to such directors or officers; provided, further, that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums for
insurance under this Section 5.7(c) in excess of 200% of the aggregate
premiums paid by the Company in 2001 on an annualized basis for such purpose
and, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

         (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any successor
thereto, whether by consolidation, merger or transfer of substantially all of
its properties or assets, to comply with its obligations under this Section
5.7. The provisions of this Section 5.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and other person named herein and his or her heirs and
representatives.

         SECTION 5.8 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in this Section
5.8 or in Section 5.14, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated. Subject to Section 5.14, the Company shall not become
or agree to become liable for any fees and expenses related to work performed
on behalf of its major stockholders.

         (b) (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii), then, upon such termination, the Company shall
pay Parent a fee equal to $117,500,000 by wire transfer of same day funds
within two business days after such termination; furthermore, if, prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination the Company
consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or enters into a Company Acquisition
Agreement (provided that, for purposes of this Section 5.8(b)(i), the
percentage referred to in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be
50% or more and any reference in such definition to any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or substantially similar transaction
involving the Company shall mean any such transaction in which the
stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction, as a group,
own less than a majority of the outstanding common stock or other ownership
interests of the Company or the surviving or resulting corporation in such
transaction or, as applicable, the publicly traded parent corporation thereof,
immediately following such transaction (and shall not include any such
transaction solely with a wholly owned subsidiary and not involving the
Company), and any references to liquidation or dissolution shall not include
any such transaction not undertaken in connection with any third-party
transaction of the type contemplated above), then the Company shall, on the
date such Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or such Company Acquisition
Agreement is entered into, pay Parent a fee equal to $117,500,000 by wire
transfer of same day funds.

                  (ii) In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover
         Proposal Event (as defined below) shall occur after the date of this
         Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
         Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) and (B) prior to
         the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
         termination the Company consummates a Company Takeover Proposal or
         enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement (provided that for
         purposes of this Section 5.8(b)(ii), the percentage referred to in
         the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be 50% or more and
         any reference in such definition to any merger, consolidation,
         business combination, recapitalization or substantially similar
         transaction involving the Company shall mean any such transaction in
         which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such
         transaction own less than a majority of the outstanding common stock
         or other ownership interests of the Company or the surviving or
         resulting corporation in such transaction immediately following such
         transaction (and shall not include any such transaction solely with a
         wholly owned subsidiary and not involving the Company), and any
         references to liquidation or dissolution shall not include any such
         transaction not undertaken in connection with any third-party
         transaction of the type contemplated above), then the Company shall,
         on the date such Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or such
         Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay Parent a fee equal
         to $235,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds.

                  (iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
         Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d), then concurrently with such
         termination, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to
         $235,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds.

                  (iv) For purposes of this Section 5.8(b), a "Pre-Termination
         Takeover Proposal Event" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the
         event giving rise to the right to terminate this Agreement, a bona
         fide Company Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the
         Company or any of its subsidiaries or has been made directly to its
         stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced an
         intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Takeover
         Proposal, and such Company Takeover Proposal or public announcement
         shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn not less than five business
         days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company
         acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.8(b) are
         an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
         and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
         Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
         amount due pursuant to this Section 5.8(b), and, in order to obtain
         such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment
         against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 5.8(b), the
         Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
         attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
         with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on six-month U.S.
         Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such
         payment was required to be made.

         SECTION 5.9 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to
review, comment upon and concur with and use reasonable efforts to agree on,
any press release or other public statements and any broadly distributed
internal communications with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as either
party may determine is required by applicable law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange and except for any discussions with rating agencies. The parties
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

         SECTION 5.10 Affiliates. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (or to the extent not practicable, as soon as practicable and in any
event within 10 business days after the date hereof), the Company shall
deliver to Parent a written agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit A hereto of all of the persons who are "affiliates" of the Company for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; all of such affiliates, who are
affiliates as of the date of this Agreement, are identified in Section 5.10 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be updated by the Company as necessary to reflect changes from
the date hereof and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
each person added to such schedule after the date hereof to deliver a similar
agreement.

         SECTION 5.11 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use best efforts to
cause the Parent Common Stock issuable (i) under Article II or (ii) upon
exercise of the LTWs and Adjusted Options pursuant to Section 5.6 to be
approved for issuance on the NYSE and the PSX, in each case subject to
official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
and in any event prior to the Closing Date.

         SECTION 5.12 Stockholder Litigation. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense
of any stockholder litigation against the Company or Parent, as applicable,
and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 5.13 Standstill Agreements; Confidentiality Agreements.
During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its respective
subsidiaries is a party and which relates to the confidentiality or
information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or which relate to
securities of the Company. During such period, the Company shall use
reasonably best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by using
reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any
court having jurisdiction.

         SECTION 5.14 Conveyance Taxes. Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer, real
property transfer gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees or any
similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on
or before the Effective Time. The Company shall pay on behalf of its
stockholders any such Taxes or fees imposed by any Governmental Entity which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for which such stockholders are primarily liable and in no event
shall Parent pay such amounts.

         SECTION 5.15 Employee Benefits. (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to, (i) give those Employees who
are, as of the Effective Time, employed by the Company and its subsidiaries
(the "Continuing Employees") full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting
and benefit accruals (other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for such Continuing Employees' service with the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company (or any predecessor entity) to the
same extent recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees under any welfare plan that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare plan
maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and provide credit under any such welfare plan for any copayments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage
period during which any transfer of coverage occurs.

         (b) From and after the Effective Time and through December 31 of the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs (the "Continuation Period"),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the Continuing
Employees compensation and employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
that are, in the aggregate, comparable to those generally provided to such
employees as of the date hereof. From and after the expiration of the
Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
the Continuing Employees compensation and employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements that are no less favorable than those generally provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, each Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated during the twelve-month period (or such longer period as may be
required by the terms of the applicable Company Severance Plan as in effect on
the date hereof) following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive
severance pay and benefits equal to the severance pay and benefits under the
applicable severance plan of the Company listed on Section 5.15(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, as in effect on the date hereof.

         (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor all Plans (including the
Litigation Management Agreement, dated as of February 4, 1998, entered into by
the Company and the other parties thereto, as amended), as in effect on the
date hereof; provided, however, nothing herein shall restrict Parent's or the
Surviving Corporation's ability to amend or terminate such Plans in accordance
with their terms.

         SECTION 5.16 Tax Matters. Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth
in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(c) hereof. This Agreement is intended to constitute
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.368-2(g).
Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver to
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz ("Wachtell"), counsel to the Company, and
Skadden Arps, counsel to Parent, certificates containing appropriate
representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such
law firms, including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the Closing Date,
in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions, pursuant to
Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(c) hereof, with respect to the Tax treatment of the
Merger. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall take or cause to be
taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not
to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of such
certificates and representations.

         SECTION 5.17 Amendment of Warrant Agreement. The Company's Board of
Directors, in accordance with Section 4.5 of the Warrant Agreement, has
determined that, following the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger,
holders of LTWs shall be exercisable in respect of an amount in cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock as provided for in Section 2.6 of this Agreement
and, in connection therewith, the Company shall cause the Warrant Agreement to
be amended and signed by Parent with the consent of the warrant agent to so
provide and to provide for Parent's assumption of the Company's obligations
thereunder by virtue of such determination as provided in Section 2.6.

                                  ARTICLE VI

                             CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

been obtained.

         (b) Governmental and Regulatory Approvals. Other than the filing
provided for under Section 1.3 and the waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act
(which is addressed in Section 6.1(f)), all consents, approvals and actions
of, filings with and notices to any Governmental Entity required by the
Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries under applicable law or
regulation to consummate the Merger, the Bank Combination and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, the failure of which to be obtained or made
would result in a material adverse effect on Parent's ability to conduct the
business in the Company in substantially the same manner as presently
conducted, shall have been obtained or made, including, without limitation,
approval of the Federal Reserve and the OTS Approval (all such approvals and
the expiration of all such waiting periods, the "Requisite Regulatory
Approvals").

         (c) No Injunctions or Restraints. No judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, entered, enacted, promulgated,
enforced or issued by any court or other Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition (collectively,
"Restraints") shall be in effect preventing the consummation of the Merger;
provided, however, that each of the parties shall have used its best efforts
to prevent the entry of any such Restraints and to appeal as promptly as
possible any such Restraints that may be entered.

         (d) Form S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective under the
Securities Act and no stop order or proceedings seeking a stop order shall
have been entered or be pending by the SEC.

         (e) Stock Exchange Listing. The shares of Parent Common Stock

warranties of the Company set forth herein shall be true and correct at and as
of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), provided
that no representation or warranty of the Company shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect for purposes hereunder as a consequence of the existence of any
fact, event or circumstance inconsistent with such representation or warranty,
unless such fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation
or warranty of the Company, has had or would result in a material adverse
effect on the Company, disregarding for these purposes (x) any qualification
or exception for, or reference to, materiality in any such representation or
warranty and (y) any use of the terms "material," "materially," "in all
material respects," "material adverse change," "material adverse effect" or
similar terms or phrases in any such representation or warranty.

         (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all material obligations, taken as a whole,
required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing Date under this
Agreement.

         (c) Regulatory Condition. No condition or requirement has been
imposed by one or more Governmental Entities in connection with any required
approval by them of the Merger or the Bank Combination that requires the
Company or its subsidiaries to be operated in a manner that would have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

         (d) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received the opinion of Skadden,
Arps, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, dated the
Closing Date, rendered on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions
set forth in such opinion and the certificates obtained from officers of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, all of which are consistent with the state
of facts existing as of the Effective Time, to the effect that the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
In rendering the opinion described in this Section 6.2(d), Skadden Arps shall
have received and may rely upon the certificates and representations referred
to in Section 5.16 hereof.

         SECTION 6.3 Conditions to Obligations of the Company. The obligation
of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to satisfaction or
waiver of the following conditions:

         (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Parent set forth herein shall be true and correct at and as of
the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), provided
that no representation or warranty of Parent shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect for purposes hereunder as a consequence of the existence of any
fact, event or circumstance inconsistent with such representation or warranty,
unless such fact, event or circumstance, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation
or warranty of Parent, has had or would result in a material adverse effect on
Parent, disregarding for these purposes (x) any qualification or exception
for, or reference to, materiality in any such representation or warranty and
(y) any use of the terms "material," "materially," "in all material respects,"
"material adverse change," "material adverse effect" or similar terms or
phrases in any such representation or warranty.

         (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent. Parent shall have performed
in all material respects all material obligations, taken as a whole, required
to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing Date under this Agreement.

         (c) Tax Opinion. The Company shall have received the opinion of
Wachtell, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, dated
the Closing Date, rendered on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth in such opinion and the certificates obtained from
officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, all of which are consistent
with the state of facts existing as of the Effective Time, to the effect that
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. In rendering the tax opinion described in this Section
6.3(c), Wachtell shall have received and may rely upon the certificates and
representations referred to in Section 5.16 hereof.

         SECTION 6.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent nor the
Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.1, 6.2
or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such
party's failure to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and
subject to Section 5.5.

                                 ARTICLE VII

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

         SECTION 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, and whether before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval:

         (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

         (b) by either Parent or the Company:

                  (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by the
         date that is twelve months following the date hereof, provided,
         however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
         Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
         perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results in the
         failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

                  (ii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
         obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor
         or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

                  (iii) if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth
         in Section 6.1(c) shall be in effect and shall have become final and
         nonappealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate this
         Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(iii) shall have used
         reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such
         Restraint; or

                  (iv) if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite
         Regulatory Approval has denied the applicable Requisite Regulatory
         Approval and such denial has become final and nonappealable;

         (c) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have failed to make the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company shall have
effected a Change in the Company Recommendation in accordance with the terms
hereof, (iii) the Company shall have effected a Change in the Company
Recommendation in violation of the terms hereof, or (iv) the Company shall
have breached its obligations under this Agreement by reason of a failure to
call or convene the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section
5.1(d);

         (d) by the Company in accordance with Section 4.3(b); provided, that
in order for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (d)
to be deemed effective, the Company shall have complied in all material
respects with all provisions of Section 4.3, including the notice provisions
therein, and with applicable requirements, including the payment of the fee,
referred to in paragraph (b)(iii) of Section 5.8;

         (e) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b), and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the
Company or is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof; or

         (f) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Parent
or is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof.

                  The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
clause (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 7.1 shall give written notice
of such termination to the other party in accordance with Section 8.2,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

         SECTION 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company, other than that
the provisions of Section 5.8, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII shall survive
such termination, provided, however, that nothing herein (including the
payment of any amounts pursuant to Section 5.8 hereof) shall relieve any party
from any liability for any willful breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

         SECTION 7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that after such approval, there shall not be made any amendment that
by law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

         SECTION 7.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the proviso of Section 7.3, waive compliance by the other party
with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                              GENERAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 8.1 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
Section 8.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if delivered personally, telecopied (which is confirmed) or sent by

law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

         SECTION 8.12 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, the Company and Merger Sub have caused
this Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized, all as of the date first written above.

                           Form of Affiliate Letter

Citigroup, Inc.
Corporate Law Department
425 Park Avenue, 2nd Fl.
New York, New York 10043
Attention:  Assistant General Counsel, M&A

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of
Golden State Bancorp Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as that
term is defined in Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"). I understand that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of May 21, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and
among Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Mercury Merger Sub,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") and the
Company, the Company plans to merge with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger")
with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation. Capitalized terms used herein
but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Merger Agreement.

         I further understand that, as a result of the Merger, in exchange for
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock") or upon the exercise of the Company Stock Options that will be
assumed by Parent in the Merger ("Assumed Options"), I may receive common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").

         I have read this letter and discussed the requirements hereof to the
extent I felt necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company.

         I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the
event I receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger or the
exercise of Assumed Options:

         1. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such
Parent Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has
been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), (iii) in the
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or
under a "no-action" letter or interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC,
such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Securities Act, or (iii) I have the right
to have the legend set forth in Sections 3 and 4 below removed pursuant to
Section 4 below.

         2. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my
behalf under the Securities Act or, other than as set forth below, to take any
other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available.

         3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock issued to me
as a result of the Merger or the exercise of Assumed Options and that there
will be placed on the certificates, if any, for such shares, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

                  "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a
                  transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
                  Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented by
                  this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with
                  the terms of a letter agreement between the registered
                  holder hereof and Citigroup Inc., a copy of which agreement
                  is on file at the principal offices of Citigroup Inc."

         4. I understand that, unless the transfer by me of the Parent Common
Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger or upon the exercise of Assumed
Options has been registered under the Securities Act or such transfer is made
in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act,
Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following
legend on the certificates, if any, issued to my transferee:

                  "The shares represented by this certificate have not been
                  registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were
                  acquired from a person who received such shares in a
                  transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of
                  1933 applies. The shares may not be sold, transferred or
                  otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective
                  registration statement under, or in accordance with an
                  exemption from the registration requirements of, the
                  Securities Act of 1933."

         It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs
(3) and (4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legend and/or any stop transfer instructions will be lifted (A)
if one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) or any
successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent
Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) (or
any successor thereto) are then available to me, (B) if two years (or such
other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) or any successor thereto)
shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received
in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) (or any successor thereto)
are then available to me or (C) if I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy
of a "no-action" letter or interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC, or
an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities
Act or (ii) a written statement from me representing that that the Parent
Common Stock represented by such certificates are being or have been sold in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act.

         Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my
part of "affiliate" status as described in the first paragraph of this letter
agreement, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that
I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.



                                             Very truly yours,

                                             By: _______________________
