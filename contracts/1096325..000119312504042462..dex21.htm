vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of the 14th day of March, 2004, by and among Intersil Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), New Castle Merger Sub Corp., a California
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the LLC (" _Merger Sub_ "), and New
Castle Sub LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company wholly
owned by Parent (the "LLC"), and Xicor, Inc., a California corporation (the "
_Company_ ").



Background



A. The Board of Directors of Parent has determined that a combination with the
Company is in the best interests of its shareholders.



B. The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that a
combination with Parent is in the best interests of its stockholders.



C. The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and
the manager of the LLC believe it is fair to and in the best interests of
their respective companies and the shareholders, stockholders or sole member
of their respective companies that the Company and the Merger Sub combine
into a single company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the " _Step One Merger_ ") and the merger of the Company, as
surviving corporation of the Step One Merger, with and into the LLC (the "
_Step Two Merger_ ," and together with the Step One Merger, the " _Mergers_
"), with the LLC being the ultimate surviving entity in the Mergers, and, in
furtherance thereof, have approved and declared the advisability of this
Agreement and the Mergers, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with the California General Corporation Law
(the " _CGCL_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ").



D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to Parents, Merger Subs and LLCs and the Companys willingness
to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers
of the Company is entering into a Voting Agreement in the form attached as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Voting Agreement_ ").



E. If the value of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Step One Merger
valued at the Average Closing Price as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
is 40% or more of the total consideration to be paid in exchange for the
Company Shares (including, without limitation, the amount of cash to be paid
in lieu of fractional shares or for Dissenting Shares and any other payments
required to be considered in determining whether the continuity of interest
requirements applicable to reorganizations under Section 368 of the Code have
been satisfied) (the " _Tax Free Valuation Test_ "), then the parties intend
that the Mergers constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").



F. The parties intend that the Mergers be accounted for as a purchase
transaction for financial accounting purposes. Terms



In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and intending to be
legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I 



THE MERGERS



1.1. _The Step One Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.2(a)) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Agreement of Merger in connection with the Step One Merger attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Agreement of Merger_ ") and the applicable provisions
of the CGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Step One Merger. The Company as
the interim surviving corporation following the Step One Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Interim Surviving Corporation_."



1.2. _Effective Time; Closing_.



(a) Concurrently with the Closing (as defined in Section 1.2(b)), the parties
shall cause the Step One Merger to be consummated by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of California (the " _Secretary of State_
") an Agreement of Merger in accordance with Chapter 11 of the CGCL. The Step
One Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") when
the Agreement of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State or at such
later time as shall be agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Agreement of Merger.



(b) The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ")
shall be held at the offices of Dechert LLP, 975 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California, at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second business day following the
date on which the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof),
or at such other place or time or on such other date as Parent and the Company
may agree. The date on which the Closing takes place is referred to herein as

amended to read in their entirety as set forth as _Exhibit E_ hereto until
thereafter amended as provided by CGCL, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Interim Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.



 

2 1.5. _Directors and Officers of the Interim Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Interim Surviving Corporation,
and the corporate officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the officers of the Interim Surviving Corporation, in each
case, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.



1.6. _Step Two Merger_.



(a) _Timing_. Immediately following the Effective Time on the Closing Date,
the Interim Surviving Corporation shall be merged directly with and into the
LLC in accordance with DGCL and CGCL. Following the Step Two Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall cease
and the LLC shall continue as the Surviving Company of the Step Two Merger.
The LLC, as the surviving company following the Step Two Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Company_."



(b) _Step Two Merger Effective Time_. Immediately following the Effective Time
on the Closing Date, the Step Two Merger shall be consummated by the LLC
filing a Certificate of Merger (the " _Step Two Certificate of Merger_ ") as
required by applicable law with respect to the Step Two Merger. The Step Two
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Step Two Certificate
of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (the " _Step Two
Merger Effective Time_ ").



(c) _Effect of the Step Two Merger_. At the Step Two Merger Effective Time,
the effect of the Step Two Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Step Two Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of applicable
law. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Step Two Merger Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Interim Surviving Corporation shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Interim Surviving Corporation shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.



(d) _Certificate of Formation; Operating Agreement_.



(i) At the Step Two Merger Effective Time, the Certificate of Formation
of the LLC, as in effect immediately prior to the Step Two Merger Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended as provided by DGCL and such Certificate of Formation.



(ii) At the Step Two Merger Effective Time, the Operating Agreement of
the LLC, as in effect immediately prior to the Step Two Merger Effective
Time, shall constitute the Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended as provided by law, the Certificate of Formation of the
Surviving Company and such Operating Agreement.



(e) _Manager and Officers_. At the Step Two Effective Time, the manager of
the LLC immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the manager of the
Surviving Company, and the officers of the LLC immediately prior to the Step
Two Merger Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.



 

3 (f) _Treatment of Capital Stock In Step Two Merger_. Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, at the Step Two Merger Effective Time, automatically by
virtue of the Step Two Merger and without any action on the part of any
shareholder:



(i) each membership interest of the LLC outstanding immediately prior to the
Step Two Merger shall be unchanged and shall remain issued and
outstanding; and



(ii) each share of Interim Surviving Corporation common stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Step Two Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled
without consideration and shall cease to be an issued and outstanding share of
Interim Surviving Corporation common stock.



1.7. _Alternative Merger Structure_. If the Tax Free Valuation Test is not
met, then the parties shall restructure the transaction to provide only for
the Step One Merger, with the Company being the ultimate surviving entity in
the Merger, any reference to "Surviving Company" in this Agreement shall mean
the Company, as the surviving entity of the Merger, and any reference to
"Mergers" in this Agreement shall mean "Merger."



ARTICLE II

without any action on the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of
capital stock or securities of the Company:



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Step One Merger and without
any further action on the part of Parent, the Company or any shareholder of
the Company but subject to the other provisions of Article II of this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding,
other than Excluded Shares (as such term is defined in Section 2.1(h) below)
and Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be converted into and shall be cancelled
in exchange for the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as
provided in Section 2.1(c), either: 



(i) cash in an amount equal to the sum of (A) $8.00 (such amount, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.1(e), the " _Average Cash Per Share_ ") and (B) the
product of (x) 0.335 (such number of shares, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.1(e), the " _Average Stock Per Share_ ") multiplied by (y) the Average
Closing Price (such amount, the " _Cash Consideration_ "); or



(ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (A) the
Average Stock Per Share and (B) the quotient (x) the Average Cash Per

and together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").



 

4 (b) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed as to holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no transfer of Company Common Stock by any such holder
shall thereafter be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are properly presented in accordance with Article II of this
Agreement to the Exchange Agent, such certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged for certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, and/or a check representing the amount of cash, if any,
into which the Company Common Stock represented thereby was converted in the
Mergers, plus any payment for a fractional share of Parent Common Stock.



(c) _Election and Proration Procedures_.



(i) _Election Forms and Types of Elections_. An election form in such form and
substance as designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed by the Company with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock as of the Company Record Date. Parent shall
make available one or more Election Forms as may be reasonably requested by
all persons who become holders of Company Common Stock after the Company
Record Date and prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall promptly
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all information in the
Companys possession reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein. Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each
Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to elect (an "
_Election_ ") to receive either (A) Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_
") with respect to all of such holders Company Common Stock, (B) cash (a "
_Cash Election_ ") with respect to all of such holders Company Common Stock,
or (C) Parent Common Stock in exchange for either a specified number of shares
of Company Common Stock (a " _Combination Stock Election_ ") and cash in
exchange for a specified number of shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Combination Cash Election_ "). Any Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares or Excluded Shares) with respect to which the holder (or
indirectly the beneficial owner) shall not have submitted to the Exchange
Agent an effective, properly completed Election Form, which was received prior
to the Election Deadline, shall be deemed to be " _Undesignated Shares_ "
under this Agreement.



(ii) _Proper and Timely Election_. Any Election shall have been properly made
and effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by 5:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day
prior to the Closing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and
Parent may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "). An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only if an Election is indicated for each
share of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior
to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Election Form shall automatically become Undesignated Shares unless and
until a new Election is properly made with respect to such shares on or before
the Election Deadline, and Parent shall cause the certificates representing
such shares of Company Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to
the person submitting the revoked Election Form upon written request to that
effect from the



 

5 holder who submitted such Election Form. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, Parent shall have discretion, which it
may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether
any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any decisions of
Parent and Company required by the Exchange Agent and made in good faith in
determining such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor
the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in an Election Form.



(iii) _Allocation_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Mergers, all
of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding (other than Dissenting
Shares and Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an
aggregate consideration consisting of the Maximum Cash Consideration and the
Maximum Stock Consideration, and that the sum of the Maximum Cash
Consideration and Maximum Stock Consideration (the " _Aggregate Consideration_
") shall be allocated among the holders of Company Common Stock (other than
the Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares, if any) based on their ownership of
Company Common Stock, their elections and the proration procedures set forth
below.



(iv) _Payment and Proration_. As promptly as practicable but not later than
five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock of
rights to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Step One Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows:



(1) In the event that the amount of cash payable in respect of shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which Cash Elections and Combination
Cash Elections have been made and not subsequently revoked or changed
(collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Cash Election
Number, all shares in respect of which Stock Elections and Combination Stock
Elections have been made and not subsequently revoked or changed (the " _Stock
Election Shares_ ") and all Undesignated Shares in respect of which Stock
Elections have been deemed to have been made (it being understood that in
such case all Undesignated Shares shall be deemed to be shares in respect of
which Stock Elections have been made) shall be converted into the right to
receive Stock Consideration, and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration in the
following manner:



(A) Cash Election Shares shall be deemed converted to Stock Election Shares,
on a pro-rata basis for each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock with respect to those shares, if any, of such record holder that are
Cash Election Shares, so that the number of Cash Election Shares so converted
into Stock Election Shares, when added to the existing Stock Election Shares,
shall equal as closely as practicable the Stock Election Number, and all such
Cash Election Shares so converted into Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional interests); and



(B) any remaining Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive Cash Consideration.



 

6 (2) In the event that the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds
the Stock Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Undesignated
Shares in respect of which Cash Elections are deemed to have been made (it
being understood that in such case all Undesignated Shares shall be deemed to
be shares in respect of which Cash Elections have been made) shall be
converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration, and all Stock Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration or
Cash Consideration in the following manner:



(A) Stock Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Cash
Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis for each record holder of shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to those shares, if any, of such record
holder that are Stock Election Shares, so that the number of Stock Election
Shares so converted into Cash Election Shares, when added to the existing
Cash Election Shares, shall equal as closely as practicable the Cash Election
Number, and all such Stock Election Shares so converted into Cash Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration;
and



(B) the remaining Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional interests).



(3) In the event that neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this Section
2.1(c)(iv) is applicable, Undesignated Shares shall be deemed Stock
Election Shares such that the total number of Stock Election Shares equals
the Stock Election Number and any remaining Undesignated Shares shall be
deemed Cash Election Shares with the result that (x) all Cash Election Shares
and all Undesignated Shares in respect of which Cash Elections are deemed to
have been made shall be converted into the right to receive Cash
Consideration, and (y) all Stock Election Shares and all Undesignated Shares
in respect of which Stock Elections are deemed to have been made shall be
converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional interests).



(d) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled and
extinguished and shall not be converted.



(e) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the Average
Cash Per Share and/or Average Stock Per Share, as applicable, shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary
dividend or distribution, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or the Company Common
Stock occurring or having a record date or an effective date on or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.



(f) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of
the Step One Merger. Instead, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded
down to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Average Closing Price.



 

7 (g) As of March 11, 2004, the Maximum Stock Consideration would be 9,779,283.4
shares of Parent Common Stock and the Maximum Cash Consideration would be
$233,535,132. The conversion of Company Shares for either cash or shares of
Parent Common Stock is further explained on _Exhibit F_ attached to this
Agreement.



(h) For purposes of Section 2.1, any calculation of a portion of a share
of Parent Common Stock shall be rounded to the nearest fifth decimal place,
and any cash payment shall be rounded to the nearest cent.



(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Excluded Shares_ " means any shares of
Company Common Stock held as of the Effective Time (i) by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) by the Company as treasury shares; the "
_Maximum Cash Consideration_ " shall mean the amount equal to the product of
(x) the Average Cash Per Share and (y) the number of issued shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time minus the sum of (A) the
number of shares of Excluded Shares and (B) the number of Dissenting Shares;
the " _Maximum Stock Consideration_ " shall mean the number of shares equal
to the product of (x) the Average Stock Per Share and (y) the number of issued
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time minus
the sum of (A) the number of shares of Excluded Shares and (B) the number of
Dissenting Shares; the " _Cash Election Number_ " shall mean the quotient of
(i) the Maximum Cash Consideration divided by (ii) the Cash Consideration; the
" _Stock Election Number_ " shall mean the quotient of (i) the Maximum
Stock Consideration divided by (ii) the Stock Consideration; and the "
_Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the lesser of (i) the closing price of a
share of Parent Common Stock on the day before the Closing Date and (ii) the
average of the high and low trading prices of the Parent Common Stock on the
day before the Closing Date.



2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As promptly as practical, and in no event later than 5
business days, following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or
such other exchange agent as may be designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section
2.2, certificates representing shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and cash in an amount required to be paid pursuant to this
Article II (such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock and cash, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and/or the Cash Consideration



 

8 (" _Certificates_ "), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify, including offering holders of Certificates the
ability to hold their shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in book entry form
in lieu of the certificates provided for below and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Class A Common Stock. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate or certificates
representing that whole number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in such
denominations and registered in such names as such holder may request and (y)
a check representing the amount of Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, after deduction of any required withholding tax. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration or the cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered on the
transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number
of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, together with a check for the Cash
Consideration plus cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, may be issued to such transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock held by
such transferee is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, no dividend or other distribution declared
or made after the Effective Time with respect to any shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock having a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no Merger Consideration or
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder,
until the holder shall surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section
2.3. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.9),
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of surrender of such Certificate, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Class A Common
Stock and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be
required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to
surrender of such Certificate, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding
taxes that may be required thereon.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company



 

9 Common Stock represented thereby, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. All
Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section
2.3. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person constituting an
"affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder,
the " _Securities Act_ "), shall not be exchanged until Parent has received
written undertakings from such person in the form attached as _Exhibit B_.



(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Company Common Stock 180 days after the
date of the mailing required by Section 2.2(b) shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand therefor, and holders of Certificates previously representing
shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(a), or any dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.



(f) _No Liability_. Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time of the Mergers (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, or any cash in lieu of fractional shares
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.5)), any such
shares, dividends or distributions or cash in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. 



(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.3(e). 



(h) _Missing Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and
providing an appropriate indemnity or surety bond consistent with Parents
ordinary course with respect to its own stockholders by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and other
distributions, if any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.



 

10 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective Time, are or
may become "Dissenting Shares" within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the
California Corporations Code shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, and the
holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may
be granted to such holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the CGCL; provided,
however, that if the status of any such shares as "Dissenting Shares" shall
not be perfected, or if any such shares shall lose their status as "Dissenting
Shares," then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent Undesignated Shares in
accordance with Section 2.1(c)(i).



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company
to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to Chapter 13 of
the CGCL and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or
settlement offer.



2.4. _Treatment of Stock Options; ESPP_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such actions as
may be necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") outstanding as of the
Effective Time to be automatically converted at the Effective Time into an
option (a " _Converted Option_ ") to purchase Parent Common Stock. Each
Converted Option will continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the
same terms and conditions, except that (i) each Converted Option shall be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such converted Company Option
will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent, and (iii) only with respect to those individuals
set forth in Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (" _Accelerated
Optionees_ "), prior to the Effective Time the Company shall take such
actions necessary to amend the Company Options granted to such Accelerated
Optionees to provide that all unvested Company Options shall become 100%
vested as of the Effective Time. Continuous employment or service with
Company or its subsidiaries shall be credited to the optionee for all purposes
with respect to Company Options, including for purposes of determining the
vesting of all converted Company Options after the Effective Time. " _Option
Exchange Ratio_ " means the Stock



 

11 Consideration. The conversion of Company Options provided for in this Section
2.4(a) with respect to any Company Options that are intended to be "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a
manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and otherwise in a manner
designed to preserve incentive stock option treatment, except that any
incentive stock options granted to Accelerated Optionees that are accelerated
in accordance with this Section 2.4(a) shall be accelerated even if the such
acceleration causes such Company Options to no longer qualify as incentive
stock options.



(b) Parent agrees to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five
business days after the Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8 or
other appropriate form under the Securities Act to register the shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the Converted Options and use its
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective
until the exercise or expiration of such options.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall establish a "New Exercise
Date" as such term is defined in the Companys 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Company 423 Plan_ ") for all purchase rights under the Company
423 Plan that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with Section 19(c) of the Company 423 Plan, in accordance with the
following provisions:



(i) Only if the Closing occurs on or before April 30, 2004, this Section
2.4(c)(i) shall apply. Under this Section 2.4(c)(i), the New Exercise Date
shall be April 30, 2004, and all outstanding purchase rights (each an "
_Assumed Purchase Right_ ") under the Company 423 Plan as of the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Parent. The Assumed Purchase Rights shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in the Company
423 Plan with the New Exercise Date established in accordance with this
Section 2.4(c)(i) and the documents governing the Assumed Purchase Rights,
except that the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable upon
exercise thereof shall equal the number of shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise issuable upon exercise thereof multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio and the purchase price of such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock on
the Purchase Date (as defined in the Company 423 Plan) shall be the lower of
(i) the quotient determined by dividing 85% of the fair market value per share
of the Company Common Stock on the "Enrollment Date" (as defined in the
Company 423 Plan) of the Assumed Purchase Right by the Option Exchange Ratio
or (ii) 85% of the fair market value per share of the Parent Class A Common
Stock on the "New Exercise Date" (with the number of shares rounded down to
the nearest whole share and the purchase price rounded up to the nearest whole
cent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assumed Purchase Right shall be
converted from a right to purchase Company Common Stock under the Company 423
Plan to the right to purchase Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with
Section 424 of the Code. The Assumed Purchase Rights shall be exercised on the
New Exercise Date, and each participant in the Company 423 Plan shall,
accordingly, be issued shares of Parent Class A Common Stock at such time.



(ii) Only if the Closing occurs on or after May 1, 2004 but on or before
September 30, 2004, shall this Section 2.4(c)(ii) apply. Under this Section
2.4(c)(ii), the New Exercise Date shall be September 30, 2004, and all
outstanding purchase rights under the 



 

12 Company 423 Plan as of the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and
become Assumed Purchase Rights, which shall be converted to purchase rights
to purchase Company Common Stock in the same manner as described in Section
2.4(c)(i) above using the New Exercise Date provided for in this Section
2.4(c)(ii). The Assumed Purchase Rights shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in the Company 423 Plan
with the New Exercise Date established in accordance with this Section
2.4(c)(i). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assumed Purchase Right shall be
converted from a right to purchase Company Common Stock under the Company 423
Plan to the right to purchase Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with
Section 424 of the Code. The Assumed Purchase Rights shall be exercised on the
New Exercise Date, and each participant in the Company 423 Plan shall,
accordingly, be issued shares of Parent Class A Common Stock at such time.



(iii) Only if the Closing occurs on or after October 1, 2004, shall this
Section 2.4(c)(iii) apply. Under this Section 2.4(c)(iii), the New Exercise
Date shall be the date established by the Company in accordance with Section
19(c) of the Plan under the Company 423 Plan which date may not be later than
the Closing Date. Outstanding purchase rights shall be exercised prior to the
Effective Time and no outstanding purchase rights under the Company 423 Plan
shall be assumed by the Parent or the Parent 423 Plan.



(iv) Regardless of whether Section 2.4(c)(i), 2.4(c)(ii) or 2.4(c)(iii)
applies, the provisions of this Section 2.4(c)(iv) shall apply in any event.
The Company 423 Plan and all outstanding purchase rights thereunder shall
terminate on the New Exercise Date, and no additional purchase rights shall be
granted and no additional Purchase Periods shall commence following such date.
Parent agrees that employees of Company may participate in Parents employee
stock purchase plan (the "Parent 423 Plan"), subject to the terms and
conditions of such Parent 423 Plan and to the extent permitted by the Code,
beginning with the first Purchase Period (as defined in the Parent 423 Plan)
that begins following the New Exercise Date.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



In order to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except
as set forth in the written disclosure schedule prepared by the Company which
is dated as of the date of this Agreement and arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article
III and was previously delivered to Parent in connection herewith (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ "): 



3.1. _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of California with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and

Company and each subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business
and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so
qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in
such jurisdiction, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3) on
the Company. The Company is not in default in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any material provision of its Articles of Incorporation or its
Bylaws, each as in effect on the date hereof (the " _Company Certificate_ "

or indirectly each of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or other
ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to

claims or other commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance,
sale, repurchase or transfer of any capital stock or other securities of any
subsidiary of the Company, nor are there outstanding any securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or other
securities of any subsidiary of the Company, and neither the Company nor any
subsidiary of the Company has any obligation of any kind to issue any
additional shares of capital stock or other securities of any subsidiary of
the Company or to pay for or repurchase any shares of capital stock or other
securities of any subsidiary of the Company or any predecessor thereof.



3.3. _Corporate Power and Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and, subject to approval of the Mergers and the

by the shareholders of the Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and

life or disability coverage for any period of time beyond retirement or
termination of employment.



(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby either solely as a result thereof or
in conjunction with any other events will result in, or constitute an event
which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both will result
in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or
value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby either solely as a result thereof or in conjunction with
any other events will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of

interim financial statements, to normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments
consistent with past practice), in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for

provided by Parent for inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy

the case of the Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing and at the date of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein (and, in the case of the
Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made),
not misleading. The Proxy Statement, except for the portion thereof that
relates to the Company and its subsidiaries (as to which no representations
or warranties are made), will comply as to form in all material respects with

Parent or a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Since December 31, 2003, Parent has not been
subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree specifically
applicable to Parent which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably

to the date hereof, (ii) as incurred after December 31, 2003 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with prior practice and not prohibited by

through the date hereof any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether

(a) Since December 31, 2003 through the date of this Agreement and except for
entering into this Agreement, Parent has not engaged in any transaction,

since December 31, 2003, to the Parents knowledge, no material supplier
of Parent has indicated in writing that it will stop or materially decrease
the supply of materials, products or services to Parent, in each case, the

to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



 

35 4.14. _Permits; Compliance_. Parent is in possession of all material
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted (collectively, the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the
failure to be in possession of such Parent Permits would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.



4.15. _Environmental Matters_. Except for matters disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed prior to the date hereof and except as would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Parent, the Parent and its subsidiaries and the properties
and operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries and, with respect to the
operations of the Parent, its predecessors, are not subject to any pending or,
to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened action under any Environmental Law,
including without limitation with respect to any present or former
operations, facilities or subsidiaries and, with respect to the operations of
the Parent, its predecessors. Except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect on

subsidiaries or their predecessors or any of their respective present or
former operations or facilities is or may be a potentially responsible party
or otherwise liable in connection with any site used for the disposal of or
otherwise containing Hazardous Materials, or (y) to the knowledge of the
Parent, without further inquiry, has disposed of, arranged for the disposal

employee thereof has incurred or will incur on behalf of Parent any brokerage,
finders or similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



4.17. _Reorganization_. Assuming that the Tax Free Valuation Test is
satisfied, Parent knows of no reason that would cause the Mergers to fail to
qualify as reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither Parent
nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action (other than
actions specifically contemplated by the Agreement) that would prevent the
Mergers from constituting a reorganization qualifying under the provisions
of Section 368(a) of the Code.



 

36 4.18. _Compliance with Law_. Except as specifically disclosed in the Parent
SEC Documents filed with the Commission prior to the date hereof, the Parent

Authority, relating to the Parent or its business or properties. Except as
specifically disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the Commission

Governmental Authority with respect to the Parent is pending, or, to the
knowledge of the Parent, threatened, nor has any Governmental
Authority indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same.

years, received notice from any third party that the operation of the business
of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any act, product or service of Parent

Property of any third party or constitutes unfair competition or trade
practices under the laws of any jurisdiction.



4.20. _Certain Transactions_. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is a
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or any Contract associated with off balance

5.2. _Covenants of Parent_.



(a) _Registration Statement_. Parent shall prepare and file the Registration
Statement with the Commission as soon as is reasonably practicable and shall
use all reasonable



 

39 efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the
Commission as promptly as practicable and to maintain the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement through the Effective Time. If, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain knowledge of any information
pertaining to Parent that would require an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement, Parent shall so advise the Company in writing and
shall promptly furnish the Company with all information as shall be required
for such amendment or supplement and shall promptly take such action as shall
be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement. Parent shall
take such other reasonable actions (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified) required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock in the Mergers.



(b) _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer,
employee or agent (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel selected by
the Indemnified Person with the consent of Parent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation (each a " _Claim_ ") to the extent such Indemnified Person acted
in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest
of the Company and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, to the extent such
Indemnified Person had no reasonable cause to believe such Indemnified
Persons conduct was unlawful and to the extent that any such Claim is based
on, or arises out of: (x) the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise; or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case to the extent that any such Claim pertains to any matter
or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to or at the Effective
Time, regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the full extent permitted under the CGCL, the
Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws or any indemnification agreement in
effect prior to the date hereof and listed in Section 5.2(c) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule (complete and correct copies of which have been previously
provided to Parent), including provisions relating to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any such Claim. Without limiting the generality of
the preceding sentence, in the event any Indemnified Person becomes involved
in any Claim, after the Effective Time, Parent shall periodically advance to
such Indemnified Person its legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject
to the provisions of paragraph (ii) of this Section 5.2(b), and subject to the
providing by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to reimburse all
amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled
thereto.



 

40 (ii) The Indemnified Person shall control the defense of any Claim with
counsel selected by the Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent, provided that Parent shall be permitted to participate
in the defense of such Claim at its own expense. Parent shall not be obligated
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Persons in any single Claim except to the extent that, in the opinion of
independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person, which counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, representation of two or more of
such Indemnified Persons would present a conflict of interest under applicable
standards of conduct in the legal profession. Parent shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its written consent, which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld.



(iii) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification of
liabilities, and all limitations with respect thereto, existing in favor of
any Indemnified Person, as provided in the Company Certificate or the Company
Bylaws and any indemnification agreement in effect at the date hereof and
listed in Section 5.2(b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the
Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Claim is asserted or
made, any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
CGCL, the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws or any such agreement, as
the case may be, shall be made as permitted by the CGCL; and _provided_
_further_ that nothing in this Section 5.2(c) shall impair any rights or
obligations of any current or former director or officer of the Company or its
subsidiaries, including pursuant to the respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the Company, or their respective
subsidiaries, under the CGCL or otherwise.



(iv) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with terms and conditions that are no less
advantageous to former officers and directors of the Company) only with
respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to pay in the
aggregate for DandO Insurance in excess of 750% of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
possible for such amount.



(v) The provisions of this Section 5.2(b) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives. Parent will not, nor will
Parent permit the Surviving Corporation to, merge or consolidate with any
other Person or sell all or substantially all of Parents or such subsidiarys
assets unless Parent or the Surviving Corporation ensures that the surviving
or resulting entity assumes the obligations imposed by this Section 5.2(b).



(c) _Executive Vice President of Parent_. Simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement and effective at the Effective Time, Parent appointed Louis
DiNardo to serve as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the
Standard Linear Products Group of Parent.



 

41 (d) _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Mergers
(including, without limitation, the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of the Converted Options) to be approved for
listing on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.



(e)  _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would likely cause any representation or
warranty by Parent contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at
or prior to the Effective Time in any material respect and (ii) any material
failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.2(e)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
Company.



(f) _Employees and Employee Benefits_. From and after the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided in Section 2.4, Parent shall treat all service
for vesting and eligibility purposes by the Company Employees (as defined
below) with the Company and their respective predecessors prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent credited under the terms of the Company Plans
prior to the Effective Time, as service with Parent for eligibility and
vesting purposes under Parents employee benefits plans and on or before the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, provide Company Employees with benefits that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated
Parent employees. With respect to any medical or dental benefit plan in which
the Company Employees participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall use
all reasonable efforts to waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such waiver shall apply to a pre-existing condition of any
Company Employee who was, as of the Effective Time, treated under a Company
Plan as a pre-existing condition), and shall provide that any covered expenses
incurred on or before the Effective Time by a Company Employee or a Company
Employees covered dependent shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions after the Effective Time to the same extent as such expenses are
taken into account for the benefit of similarly situated employees of Parent
and subsidiaries of Parent. For purposes of this Section 5.2(f), " _Company
Employees_ " shall mean persons who are, as of the Effective Time, employees
of the Company.



(g)  _Subsequent Financial Statements_. Parent shall provide to the Company,
sufficiently in advance so as to permit a reasonable period of time to review
and discuss the contents thereof, its financial results for any period after
the date of this Agreement prior to making such results publicly available,
it being understood that the Company shall have no liability by reason of such
review and discussion.



 

(h) _Prohibition on Certain Transactions_.



(i) Prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, without the written
consent of the Company, Parent shall not enter into a definitive agreement,
or



 

42 publicly announce an intention to enter into a definitive agreement for any
acquisition, disposition, merger or other business combination involving
Parent or any of its subsidiaries if such transaction would present a material
risk of making it materially more difficult to obtain any HSR approval or
authorization or Agreed Foreign Approvals.



(ii) Prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, if Parent
enters into a definitive agreement, or publicly announce an intention to
enter into a definitive agreement, without the written consent of the Company,
to acquire a business where a comparison of the most recent annual financial
statements of the business to be acquired and Parents most recent annual
consolidated financial statements filed at or prior to the date of acquisition
indicates that the business would be a significant subsidiary pursuant to the
conditions specified in Section 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated under
the Exchange Act, then the Termination Date (as such term is defined in
Section 7.1(c)) shall be extended to December 31, 2004 applicable to Parents
right to terminate this Agreement.



5.3. _Covenants of the Company_.



(a) _The Company Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall take all action in
accordance with the federal securities laws, the CGCL and the Company

date following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and mutually
determined by the parties, to consider and vote upon approval of the Mergers,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Section
5.3(d), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board

Companys obligation to hold and convene the Company Shareholders Meeting
(regardless of whether the Company Board Recommendation shall have
been withdrawn, amended or modified).



(b) _Proxy Statement; Registration Statement_. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent in the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement in a
timely fashion and shall use all reasonable efforts to assist Parent in having

Statement through the Effective Time. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall obtain knowledge of any information pertaining to the
Company that would require any amendment or supplement to the Registration

writing and shall promptly furnish Parent with all information as shall be
required for such amendment or supplement and shall promptly take such action
as shall be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement and/or
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to mail at the

to be furnished to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the
Mergers and the transactions contemplated thereby and shall include the
written opinion of Wachovia Securities described in Section 3.23, to the
extent such opinion is then in effect, and the Company Board Recommendation to
the extent not previously withdrawn in compliance with Section 5.3(d).

shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its employees (who are
not officers), directly or indirectly, to (A) solicit, initiate, encourage or

enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring the Company

before the approval of the Mergers by the shareholders of the Company, the
Company may furnish information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in
discussions with, any person who delivers a _bona_   _fide_ written proposal
for a Competing Transaction that was not solicited or encouraged after the
date of this Agreement if and to the extent the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action would reasonably
be likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company under Applicable Laws and determines in good faith by
a majority vote, after consulting with Wachovia Securities (or any other
nationally recognized investment banking firm), that such proposal for the
Competing Transaction constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company prior to taking
any such action notifies Parent not less than two business days prior to
taking such action (which notice shall identify the person making the proposal
and describe the terms thereof) and receives from the person making the
proposal an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as
restrictive on the other person as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
(as defined in Section 5.3(f)) are to Parent. The Company shall notify Parent
of any proposal for a Competing Transaction (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the person making it) as promptly as
practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) after its receipt thereof,
and shall thereafter inform Parent on a prompt basis of any material changes
to the terms and conditions of such proposal, and shall promptly give Parent a
copy of any information delivered to such person that has not previously been
reviewed by Parent. The Company shall immediately cease, and shall cause its
and its subsidiaries respective officers, directors and representatives to
cease, all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal for a Competing
Transaction. A " _Superior Proposal_ " is a proposal for a Competing
Transaction that is, if accepted, reasonably likely to be consummated and is
more favorable to the Companys



 

46 shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions
proposed by Parent in response to such Competing Transaction).



(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.3(d), in the event
that before the approval of the Mergers by the shareholders of the
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
do so would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board
of Directors under Applicable Laws, the Board of Directors of the Company may
(subject to this and the following sentences) (A) withdraw, amend or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation and (B) in the
event of any such withdrawal, amendment or modification in connection with a
Competing Transaction (after giving effect to any adjustment to the terms and
conditions proposed by Parent in response to such Competing Transaction) take
and disclose to the shareholders of the Company a position with respect to a
Superior Proposal by disclosing such withdrawn, amended or modified Company
Board Recommendation and, to the extent applicable, a recommendation with
respect to such Superior Proposal in connection with a tender or exchange
offer for the Company securities; _provided_ that in the case of clause (B)
the Company has complied with its obligations under this Section 5.3(d) in
connection with such Superior Proposal and gives Parent two business days
prior written notice of its intention to do so. Consistent with the terms of
this Section 5.3(d), the Company may take any action to the extent necessary
in order to comply with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. The Company Board of Directors shall not, in connection with any such
withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Company Board Recommendation,
take any action to change the approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law
to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including this
Agreement and the Mergers. If the reason for the change in the Company Board
Recommendation is the Companys receipt of a proposal for a Competing
Transaction that it has determined to be a Superior Proposal, and within such
two business day period, Parent proposes in writing to modify the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors shall
determine in good faith whether such terms as modified by Parent are at least
as favorable to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view as
such Superior Proposal, and if the Companys Board of Directors determines in
good faith that such terms as modified are at least as favorable as such
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may not withdraw,
amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation.



(e) _Affiliates of the Company_. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause each person listed in Section 5.3(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and each additional person, if any, who may be at the Effective Time
an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act to execute and deliver to Parent no less than 30 days prior to the date
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the written undertakings in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Company Affiliate Letter_ "). The
foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be entitled to place legends as
specified in the Company Affiliate Letter on the certificates evidencing any
of the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be received by (i) any such
"affiliate" of the Company specified in such letter or (ii) any person Parent
reasonably identifies (by written notice to the Company) as being a person who
may be



 

47 deemed an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop
transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock, consistent with the terms of the Company Affiliate Letter,
regardless of whether such person has executed the Company Affiliate Letter
and regardless of whether such persons name appears on the letter to be
delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence.



(f) _Access_. The Company shall permit representatives of Parent to have
reasonable access at all reasonable times to the Companys
premises, properties, books, records, contracts, documents, customers and
suppliers, and shall cause its independent accountants to give Parent access
to such accountants work papers; provided, however, that such access to any
of the Companys premises shall be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures, operating procedures and insurance requirements and shall
not include the right to perform any "invasive" testing or any investigation
that requires the consent of any landlord or lender of landlord. Information
obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) shall be subject to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement by and between Parent and the
Company, dated as of March 8, 2004 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which agreement remains in full force and effect. No investigation conducted
pursuant to this Section 5.3(f) or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to provide Parent with
information if the Company determines in good faith, upon written advice of
its outside antitrust counsel, that providing information may violate any
Applicable Laws.



(g) _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence
or non-occurrence of which would likely cause any representation or warranty
by the Company contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or
prior to the Effective Time in any material respect and (ii) any material
failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.3(g)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
Parent.



(h) _Subsequent Financial Statements_. The Company shall provide to Parent,
sufficiently in advance so as to permit a reasonable period of time to review
and discuss the contents thereof, its financial results for any period after
the date of this Agreement prior to making such results publicly available and
prior to filing any Company SEC Documents after the date of this Agreement,
it being understood that Parent shall have no liability by reason of such
review and discussion.



(i) _No Redemption of Rights Plan_. Other than the amendment described in
Section 5.3(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, between the date of
this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall not (a) redeem, amend or waive any
provisions of the Rights Plan (other than such amendments as are necessary to
accommodate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but not
with respect to any Competing Transaction) or (b) implement or adopt any so-
called "poison pill," shareholder rights plan or other similar plan; provided,
however, that notwithstanding 



 

48 anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may (i) amend the
Rights Plan solely for the purpose of extending the Distribution Date
thereunder to that time immediately prior to the consummation of an
unsolicited exchange or tender offer by a third party and (ii) take any action
in connection with the Rights Plan that is required by order of a court
of competent jurisdiction. The Company shall contest any claim, action or
proceeding, seeking to require the Company to take action with respect to the
Rights Plan.

stockholders of Parent):



(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



(b) by either Parent or the Company if a judgment, injunction, order or decree
of a court or other competent Governmental Authority enjoining Parent or the
Company from consummating the Mergers shall have been entered and such
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall have become final and
nonappealable;



(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Mergers shall not have been

_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure or whose
affiliates failure to perform any covenant or obligation under this
Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Mergers to occur on or before such date;



(d) by Parent or the Company if at the Company Shareholders Meeting (including
any adjournment or postponement thereof) the requisite vote of
the shareholders of the Company to approve the Mergers, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have been obtained; provided
that a party may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this subsection if
the failure to obtain such shareholders approval has been principally caused
by or resulted from its or its affiliates action or failure to act and such
action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement.



 

51 (e) by Parent or the Company if there shall have been a material breach by the
other of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure to
satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b)
(in the case of a breach by Parent) or Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) (in the case
of a breach by the Company), and such breach, if it is of a nature that it may
be cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days after notice thereof shall
have been received by the party alleged to be in breach; 



(f) by Parent if, before the Company Shareholders Meeting, (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof shall have withdrawn or
modified, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation;
(ii) the Company shall have failed to include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of the

or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company in excess of 20% of

ten business days after such tender or exchange offer is first published, sent
or given, a statement disclosing that the Companys Board of Directors
recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer; or



(g) By the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company has approved a
Superior Proposal; provided that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this subsection unless it has complied with Section

7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement, except for this Section
7.2, the provisions of the second sentence of Section 5.3(f) and Sections
7.3, 8.7 and 8.10, shall become void and have no effect, without any liability
on the part of any party or its directors, officers, shareholders or
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.2 shall
relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for a breach of any
provision of this Agreement.



7.3. _Termination Fee; Expenses_.



(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section
7.1(f); (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(g); or (iii) pursuant to Section 7.1(d)
in the event (A) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, a Competing
Transaction shall have been made known to the Company, and the fact of such
Competing Transaction shall have become publicly known or shall have been made
directly to the shareholders of the Company generally, and such Competing
Transaction shall not have been withdrawn and (B) within 9 months of such



 

52 termination, the Company consummates a Company Acquisition (as defined below),
then in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee
equal to $15.8 million. " _Company Acquisition_ " means (x) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction
involving the Company as a result of which the voting securities of the
Company owned by the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to
consummation of such transaction are converted into voting securities in the
aggregate that do not constitute a majority of voting securities of the
entity surviving or resulting from such transaction (or the ultimate parent
entity thereof), (y) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of
a majority of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in a single transaction or series of transactions or (z) the
acquisition, by a person (other than Parent or any affiliate thereof or any
person with respect to which the voting securities of the Company immediately
prior to such acquisition shall have been converted into a majority of such
persons voting securities immediately after such acquisition) or group (as
such term is defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of beneficial ownership of more than the a majority
of the Company Common Stock, in either case whether by tender or exchange
offer or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 7.3(a), the term "Competing
Transaction" shall be deemed to substitute "a majority" in place of each
instance of the term "15%" therein in the case of clause (y) and "85%" therein
in the case of clauses (x) and (z).



(b) The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be
paid pursuant to this Section 7.3 regardless of any alleged breach,
other than a willful or intentional breach, by Parent of its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , that no payment made by the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.3 shall operate or be construed as a waiver by the Company of any
breach of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub or LLC or of any rights of the
Company in respect thereof.



(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
7.3 shall be made to the Parent not later than two business days after
delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment, or, if earlier, upon
the consummation of a Company Acquisition if such payment is required pursuant
to Section 7.3(a)(ii) or 7.3(a)(iii), and shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent.



7.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after adoption of this Agreement by stockholders of Parent or
the Company, but after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by
law requires further approval or authorization by the stockholders of Parent
or the Company without such further approval or authorization. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.



7.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent
(with respect to the Company) and the Company (with respect to Parent) by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of such party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party.
