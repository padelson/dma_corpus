that Buyer and Seller were unable to resolve during the Resolution Period. The
Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on the written submissions
and oral presentations by Seller and Buyer and their
respective representatives and not by independent review. The Accounting Firm

Firm shall either accept the position taken by Buyer or the position taken by
Seller, but the Accounting Firm shall not make another determination of the
disputed item, and that the Accounting Firm shall, based solely on its
determination of the disputed items, prepare and deliver to Seller and Buyer
the Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Date Working Capital and

determination of each of the Closing Date Working Capital and Purchase Price
shall be final, conclusive and binding. All negotiations pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(b)_ shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations

enforce any decision under this _Section 2.5(b)_. The other partys only
defense to such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall
be fraud or manifest error by or upon the Accounting Firm. Absent such fraud
or error, such other party shall reimburse the party seeking enforcement for
its expenses related to such enforcement. The cost of any arbitration
(including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm) pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(b)_ shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at
the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of
the matters submitted. For the avoidance of doubt and solely as an
illustration of the methodology set forth in the preceding sentence, if (i)
the Objection Statement delivered by Seller assigns values to the disputed
matters such that the Working Capital set forth in the Buyer Closing Statement
would be increased by $1,000,000, (ii) Buyer maintains that the Working
Capital set forth in the Buyer Closing Statement is correct and (iii) the
Accounting Firms final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with
this _Section 2.5(b)_ is that the Working Capital is increased from the
amount set forth in the Buyer Closing Statement by $600,000 ( _i.e._ , sixty
percent (60%) of the amount in dispute is resolved in favor of Seller), then
Seller shall be responsible for forty percent (40%) of such cost of
arbitration and Buyer shall be responsible for sixty percent (60%) of such
cost of arbitration. Except as provided in the

 



22  two preceding sentences, the fees and disbursements of Buyers independent
accountants incurred in connection with their review of the Buyer Closing
Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Statement and any Objection Statement shall
be borne by Buyer, and the fees and disbursements of Sellers independent
accountants incurred in connection with their review of the Buyer Closing
Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Statement and any Objection Statement shall
be paid by Seller. Each of Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with and assist
the Accounting Firm to resolve disputed items, including by making available
and granting reasonable access to records and employees. The Purchase Price
as finally determined by (i) failure of Seller to object to the Buyer Closing
Statement, (ii) agreement of Seller and Buyer, or (iii) the Accounting Firm,
shall be the "Final Purchase Price."

 

(c) Within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Purchase Price in accordance with  _Section 2.5(b)_: (i) if the Final
Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay,
or cause the Company to pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, cash in an amount equal to such excess; and (ii) if the
Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall
pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an
amount equal to the amount of such deficit. If the Final Purchase Price is
equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be
required to make any payment. In the event any amounts due under this _Section
2.5(c)_ are not paid when due, such amounts shall bear interest from such
due date until paid at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition on the Closing Date.

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 2.5_, the Preliminary Closing
Statement, the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet, the Buyer Closing Statement,
the Buyer Closing Balance Sheet and the determinations and calculations
contained therein (including any determination of Working Capital) shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with US GAAP and, to the extent
consistent with US GAAP, using the same accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods (with consistent classifications,
inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and
applied by Seller in the preparation of Sellers consolidated financial
statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in that
certain Annual Report on Form 10-K on March 3, 2014 (collectively, the
"Balance Sheet Principles").

 

(e) During the period of time from and after the delivery of the Buyer Closing
Statement through the date of the determination of the Final Purchase Price
(in accordance with this _Section 2.5_), Buyer shall afford, and shall cause
the Company to afford, to Seller and the accountants, counsel and financial
advisers retained by Seller in connection with the determination of such
Final Purchase Price reasonable access during normal business hours, and upon
reasonable prior notice, to all financial information, books and records and
accounting personnel in each case of the Company and the
Continuing Subsidiaries, requested by Seller, to the extent such requests
made by Seller or Sellers accountants, counsel and financial advisers are
relevant to the determinations contemplated by this _Section 2.5_.

 



23 2.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Transfer Taxes relating directly to the sale and
transfer of the Membership Interests, including any Transfer Taxes resulting
from the treatment of any portion of the sale and transfer of the Membership
Interests as an asset sale for tax purposes, shall be borne by Buyer, and
Buyer shall, at its own expense, properly file on a timely basis all
necessary Tax Returns, reports, forms and other documentation with respect to
any such Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes arising out of or relating to the
Transfer and any other reorganization effectuated by Seller and
its Affiliates, shall be borne by Seller, and Seller shall, at its own
expense, properly file on a timely basis all necessary Tax Returns, reports,
forms and other documentation with respect to any such Transfer Taxes.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). There are no pending, or to

Company nor any Continuing Subsidiary has received from any counterparty to
any Material Contract, in connection with such Material Contract (A) any

confidential know-how of such Persons, have executed and delivered to such
Persons, as applicable, an agreement assigning to such Persons their entire
right, title and interest in and to such Intellectual Property (except to the

43  payment by Company or a Continuing Subsidiary in excess of $100,000), and
lists all agreements involving an annual payment by Company or a Continuing
Subsidiary in excess of $100,000 granting rights to use such Intellectual
Property (the "Company IP Agreements"). The Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries have made available to Buyer correct and complete copies of the
Company IP Agreements (as amended to date).

 

(i) _Section 3.16(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists all agreements
pursuant to which the Company or any Continuing Subsidiary has granted any

of the Disclosure Schedule along with the Company IP Agreements shall be
deemed a "Material Contract" for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(j) Each item of Company Intellectual Property will be owned or available for
use, as applicable, by the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries, on
identical terms or without loss or impairment of material rights following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as such items were owned
or available for use by the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries prior to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the
execution, delivery and performance by Seller, the Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries nor the consummation of any transactions contemplated
hereby shall result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any right
of a third party to terminate, any material rights of the Company or any
Continuing Subsidiary in any such Company Intellectual Property.

 

(k) All material computer software and systems, information technology
equipment, and associated documentation that are used by the Company or the

not materially malfunctioned or failed since December 31, 2010 _, and_ do not
contain any viruses, bugs, vulnerabilities, faults or other devices or effects
that could (i) enable or assist any Person to access without authorization the
IT Assets or any information in the IT Assets, or (ii) otherwise
significantly adversely affect the functionality of the IT Assets, except as
disclosed in their documentation. To Sellers Knowledge, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to any IT Assets. The Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries (directly or via third party providers) have implemented
reasonable backup, security and disaster recovery technology, plans,
procedures and facilities with respect to the IT Assets, consistent with
industry practices.

(l) Except as specifically described in _Section 3.16(l)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries have not

imposes or could reasonably impose any material limitation, restriction or
condition on the right of such Persons to use or distribute any of their
products or services or that requires or could reasonably require the
distribution of any material Company-Owned Intellectual Property. With

Subsidiary, such Person has been and is in compliance in all respects
with all applicable Open Source Software licenses with respect thereto.

 



44 (m) Except as specifically described in _Section 3.16(m)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, no source code of Company-Owned Software has been licensed or

material Company-Owned Intellectual Property was developed either exclusively
or partially with funds from a Governmental Authority. The U.S. Government has
acquired no more than "limited rights" or "restricted rights" as defined in
FAR Parts 27 and 52 and/or DFARS Parts 227 and 252 in any Company
Intellectual Property that was a deliverable under a contract with a

each appoint a major internationally-renowned valuation firm and the two
appointed valuation firms shall agree upon and appoint a third major
internationally-renowned valuation firm, which third valuation firm shall
determine the FMV in accordance with this sentence.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates be required to, nor shall any of the

or, subject only to _Section 5.1(a)(ii)_, concede anything of value, (B)
subject only to _Section 5.1(a)(ii)_, sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold

could reasonably limit Buyers, its Affiliates, the Companys or the
Company Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to
retain, one or more businesses, product lines or assets, (C) subject only to
_Section 5.1(a)(ii)_, terminate, modify or extend any existing relationships
and contractual rights and obligations of the Business or Buyer or its
Affiliates, (D) establish or create any relationships and contractual rights
and obligations of the Business or Buyer or its Affiliates, other than a

Governmental Authority) or (G) litigate (or defend) against any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding (including any proceeding
seeking a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction) challenging
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Law. In addition, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be permitted to acquire any
equity interest in, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, merge,
consolidate, enter into a share exchange or business combination with,
or enter into any other similar transaction or series of transactions with,
any Person and the parties agree that no such transaction shall be a breach of
this _Section 5.1(a)_.

 

(b) _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, and except as set
forth in _Section 5.1(a)_, prior to the Closing, Buyer, the Company and
Seller shall promptly cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to: (A)
diligently and expeditiously take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
actions, and to make, or cause to be made, all filings necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (B) to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
Consents of Governmental Authorities and other Persons with respect to any
Material Contract or Permit, or as set forth on _Section 3.5_ of the
Disclosure Schedule as are necessary to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transitional Services
Agreement; and (C) to fulfill the conditions to consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the

 



53  Transitional Services Agreement. Following the Closing, as and when
requested by any party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Transitional Services Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, from and
after the Closing (A) Seller shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) do all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and as reasonably
requested by Buyer to (1) other than those assets provided pursuant to the
Transitional Services Agreement, put Buyer in effective possession, ownership
and control of the assets of the Business (including without limitation
all assets, services, properties, goodwill, Intellectual Property, data and
rights described in the first sentence of _Section 3.13(d)_), and Buyer shall
cooperate with Seller for such purpose and (2) subject to  _Section
5.1(b)(ii)_, assure that Seller, rather than Buyer or its Affiliates, is the
obligor in respect of all Transferred Liabilities, including by retaining or
expressly assuming, as applicable, all such Liabilities and discharging

advisable under applicable Law as reasonably requested by Seller (1) to
transfer to Seller any assets not related to the Business that may remain in
the Company or the Continuing Subsidiaries and (2) subject to _Section
5.1(b)(ii)_, to assure that the Company or the Continuing Subsidiaries, rather
than Seller or its Affiliates, is the obligor in respect of all Liabilities
related to the Business (but only to the extent included in the Buyer Closing
Balance Sheet (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_) or to the
extent arising after the Closing) other than the Transferred Liabilities, and
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer for such purposes.

(ii) In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, each party hereto
shall promptly consult with the other parties to this Agreement with respect
to, provide any necessary information with respect to, and in the case of
correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies of all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Authority or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties
to this Agreement of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transitional Services Agreement. If any party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate of such parties receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transitional Services
Agreement, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause
to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to this
Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Any
disclosure or communication between the parties pursuant to this paragraph
shall be made in a manner that protects attorney-client or attorney work
product privilege.

 

(iii) Without limiting the foregoing, if at any time after the date hereof,
any party discovers any Business Assets that were not transferred to the
Company or any Continuing Subsidiary, or any Transferred Assets or Transferred
Liabilities that were not transferred to the Seller, in each case at or prior
to the Closing, each party shall, at Sellers sole expense, execute and
deliver to the other party such documents and take such further action as
such other party may reasonably request in order to give effect to the
transactions contemplated

 



54  by this Agreement, the Transitional Services Agreement and the Transitional
License Agreement, including without limitation to do all things necessary,
proper or advisable, and as reasonably requested, to put Buyer in effective
possession, ownership and control of the Business Assets, to put Seller in
effective possession, ownership and control of the Transferred Assets and
assure that Seller is the obligor in respect of all Transferred Liabilities,
in each case at no additional cost to Buyer, the Company or any Continuing
Subsidiary.

(iv) In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall promptly provide to Buyer,
the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries any information deemed reasonably
necessary by Buyer, the Company or any Continuing Subsidiary with respect to
any subsequent FDA regulatory filings relating to the Business as presently
conducted or proposed to be conducted. In the event of any communication from
FDA regarding any regulatory filings for products used in connection with the
Business, whether such communication is delivered via FDA inspection or
inspectional observations, enforcement actions, or informal communications,
Seller will make available to Buyer, the Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries such resources and institutional knowledge as reasonably
requested to assist Buyer, the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries in
complying with any FDA actions and preparing any necessary or desirable FDA
regulatory filings. The obligations contained in this paragraph shall survive
the Closing for a period of five (5) years.

5.3 _Exclusivity_. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Seller
and the Company shall, and shall cause each Seller Party and the respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other agents of Seller, the Company, the Continuing Subsidiaries, each other
Seller Party and each of their Affiliates (collectively, "Representatives")
to cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any action that would
constitute an Acquisition Proposal and shall notify each such Person that it,
or any Affiliate, officer, director, investment advisor, financial advisor,
attorney or other representative retained by it, no longer seeks or requests
the making of any Acquisition Proposal, and, if permitted, withdraws any
Consent theretofore given to the making of an Acquisition Proposal. No Seller
Party shall, directly or indirectly, and each Seller Party and their
Affiliates shall cause their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or conduct any discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to or otherwise cooperate in any other way with, or
facilitate or encourage any effort to attempt to, or enter into any agreement
or understanding with, any Person or group of Persons regarding any

Business Days) notify Buyer of the receipt by any Seller Party, their
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives of any inquiries, or
proposals or requests for information concerning an Acquisition Proposal. The
foregoing restrictions shall not apply to (i) any sale of stock or other
equity interests in the Seller, (ii) a merger,

 



58  consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or any other similar

any other sale or disposition of the Transferred Subsidiaries or Transferred
Assets.

5.4 _Business Operation_. Nothing contained herein shall give to Buyer,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company, any
Continuing Subsidiary, any assets related to the Business or the Business
prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, each Seller Party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions hereof, complete control and
supervision of any assets related to the Business and the Business, as
applicable.

 

5.5 _Access and Information_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller and the
Company shall, and shall cause each Continuing Subsidiary and other Seller
Party (with respect to the Business) to, (i) afford Buyer, its counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, other authorized representatives and their
representatives, in each case, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws), reasonable access,
upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours to each of their
executive personnel, properties, Material Contracts, books and records,
and other documents and data; in a manner that does not materially disrupt
the business or operations of such Persons, and (ii) otherwise provide such
assistance as is reasonably requested by Buyer so that Buyer may have a full
opportunity to make such investigation and evaluation as it shall reasonably
desire to make of the Business. In addition, each of Seller and the Company
shall, and shall cause each Continuing Subsidiary to, cooperate fully
(including providing introductions where necessary) with Buyer to enable
Buyer to contact such third parties, including customers, prospective
customers, specifying agencies, vendors or suppliers of the Business, as Buyer
reasonably deems necessary.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date until the seventh (7th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause each Continuing
Subsidiary to afford Seller, its counsel, accountants, financial advisors,
other authorized representatives and their representatives, reasonable
access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours to each
of their executive personnel, properties, books and records, and other
documents and data for the periods up to and including the Closing Date, in a
manner that does not materially disrupt the business or operations of such
Persons, to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Seller to prepare its
financial statements and tax returns for the period through the Closing Date
and to defend itself against any audit or investigation conducted by a
Governmental Authority. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall furnish to
Buyer, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of each calendar month,
the monthly financial information described in _Section 5.5(b)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (without reference to any specific customer information).

 

(c) Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective landlords,

conducted, assessments of all offices, improvements, buildings and all real
property and related facilities used by the Business or owned or leased
by the Company or the Continuing Subsidiaries.

exchange on which any security of any of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Affiliates are listed or traded, (a) the content of the initial
press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be determined
by Seller, but Seller shall give Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the portions of such press release related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and Seller shall consider in good faith
all such comments and (b) Seller and Buyer shall each use reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing, and provide each other
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any other press
release or otherwise making any other public statement with respect to

that the foregoing restrictions shall not relate to any statements or
disclosures in relation to any dispute among the parties regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to issue the initial press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof.

 

5.7 _Confidential Information_. During the 5-year period following the Closing
Date, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, excludes the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries
for purposes of this _Section 5.7_) to, keep confidential the Confidential
Information. If Seller or a Seller Affiliate is legally compelled (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, such Person shall notify Buyer promptly
of such event so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in
the absence of a protective order, Seller or any Seller Affiliate is, on the
advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any
Governmental Authority or else stand liable for contempt, such Person may
disclose the Confidential Information, only to the extent so compelled. Seller
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliate to, keep confidential any trade
secrets the Company, the Continuing Subsidiaries or the Business for as long
as such trade secret qualifies as a trade secret under applicable federal,
state or local Law.

5.8 _Accounts Receivable_. If, on or after the Closing Date, Buyer receives
payment on any accounts receivable that are Transferred Assets, either in
whole or in part, Buyer shall transmit the portion of such funds that
constitute Transferred Assets to Seller within five (5) Business Days of
Buyers receipt thereof. If, on or after the Closing Date, Seller receives
payment on any accounts receivable that are assets of the Business, either in
whole or in part, Seller shall transmit the portion of such funds that
constitute assets of the Business to Buyer within five (5) Business Days of
Sellers receipt thereof.

5.9 _Transitional License Agreement_. The Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries will not, except as expressly provided for in and subject to the
explicit terms of the Transitional License Agreement to be entered into
between Seller and the Company in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit I_
(the "Transitional License Agreement") have any rights to use the names
"Alere", "Alere Health", "Alere Health Improvement", "Alere Womens and
Childrens Health", and the Alere logo, which shall be available only on a
transitional basis. No provision of this Section 5.9 is intended to, nor shall
any provision of this Section 5.9 be deemed or construed to, provide any
right, title, interest, license, remedy or claim to any third party in, to,
under or as a result of the use of the name "Alere" pursuant to this Section
5.9.

Agreement, the Transfer or the Transitional License Agreement, (b) unpaid
compensation, benefits, expense reimbursements or similar matters relating to
compensation of such Person, (c) any Liabilities arising solely out of
commercial relationships between any Releasor, on the one hand, and any
Releasee, on the other hand, that are unrelated to the Business, and (d) any
existing indemnification obligations, including under any Persons
Organizational Documents or pursuant to any directors and officers liability
insurance policy. Effective upon the Closing, each Releasor shall not and, to
the extent within such Releasors control, shall cause its corporate or other
entity Affiliates (including, in the case of Seller, the Transferred
Subsidiaries and in the case of Buyer, the Company and the Continuing

after the Closing (the "Restriction Period"), that such Restricted Person
shall not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written Consent of Buyer,

over-the-counter market shall not constitute a breach of this _Section
5.11(a)_. Further, if, after the date hereof, a Restricted Person shall
directly or indirectly acquire another Person that competes against Buyer, the
Company or a Continuing Subsidiary in any aspect of the Business, no violation
of this _Section 5.11(a)_ shall occur unless (1) the majority of
the revenues of the acquired Person are derived from the Business, or (2) if
less than a majority of the revenue of the acquired Person is derived from the
Business, the Restricted Person shall not have, in compliance with Buyers
right of first offer, disposed of or ceased operating the portion of the
acquired Person engaged in the Business within twelve (12) months after the
date of acquisition (a "Competing Disposition"). During the permitted
twelve (12) month holding period of a Competing Disposition, no Restricted

 



62 Person shall incorporate any portion of such Competing Disposition into its
business or utilize any of the know-how, expertise or Intellectual Property
of the Competing Disposition in the operation of its business. If the
Restricted Person proposes to engage in a Competing Disposition, the
Restricted Person shall first deliver a written offer to Buyer of such
Competing Disposition (the "ROFO Notice"). Buyer shall have the exclusive
right, for a period of ninety (90) days from receipt of the ROFO Notice (the
"Buyer Notice Period") to present a proposal relating to an acquisition of
the Competing Disposition. During the Buyer Notice Period, the Restricted
Person shall provide to Buyer such due diligence information as is reasonably
requested, and shall reasonably cooperate and negotiate with Buyer in good
faith. No Restricted Person shall notify, discuss, negotiate or provide any
due diligence information to any potential acquiror, directly or indirectly,
of the Competing Disposition during the Buyer Notice Period. No
Restricted Person shall enter into any agreement (including, but not limited
to, any exclusivity agreement or no-shop agreement that precludes a
transaction or discussions with Buyer, or a binding term sheet) providing for
or relating to a Competing Disposition prior to the expiration of the Buyer
Notice Period.

(b) Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that the assets (including
Intellectual Property) of the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries and after giving effect to the
Transfer), including the assets of the Other Businesses and of Alere
Informatics and Alere Home Monitoring, were developed independently of and do
not use or incorporate any Business Assets.

(c) No Restricted Person shall, during the two (2) year period from and after
the Closing, without the prior written Consent of Buyer, (i) directly or
indirectly attempt to hire away any then-current employee of the Company or
any Continuing Subsidiary (other than by means of advertisements directed
toward the general public) or (ii) hire or persuade any such employee to leave
employment with the Company or any Continuing Subsidiary (other than by means
of advertisements directed toward the general public).

(d) Seller acknowledges that it would be difficult to fully compensate Buyer
or any of its Affiliates for Losses resulting from any breach of the
provisions of this _Section 5.11_. Accordingly, in the event of any actual or
threatened breach of such provisions, Buyer and its Affiliates shall (in
addition to any other remedies which it may have) be entitled to temporary or
permanent injunctive relief to enforce such provisions without the necessity
of proving actual Losses or the inadequacy of money Losses, or posting bond.
Seller further acknowledges that the geographic boundaries, scope of
prohibited activities and the time duration of the provisions of this _Section
5.11_ are reasonable and are no broader than are necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Buyer including the ability of Buyer to
realize the benefit of its bargain and enjoy the goodwill of the Business.
Seller further acknowledges that this _Section 5.11_ constitutes a material
inducement to Buyer to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and Buyer will be relying on the enforceability of this _Section
5.11_ in completing such transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



63 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the restrictions placed on any
Restricted Person in this _Section 5.11_ shall not apply to any bona fide
acquirer for value of a Restricted Person that is unaffiliated with Seller (a
"Subsequent Owner"), or to the Restricted Person (provided the Restricted
Person is not Seller), in the event of (i) any sale of stock or other equity
interests amounting to a majority interest of such Restricted Person, or (ii)
a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or any other
similar transaction involving the Restricted Person, so long as, in any event,
(I) such Subsequent Owner does not use the mark " _Alere_ " or "
_Alere Health_ " in connection with any Competing Services during the
Restriction Period and (II) the Restricted Person holds no Business Assets.

5.12  _Books and Records_. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall have either
(i) delivered or caused to be delivered to Buyer the organizational records,
minute books and governance records of the Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries, or (ii) caused all such materials to be in the possession and
control of the Company such that, as of immediately following the Closing,
Buyer shall have full access to and control of such materials.

 

5.13 _Transfer; Transitional License Agreement_. At or prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller Parties shall effectuate the Transfer and enter into
the Transitional License Agreement.

5.14 _D andO Insurance_. Seller hereby represents and warrants that the
directors and officers of the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries are
currently insured under the Sellers existing directors and officers
liability insurance policies, which are set forth on _Section 3.20_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, and shall continue to be so insured immediately
following the Closing for actions taken as directors or officers of the
Company or the Continuing Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Seller shall not
take any action to change or cancel, or permit the change or cancellation of,
such insurance coverage with respect thereto for the six (6) years following
the Closing unless Seller shall procure, in connection with such change, a
tail insurance policy covering such directors and officers for a period of
time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing.

5.15 _Agreements with Respect to Employee Benefits_.

(a) Effective immediately prior to Closing, Seller shall take all necessary
steps to allow access to its medical plan, dental plan, vision plan and
health and dependent care reimbursed plans to allow employees of the Company
and the Continuing Subsidiaries to continue participating in such plans until
the latest of (i) December 31, 2014, (ii) the date that is the last day of
the calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs, or (iii) for a period of
thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing Date.

 

(b) Seller shall cause all employees of the Company and the Continuing
Subsidiaries with outstanding advance payments from Seller prior to Closing
to repay Seller in full for such payments.

(c) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all
necessary actions prior to the Closing to ensure that, after the Closing,
employees of the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries do not experience a
lapse or gap in employee benefits and that the Company and the
Continuing Subsidiaries do not experience a lapse or gap in related stop-loss
insurance policies.

 



64 5.16 _Patent Rights_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to: (i) assert any Action or (ii) render assistance
to any Person in connection with the assertion of an Action, in each case
under clauses (i) and (ii) against a Non-Assert Beneficiary under any Seller
Patent with respect to the conduct of the Business, solely to the extent that
(1) the Business engaged in such conduct in the same manner as of or prior to
Closing and (2) such conduct as engaged in as of or prior to Closing would
have infringed a Seller Patent absent Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries
being Sellers Affiliates or an authorization (express or implied) to practice
under the patent.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to: (i) assert any Action or (ii) render assistance
to any Person in connection with the assertion of an Action, in each case
under clauses (i) and (ii), against Seller or any of its direct or indirect
Affiliates, or any assignee, successor, transferee, distributor, or
commercial partner thereof under any Business Patent; provided, however, that
nothing in this _Section 5.16(b)_ shall in any way limit the scope of the
non-compete covenants set forth in _Section 5.11_.

 

5.17 _Professional Liability Claims_. In connection with any written claim for
professional liability received by the Company or any Continuing Subsidiary
for incurrences prior to the Closing that are Transferred Liabilities, each of
Buyer and the Company agrees that it shall provide Seller prompt notice of
such claim; provided, that Buyer, the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries
shall not be in breach of this covenant to the extent that any such notice
does not have a materially prejudicial effect on the rights available to
Seller with respect to such claim. Seller shall control the defense and
settlement of any such claim.

 

ARTICLE VI

_TAX MATTERS_

6.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all (i) Tax Returns of, or that include, the Company or any Continuing
Subsidiary or any of their respective assets or operations for any Pre-Closing
Tax Periods that end on or before the Closing Date and (ii) any Tax Returns
with respect to Seller Combined Taxes. Seller shall control the determination
of whether any transaction with respect to a Corporate Continuing Subsidiary
that occurs on the Closing Date is properly allocable to the portion of such
Corporate Continuing Subsidiarys day after the Closing under the "next day
rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). Buyer shall cause
the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries to timely execute and deliver such
authorizations, Consents, or powers of attorney as shall be reasonably
requested by Seller

 



65  to permit Seller to file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns that Seller
is required to file, or cause to be filed, pursuant to this _Section 6.1(a)_
and that are filed after the Closing Date. Seller will deliver to Buyer a
copy of each such Tax Return filed after the Closing Date that is a Separate
Return of the Company or a Continuing Subsidiary at least fourteen (14) days
(five (5) days for any such Tax Return relating to sales or use Taxes) prior
to filing and will consider all reasonable comments made by Buyer with respect
thereto. Seller shall remit to the appropriate Taxing Authority the amount of
Taxes shown as payable on such Tax Return at the time Seller files (or causes
to be filed) such Tax Return with the appropriate Taxing Authority.

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Straddle Period Tax Returns that are Separate Returns of the
Company and any Continuing Subsidiary that are filed after the Closing Date.
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes thereon or otherwise imposed
with respect to such Straddle Period; provided, however, that Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for any portion of such Taxes that are Pre-Closing Straddle
Period Taxes as defined in _Section 6.1(c)_. All Straddle Period Tax Returns
described in this _Section 6.1(b)_ shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past practice of Seller, the Company or a Continuing Subsidiary, as
applicable (except to the extent there is no reasonable basis therefor, or a
change in Law or fact). Buyer will deliver to Seller a copy of each such
Straddle Period Tax Return at least fourteen (14) days (five (5) days for any
such Straddle Period Tax Returns of the Company or Continuing Subsidiary that
are filed with respect to sales or use Taxes) prior to filing and will
consider all comments made by Seller with respect thereto in good faith. Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for any Post-Closing Straddle Period Taxes (as defined
in Section 6.1(c)) with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Returns that are
Separate Returns of the Company and any Continuing Subsidiary that are filed
on or before the Closing Date, except to the extent any payments by Seller are
reflected as a Current Asset in the Closing Date Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_.

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are
payable with respect to a Straddle Period Tax Return described in _Section
6.1(b)_, the amount of such Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes") shall
(i) in the case of Taxes other than income, profit, gains, sales and use and
withholding Taxes be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number
of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which shall be the number of days in the entire Tax period; and
(ii) in the case of income, profit, gains, sales and use and withholding
Taxes be determined from the books and records of the Company or Continuing
Subsidiary, as applicable, as though the taxable year of the Company or such
Continuing Subsidiary, as applicable, terminated at the close of business on
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, "Post-Closing Straddle
Period Taxes" shall mean Taxes with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Return
described in _Section 6.1(b)_ that are attributable to the portion of any
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date. Transfer Taxes shall be
addressed as provided in _Section 2.6_.

 



66 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article VI_ to the contrary,
Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any Taxes reflected as a
Current Liability in the Closing Date Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.5_.

 

6.2 _Cooperation and Assistance_. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates, directors, managers, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and other representatives to reasonably cooperate,
in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all Tax Claims with
respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, including by maintaining
and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with
Taxes and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to
testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

6.3 _Tax Claims_.

 

(a) After the Closing, each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of any
Tax Claims with respect to damages for which Seller could be liable pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

(b) Seller will control the defense of all Tax Claims relating to Taxes or Tax
Returns within the scope of  _Section 6.1(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) Buyer and its counsel (at Buyers expense) may participate in (but not
control the conduct of) the defense of any such Tax Claim that relates to a
Separate Return of a Continuing Subsidiary, and (ii) Seller may not settle or
compromise any such Tax Claim covered by the preceding clause (i) without the
Consent of Buyer, which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and (iii) to the extent Seller fails to use
commercially reasonable efforts to control or defend any such Tax Claim, as
determined by a Tax Arbitrator (selected in the manner described in _Section
6.4_), any reasonable cost or expense borne by Buyer to control or defend
such Tax Claim is subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(viii)_. Buyer will control, without affecting its or any other
Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification under this Agreement, the
defense of all other Tax Claims relating to the Company, any of its assets, or
any of its operations (including the Continuing Subsidiaries); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and its counsel (at the expense of Seller) may
participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense of any such Tax
Claim with respect to a Straddle Period, and, _provided_ , _further_ , that
Buyer may not settle or compromise any such Tax Claim with respect to any
Straddle Period without the Consent of Seller, which Consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.4 _Dispute Resolution for Tax Matters_. With respect to any dispute,
controversy or claim relating to Taxes between Buyer and the Company (prior to
the Closing), or between Buyer and Seller (for any Tax for which an indemnity
claim may exist), Buyer and the Company or Seller, as applicable, shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute, controversy or claim between
them for a period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice of such
dispute, controversy or claim is received by Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be; but if the applicable parties are unable to resolve such dispute,
controversy or claim, the parties shall submit the dispute, controversy or
claim for resolution, which resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties, to the

 



67  Accounting Firm or a mutually agreed upon tax lawyer who is: (a) a partner
in a law firm, (b) familiar with transactions or operations of the sort at
issue; and (c) independent with respect to each party (the Accounting Firm or
such tax lawyer, the "Tax Arbitrator"). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the fees and expenses of the Tax Arbitrator
relating to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed shall be paid by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in proportion to each
partys respective liability for the portion of the Taxes in dispute, as
determined by the Tax Arbitrator; provided that the liability of Buyer for
the portion of the Taxes in dispute shall be deemed to include, for purposes
of this calculation, any reduction in Sellers liability relative to the
amount in dispute.

 

6.5 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Company or any Continuing Subsidiary shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
and any Continuing Subsidiary shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to commercially
reasonable agreements providing for the allocation or payment of real
property Taxes with respect to real property leased by any Continuing
Subsidiary and commercially reasonable agreements not primarily related to
Taxes entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business providing for the
allocation or payment of personal property Taxes.

6.6 _Amendments, Modifications, etc_. For the avoidance of doubt, after the
Closing Buyer, its Affiliates, the Company and any Continuing Subsidiary shall
not amend, modify or otherwise change any Tax Return of the Company or any
Continuing Subsidiary relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the
Consent of Seller, such Consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

6.7 _Refunds or Credits_. To the extent Buyer, the Company or any Continuing
Subsidiary receives a refund or credit for Taxes with respect to the Company
or any Continuing Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Buyer shall
cause the amount of such refund or credit (net of any Tax thereon) to be paid
to Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt.

6.8 _Carrybacks_. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Buyer agrees not to
carryback any losses of any Corporate Continuing Subsidiaries to any Pre-
Closing Tax Periods of such Corporate Continuing Subsidiaries, including by
making or causing to be made an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B).

 

6.9 _Section 1502-36 Election_. If necessary in order to prevent the
reduction of U.S. federal income Tax asset basis or other U.S. federal
income Tax attributes of the Corporate Continuing Subsidiaries, Seller will
file or cause to be filed a "Section 1.1502-36 Statement" (as defined in
Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-36(e)(5)) with the timely filed U.S. federal consolidated
income tax return for the consolidated group of which Seller is a member for
the consolidated tax return year that includes the Closing Date making an
election to reduce the tax basis, pursuant to Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A), in shares of any Corporate Continuing Subsidiaries
immediately before the transfer to Buyer (the "Section 1.1502-36 Election").
To the extent permitted by Law, and provided it is consistent with the
election described above, Seller will make or cause to be made similar
elections for purposes of the alternative minimum tax imposed under the Code.
Seller further agrees to take all other such actions as may be required to
give effect to such Section 1.1502-36 Election. Seller will deliver or cause
any of its Affiliates to deliver a copy of the

 



68  Section 1.1502-36 Statement to Buyer as soon as practicable following the
filing of Sellers U.S. federal consolidated Tax Return for the consolidated
tax return year that includes the Closing Date. The Section 1.1502-36
Statement will include all of the requirements as set forth in Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-36(e)(5)(viii) and Seller and any of its Affiliates shall not take any
action which could reasonably be expected to result in a revocation of the
Section 1.1502-36 Election.

6.10 _Tax Covenants_. Buyer covenants that it will not cause or permit the
Company, any Continuing Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Buyer (i) to take any
action after the Closing on the Closing Date other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business, including but not limited to the distribution of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption that could give rise to any Tax Liability
or reduce any Tax asset of Seller, any Affiliate of Seller, the Company or any
Continuing Subsidiary, (ii) to make any election or deemed election under
Section 338 or Section 336(e) of the Code (or any comparable election under
other Law), or (iii) to make or change any Tax election that, in the case of
each of (i)-(iii), could result in any increased Tax Liability or reduction of
any Tax asset of the Seller, any Affiliate of Seller, the Company or any
Continuing Subsidiary in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) to
request from any Taxing Authority the documents described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-77(b) (or any similar documents with respect to any
state, local or foreign jurisdiction). The parties covenant that, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) any Tax deduction resulting
from the payment of any Transaction Expenses, the payment of which is not
contingent immediately following the Closing (except for any retention
payments payable following the Closing), will be taken by Seller or any
Affiliate thereof, and not Buyer or any Affiliate thereof and (ii) any Tax
deduction resulting from the payment of any Transaction Expenses, the payment
of which is contingent immediately following the Closing (including any
retention payments payable following the Closing), will be taken by Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, and not Buyer or any Affiliate thereof, but only to
the extent such deduction can be taken by Seller or its Affiliates without
commercially unreasonable efforts or undue burden on the part of Buyer or its
Affiliates, which such commercially unreasonable efforts shall include, but
not be limited to, the filing of any amended Tax Return by Buyer or its
Affiliates.

6.11 _Tax Allocation_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets
of the Purchased LLC Entities in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder and consistent with the methodology set
forth at _Exhibit F_ (the "Allocation") _. _The parties agree that the total
amount of the Purchase Price to be allocated to the assets of the Company
(excluding the amount allocable to the stock, membership interests and/or
assets of the Continuing Subsidiaries) and to the assets of Alere Womens and
Childrens Health, LLC, will be in the Valuation Range and, consistent with
the Valuation Range, that they will use reasonable best efforts to agree on an
allocation of the applicable portion of the Purchase Price by the Closing
Date to each of (i) the total amount of the assets of the Company (excluding
the amount allocable to the stock, membership interests and/or assets of the
Continuing Subsidiaries) and (ii) Alere Womens and Childrens Health, LLC.
__ Seller shall deliver a draft of the Allocation to the Buyer no later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing
within ten (10) days of receiving the draft Allocation that Buyer disagrees
with respect to such Allocation, with specificity, in which case the parties
shall resolve such dispute in accordance with _Section 6.4_. In the event
that Buyer does not notify Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence,
Buyer will be deemed to accept such Allocation. The Allocation will be amended
to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price, as applicable, in accordance
with the 

 



69  procedures set forth in this _Section 6.11_. Each of the parties and their
respective Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including, but
not limited to, IRS Form 8594), in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with the allocation pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ (including any
adjustments thereto subsequently made by Buyer and Seller pursuant to this
_Section 6.11_).

 

6.12 _Inconsistencies with the Rest of this Agreement_. If there is any
inconsistency between a provision of this _Article VI_ and a provision of
the remainder of this Agreement with respect to Tax matters, the provisions
of this _Article VI_ shall prevail.

of Buyer contained in this Agreement (other than Buyer Fundamental
Representations and Warranties) shall be true, correct and complete as of the
Closing

"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true and correct in all
respects without regard to such qualifications) with the same effect as
though then made (other than matters that speak as of a particular date, which
shall be true and correct as of such date), other than where failures to be so
true, correct and complete, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) the Buyer Fundamental Representations and Warranties shall be true and
correct in all but _de minimis_ respects on and as of the Closing Date though
then made.

(b) _Performance of Agreements_. The Buyer shall have performed, in all
material respects, all obligations, agreements, conditions, covenants and
commitments required to be fulfilled by it pursuant to the terms hereof on or
prior to the Closing Date.

Prohibitive Order or Law prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by, or the performance of, this
Agreement, nor shall there be any Action threatened, pending or commenced for
the purpose of obtaining a Prohibitive Order.

 

(d) _Antitrust Filings_. All required filings under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws shall have been completed and all applicable time
limitations thereunder shall have expired without a request for further
information by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, or any other relevant
Governmental Authority, or in the event of a request for further information,
the expiration of all applicable time limitations under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws following the delivery of a complete response to
such request shall have occurred without the objection of the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Authority having authority
thereunder.

(e) _Lender Consent_. Seller shall have received all required Consents
permitting the Transfer and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Transitional Services Agreement from the required lenders under the
Seller Senior Credit Facility.

 

(f) _Compliance Certificate_. Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a
certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, dated
as of the Closing Date (executed on behalf of the Company and Seller),
certifying as to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2(a)-(b)_.

notice of an inaccuracy or breach is given prior to expiration thereof to (x)
Seller, in the case of a representation or warranty made by Seller or the
Company or (y) Buyer, in the case of a representation or warranty made by
Buyer. All covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement

specified therein.

before the Closing Date; (F) any Taxes imposed on Seller or its Affiliates,
including the Company or any Continuing Subsidiary, as a result of the

clauses (A) through (G), the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled

finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_.

 

(b) _Indemnification for the Benefit of Seller_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and each
of their respective directors, equity holders, partners, managers, members,
officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, agents, representatives,
controlling Persons, successors and assigns (collectively, "Seller Indemnified
Persons"), from, against any and all Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by

Cap.

 

(b) Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Persons for any Losses
with respect to the Seller Extended Representations and Warranties (other
than the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.13(d)_)
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(ii)_ for Losses in excess of the Cap. The
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.13(d)_ shall not be
subject to the Cap or the Deductible.

(c) Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified Persons for any

(d) The aggregate Liability of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, for any Losses with respect to matters set forth in this _Article
VIII_ other than pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(iv)_ and _Section 8.2(b)(iv)_
shall not exceed the sum of (i) the Base Purchase Price _plus_  (ii) the
amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Working Capital (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.5_) exceeds the Working Capital Target,
_minus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds
the Closing Date Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.5_).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) Neither a Buyer Indemnified Person, nor the Buyer Indemnified Persons as a
group or class, shall be entitled to duplication of recovery from Seller
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ under more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in respect

 



76  of the same Losses suffered. Neither a Seller Indemnified Person, nor the
Seller Indemnified Persons as a group or class, shall be entitled to
duplication of recovery from Buyer pursuant to this  _Article VIII_ under
more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of
the same Losses suffered.

(ii) No Indemnitor shall be liable under this _Article VIII_ for any punitive
damages, except to the extent awarded to a Person other than the Indemnified
Person pursuant to a Third-Party Claim.

 

8.4 _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) Promptly after any Indemnified Person receives notice of the assertion or
commencement, or reasonable expectation of an assertion or commencement, of
any Third-Party Claim against such Indemnified Person with respect to which
any Person obligated to provide indemnity under this _Article VIII_ (Buyer on
the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, each, an "Indemnitor") may have
Liability to any Indemnified Person hereunder, such Indemnified Person shall
promptly and, in no event more than ten (10) days following such Indemnified
Persons receipt of a Third-Party Claim, provide written notice to the
Indemnitor of such Third-Party Claim, stating the nature, basis, the amount or
the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then
reasonably ascertainable, any other remedy sought thereunder and any relevant
time constraints relating thereto, to the extent known, along with copies of
the relevant documents evidencing such Third-Party Claim (a "Claim Notice");
_provided_ that any delay or failure to timely give a Claim Notice or
otherwise comply with the foregoing shall only affect the rights of an
Indemnified Person hereunder to the extent, if at all, such delay or failure
has a materially prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available
to the Indemnitor with respect to such Third-Party Claim or the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such delay
or failure. The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of a Claim
Notice (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be
required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) to notify the
Indemnified Person that it desires to defend the Indemnified Person against
such Third-Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Person shall deliver to
the Indemnitor, promptly following the Indemnified Persons receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Person relating to the Third-Party Claim. 

(b) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified Person within
the period set forth in  _Section 8.4(a)_ that it elects to defend the
Indemnified Person against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the
right to defend the Indemnified Person by appropriate proceedings and shall
have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel of its
choosing, at its expense (which choice of counsel shall be subject to Buyers
prior written Consent (in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Person) or Sellers
prior written Consent (in the case of a Seller Indemnified Person), in each
case, such Consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ that the Indemnitor must conduct the defense of the Third-Party
Claim actively and diligently in order to preserve its rights in this regard
and notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to
elect to defend the Indemnified Person against a

 



77  Third-Party Claim (and the Indemnified Person shall have the sole power to
direct and control such defense) if the Third-Party Claim seeks non-monetary
relief against an Indemnified Person, relates to a criminal action against an
Indemnified Person or involves claims by a Governmental Authority against an
Indemnified Person. Once the Indemnitor has made such election, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in any such defense
and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at such Indemnified Persons
expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel at
the reasonable expense of the Indemnitor if (A) the Indemnitor agrees in
writing to pay such expenses or (B) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to
the Indemnified Person, a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnitor
and the Indemnified Person such that the Indemnitors control of such Third-
Party Claim would be reasonably likely to prejudice the rights of the
Indemnified Person. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written Consent of the
Indemnified Person (which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim if the terms of such settlement does not contain a release
of the Indemnified Person or (1) would result in the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct
of the Indemnified Person, (2) would result in a finding or admission of
wrongdoing or violation of Law by the Indemnified Person, (3) would result in
any monetary Liability of the Indemnified Person that will not be paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnitor or (4) would materially adversely affect any
ongoing business of the Indemnified Person, which, in the case of a Buyer
Indemnified Person, shall include the Business.

 

(c) In the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Person
that it desires to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third-Party
Claim within the period specified in _Section 8.4(a)_, above, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right to defend his/her/itself by appropriate
proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense,
with counsel of its choosing, at Indemnitors expense, _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in any such defense and
to employ separate counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnified Person
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not,
without the prior written Consent of the Indemnitor (which Consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or compromise or
make a written offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim.

(d) The Indemnified Person and the Indemnitor shall reasonably cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim,
including by providing reasonable access to each others relevant books and
records, and employees. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to the Indemnitor of books
and records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees and representatives reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Person and the Indemnitor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (including, as
applicable, the Confidential Information, and in all cases, consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 



78 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.4_ to the contrary, if the
Third-Party Claim relates to Taxes or Tax Liability, the parties shall address
the defense and other actions with respect to such Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the provisions of _Article VI_ hereof.

 

8.5 _Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures_. Each Indemnified Person shall
assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result from a Third-
Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by giving the Indemnitor written notice thereof
reasonably promptly. Such notice by the Indemnified Person shall describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail and indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Person; _provided_ that the failure to timely give such notice or
comply with the foregoing shall only affect the rights of an Indemnified
Person hereunder to the extent such failure has a materially prejudicial
effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnitor with
respect to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnified
Person that it does not dispute the claim described in such notice, or fails
to notify the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) days after delivery of
such notice by the Indemnified Person that the Indemnitor disputes the claim
described in such notice, the Losses in the amount specified in the
Indemnified Persons notice will be conclusively deemed a Liability of the
Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover the amount
of such Losses from the Indemnitor in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this _Article VIII_. If the Indemnitor has timely disputed
its Liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnitor and Indemnified
Person will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute
and if no such resolution is reached, to litigate such dispute.

8.6 _Claims Unaffected by Investigation_. The right of a Buyer Indemnified
Person or a Seller Indemnified Person to indemnification or to assert or
recover on any claim shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy of, or compliance with, any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of, or compliance with, any
covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or other
remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. 

8.7 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that any payment under this Agreement (or deemed to be made, in accordance
with this Agreement) by an Indemnitor to an Indemnified Person shall be
treated, to the fullest extent possible under applicable Law, as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax
purposes and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly, unless
a final determination (within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code) causes
any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment.

 



79 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of (a) fraud or the willful breach
of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement by Buyer, Seller
or the Company, (b) the equitable and other remedies available to the parties,
including those contained in _Section 5.11_, and (c) the remedies contained
in the adjustment provisions of _Section 2.5_, from and after the Closing,
the rights and remedies of any Indemnified Person under this _Article VIII_
are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which
Buyer, Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates, and any
Indemnified Person may have against each other with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby for monetary relief, and each of
Buyer, Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates expressly waive
and release and agree to waive and release any and all other rights or causes
of action for monetary relief they or their Affiliates may have against the
other party or its Affiliates now or in the future under any Law with
respect to the preceding matters.

8.9 _Losses Net of Insurance and Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Losses for
breaches of representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
be determined net of any (a) amount recovered and actually received by the
Indemnified Person under insurance policies with respect to such Losses, net
of the amount of commercially reasonable expenses incurred in procuring such
recovery, if any and (b) Tax benefits actually realized by an Indemnified
Person with respect to such Losses.

8.10 _Mitigation of Losses_. The parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate Losses for which indemnification may be claimed pursuant
to this Agreement to the extent required under applicable Law upon and after
becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such Losses.

ARTICLE IX

Membership Interests contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

sale of the Membership Interests contemplated hereby shall not have been
consummated on or before the date which is six (6) months after the date
hereof (the "Optional Termination Date"), unless extended by written agreement
of Seller and Buyer; _provided_ that if prior to the Optional Termination

being satisfied by the Optional Termination Date, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer the Optional Termination Date shall
automatically be extended until such date that is no later than nine (9)
months from the date of this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement and abandon the sale of the Membership Interests

to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; 

 



80 (c) by either Seller or Buyer, by written notice to the other party, if
any Prohibitive Order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been a material cause
of, or resulted in, the occurrence of such Prohibitive Order, or who has
initiated or taken any action in support of such Prohibitive Order;

(d) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if Seller or the Company has
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement shall be or shall have become inaccurate,
in either case (i) such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
would, individually or in the aggregate, fail to be satisfied on any date
prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that, for purposes of this
_Section 9.1(d)_, such date prior to the Closing Date shall be substituted
for the Closing Date in determining whether the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ have been satisfied), and (ii) such breach or failure to
perform or inaccuracy cannot be cured by Seller or the Company or, if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after
receipt by Seller of notice in writing from Buyer, specifying the nature of
such breach; _provided_ that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if it is then in breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations set
forth in this Agreement that would result in the closing conditions set forth
in _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing) not being satisfied; or

 

(e) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if Buyer has breached or failed to
perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement
or if any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall be or shall have become inaccurate, in either case (i) such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ would, individually or in the
aggregate, fail to be satisfied on any date prior to the Closing Date (it
being understood that, for purposes of this _Section 9.1(e)_, such date prior
to the Closing Date shall be substituted for the Closing Date in
determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been
satisfied), and (ii) such breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy cannot be
cured by Buyer or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of notice in writing from Seller,
specifying the nature of such breach; _provided_ that Seller shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ if
either of Seller or the Company is then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations set forth in
this Agreement that would result in the closing conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing) not being satisfied.

_Section 9.1_ hereof (a) all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder

other party, except for the obligations of the parties pursuant to _Section

the Company, on the other hand, may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ to be satisfied if such failure was

or obligations set forth in this Agreement.

instrument.

assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

 



83 10.7 _Amendments, Modifications and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended at
any time only by execution of an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto. The failure of any of the parties to this Agreement to require the
performance of a term or obligation under this Agreement or the waiver by any
of the parties to this Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not prevent
subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach hereunder.

10.9 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any
jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

 



84 (b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and the
Delaware Supreme Court (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over any matter, any state court within the State of
Delaware) (the "Applicable Courts") with respect to any Action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees
that it will not, directly or indirectly, attempt to defeat or deny such
personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or otherwise, (iii) agrees that it
will not, and it will cause its Affiliates, as applicable, not to, bring or
support any such Action in any court other than the Applicable Courts, (iv)
irrevocably agrees that any such Action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) shall be heard and determined exclusively in
the Applicable Courts, (v) agrees to service of process in any such action in
the manner set forth in _Section 10.2_ and in any other manner prescribed by
the Laws of the State of Delaware.

asset, service, property, goodwill, Intellectual Property, datum or right is
or should be a Business Asset, a Transferred Asset or otherwise an asset of
the Seller Parties (other than the Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries)
and such dispute is submitted for resolution to an Applicable Court, the
parties shall mutually request that the Applicable Court consider the totality
of relevant circumstances in resolving such dispute, including, without
limitation, the extent to which any such asset, service, property, goodwill,
Intellectual Property, datum or right was used in or by, attributable to,
conducted by, created by or as a result of, or otherwise was more directly
connected to, the contracts, financial statements and reports, facility
locations, employees and officers, the aggregate activities conducted by such
employees and officers with respect to, and other relevant attributes of, as
applicable, the activities of Condition Management, Case Management,
Wellbeing, Wellness, Womens and Childrens, and the activities described in
clause (f) of the definition of "Business", each of them considered as a
whole, on the one hand, and the activities of Alere Connect, Alere Analytics,
Standing Stone, Ionian Technologies, Alere Informatics, Alere Home
Monitoring, and the other businesses of the Seller Parties (other than the
Company and the Continuing Subsidiaries), each of them considered as a whole,
on the other hand, but in all cases notwithstanding which legal entity had
title to (or, to the extent the concept of title is not applicable, the right
and interest in) such asset, service, property, goodwill, Intellectual
Property, datum or right.

 

10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



85 10.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
parties agrees that the other parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof and thereof in any proceeding instituted in any of the
Applicable Courts without posting bond or other undertakings in addition to
any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party
further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in
respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate. The remedy in this _Section 10.11_ is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights or remedies a party may
have.

 

10.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the
other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If
any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof), or the application
of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to any Person or entity or any
circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (a) the parties
hereto shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of
this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and enforceable provision giving
effect to the original intent of the parties hereto and (b) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons,
entities or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such
provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
