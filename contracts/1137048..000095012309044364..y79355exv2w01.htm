<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<I>Agreement</I>&#148;), dated as of September&nbsp;18, 2009, is
entered into by and among Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a corporation incorporated under the
laws of Canada (&#147;<I>Parent</I>&#148;), Fairfax Investments USA Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<I>Merger Sub</I>&#148;), and Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent and its affiliates beneficially and of record own 42,399,400 shares of the
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the &#147;<I>Common Stock</I>&#148;), which represents
approximately 72.6% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent has proposed to the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;<I>Company Board</I>&#148;)
that Parent or one of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries (as defined herein) acquire
all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock not owned by Fairfax and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company (the &#147;<I>Company Subsidiaries</I>&#148;)). Parent
and the Subsidiaries of Parent other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are collectively
referred to as the &#147;<I>Fairfax Group</I>&#148;; and such outstanding shares of Common Stock not owned by the
Fairfax Group are collectively referred to as the &#147;<I>Shares</I>&#148;;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company Board has established a special committee consisting of independent

Fairfax Group to acquire Shares, including the Offer (as defined herein), the Merger (as defined
herein) and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
&#147;<I>Transactions</I>&#148;) and to make a recommendation to the Company Board with respect thereto;

to time in accordance with this Agreement, the &#147;<I>Offer</I>&#148;) to acquire up to 100% of the Shares for an
amount equal to $65.00 per Share, net to the stockholders who tender their Shares, in cash and
subject to any required withholding of taxes;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company with the Company surviving as a Subsidiary of Parent (the &#147;<I>Merger</I>&#148;), and, subject to
certain limitations as set forth herein, each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to
the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount
equal to the Offer Price (as defined herein), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Special Committee has unanimously (i)&nbsp;determined that the terms of this Agreement
and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the holders of the
Shares, (ii)&nbsp;approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, and (iii)
recommended to the Company Board that the Company Board adopt resolutions approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions and recommending that the holders of Shares accept

consummation of the Offer (for the avoidance of doubt, provided that the Minimum Condition has been
satisfied and not waived by the Company) and prior to the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;the Effective
Time and (ii)&nbsp;the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. In the event that
Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top Up Option, it shall notify the Company in writing, and shall
set forth in such notice: (A)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common Stock that will be owned by the
Fairfax Group immediately preceding the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, and (B)&nbsp;the place and
time for the closing of the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares by Merger Sub, which shall not be

shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Merger Sub of the number of
shares of Common Stock then outstanding, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis and the proposed number of Top Up Option Shares. At the Top Up Closing, Parent
or Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price for the Top Up Option Shares

purchase price for the Top Up Option Shares. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the
applicable federal rate as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shall mature on the
first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be
prepaid without premium or penalty. In the event that this Agreement is terminated after the Top
Up Option is exercised and prior to the Effective Time, all amounts then owing pursuant to the

acknowledge that the shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<I>Securities Act</I>&#148;),
and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public
offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub will be upon
the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares an &#147;accredited investor&#148;, as defined in Rule&nbsp;501 of
Regulation&nbsp;D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top Up Option and the Top Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with,
any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

undistributed to the holders of shares of Common Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;III shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent
shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this Article&nbsp;III.

delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America (the &#147;<I>United States</I>&#148;) or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained
herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Lost Certificates.</U> If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
them with respect to such Certificate. The Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.
