AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, dated as of January 5, 2001, by and
among Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation ("Parent"), RCC
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Reliance Computer Corp., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), and, with respect to Article 7, Article 9 and Article 10
only, Anantakotiraju Vegesna as Stockholder Agent, and U.S. Stock
Transfer Corporation, as Depositary Agent. Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article 10.  
RECITALS   A. The boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company believe it is in the best interests of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company (as applicable) and their respective shareholders or stockholders (as
applicable) that Parent acquire the Company through the merger of the Merger
Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, in furtherance thereof,
have approved the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) all of the shares of capital
stock of the Company which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive shares of
Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock"), and (ii) all Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock
Purchase Rights then outstanding (whether vested or unvested) will become
exercisable for Parent Common Stock, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.   C. As a condition and an inducement to the
willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of the Company have concurrently herewith entered into (i)
Support Agreements with Parent in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A ("Support Agreements") pursuant to which, among other things, such
stockholders have agreed to vote the shares of Company Common Stock owned by
them in favor of adoption of this Agreement; (ii) Company Affiliate
Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Company
Affiliate Agreements"); and (iii) Stock Repurchase Agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C ("Stock Repurchase
Agreements").   D. As a condition and a further inducement to Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain employees of the Company
have entered into Non-Competition Agreements substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Non-Competition Agreements"), each of
which shall become effective at the Effective Time.   E. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company intend that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and in
furtherance thereof intend that this Agreement shall be a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354(a) and 361(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code.    9   F. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in connection with the Merger.   G. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each
intend that, except to the extent the conditions set forth in Article 6 are
not satisfied, events arising after the date of this Agreement shall not
serve to relieve any party from its obligations to consummate the Merger and
that, except as provided in Section 8.2, the parties shall have no liability
upon termination of this Agreement as permitted by Section 8.1.   H. A
portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable or reserved
for issuance by Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed
in escrow by Parent, the release of which amount shall be contingent upon
certain events and conditions, all as set forth in Article 7.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, representations and warranties
set forth herein, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:    ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective
Time and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the California Code and Delaware Law, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation. The Company is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving
Corporation."   1.2 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing"), which is expected to take place on or about January 16, 2001,
will take place no later than five Business Days following satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, at the offices of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison LLP, 550 South Hope Street, Los Angeles, California,
unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the Company. The date
upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger (or like instrument), in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Certificate of
Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of applicable law (the time of acceptance by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of such filing or such later time
as may be agreed to by the parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger
being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").   1.3 Effect of the
Merger on Constituent Corporations. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.    
-2-  10   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving
Corporation.   (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation
of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be amended and restated in its entirety in the form set forth as Annex 1 to
Exhibit E attached hereto, and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time until thereafter amended as provided by law, such certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) The bylaws
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
by such bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and applicable law.   1.5
Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time and Anantakotiraju Vegesna shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, except
that Anantakotiraju Vegesna shall hold the office of President and Chief
Executive Officer and Ken McMaster shall hold the office of Vice President,
Operations, each to hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.6 Maximum Number of Shares of Parent Common Stock
to be Issued; Effect on Outstanding Securities of the Company. Subject to
Section 5.23, the maximum number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued (including Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon
exercise of any Company Options or Company Warrants to be assumed by Parent
as provided herein) in exchange for the acquisition by Parent of all shares
of Company Common Stock (including any restricted stock issued to employees
and others) which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and all vested and unvested Company Options and Company
Warrants which are then outstanding (other than Company Warrants which by
their terms expire without payment, conversion, adjustment or other
consideration at the Effective Time) shall not exceed the Aggregate Share
Number. No adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger as a result of any consideration (in any form
whatsoever) received by the Company from the date hereof to the Effective
Time as a result of any exercise, conversion or exchange of Company Options
or Company Warrants. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of
any shares of the Company Common Stock or Company Options or Company
Warrants, the following shall occur:   (a) Conversion of Company Common
Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to
be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as
provided in Section 1.9)) shall be cancelled, extinguished and converted
automatically into the right to receive, following the expiration or early
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act which is applicable to
the holder of such share, (i) at the Effective Time, that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the Closing Exchange Ratio, and (ii) on each
Earn Out     -3-  11  Delivery Date, that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (if any) equal to the applicable Earn Out Exchange Ratio
(subject to Section 1.13); provided that shares of Company Common Stock
issued upon exercise of the Lenders Warrant shall not be entitled to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock under this clause (ii).   (b) Cancellation of
Parent-Owned and Company-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and
extinguished without any (i) conversion thereof or (ii) further action on the
part of Parent or the Company.   (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share
of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, each share certificate of
Merger Sub theretofore evidencing ownership of any such shares shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
(d) Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Plans. All unexpired
and unexercised Company Options and Company Warrants, then outstanding,
whether vested or unvested, together with the Company Stock Plans, shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section
1.6(d).   (i) Each unexpired and unexercised Company Option and
Company Warrant then outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall be, in
connection with the Merger, assumed by Parent, together with the Company
Stock Plans. Each Company Option and Company Warrant so assumed by Parent
under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option or Company
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase
rights or vesting provisions), provided that such Company Option or Company
Warrant, as the case may be, shall be exercisable for (A) that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option or Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "Exercise Number") multiplied by (y) the Closing Exchange Ratio, plus
(B) that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
Exercise Number multiplied by the sum of all Earn Out Exchange Ratios with
respect to Earn Out Delivery Dates occurring prior to the date of exercise of
such Company Option or Company Warrant (with the sum of the amounts set forth
in (A) and (B) being rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, and the fractional share of Parent Common Stock so
deleted, if any, being paid instead in cash pursuant to Section 1.8),
plus (C) the right to receive on each Earn Out Delivery Date, if any,
occurring after the date of exercise of such Company Option or Company
Warrant, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
the Exercise Number multiplied by the sum of the Earn Out Exchange Ratios
with respect to all such after occurring Earn Out Delivery Dates (rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with the
fractional share of Parent Common Stock so deleted, if any, being paid
instead in cash pursuant to Section 1.8); provided, that the Lenders\'
Warrant shall not, in accordance with its terms, be entitled to any shares of
Parent Common Stock on any Earn Out     -4-  12  Delivery Date. In the
case of a partial exercise of a Company Option or Company Warrant, the above
amounts shall be adjusted proportionally. It is the intention of the parties
that the Company Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following the
Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code to the same extent the Company Options qualified as
incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
provisions of this Section 1.6(d) shall be applied consistent with
this intent.   (ii) Parent shall assume the Company\'s obligations, and
shall be assigned the Company\'s repurchase rights and purchase options,
under any stock option agreements, buy-back agreements, and supplemental
agreements entered into pursuant to the RTAC Corp. Stock Option Plan 1.0, as
amended, Reliance Computer Corp. Stock Option Plan 1.1, as amended and
Reliance Computer Corp. 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the
"Company Stock Plans") and the other agreements listed on Schedule 1.6(d)(ii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, true and correct copies of which have
been made available by the Company to Parent. Except as provided in Section
1.6(d)(iii), any and all restrictions on the Company Options granted under
the Company Stock Plans and related agreements, and the Company Common Stock
issued pursuant thereto or pursuant to any such other agreements which do not
lapse in accordance with their terms (as in effect at the Effective Time)
shall continue in full force and effect until such restrictions lapse
pursuant to the terms of such Company Stock Plans and agreements, and any
repurchase rights or repurchase options which the Company has with respect to
such Company Options and Company Common Stock shall also continue in full
force and effect.   (iii) Each of the Company and Parent agrees to take all
actions necessary or advisable to cause all Company Options and Company
Warrants to remain unchanged except for the conversion into options, warrants
or rights to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock as provided for in this
Section 1.6(d).   (e) Reservation of Shares. Parent will reserve sufficient
shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance pursuant to Section 1.6(d).  
1.7 Adjustments to Exchange Ratios and Rights to Receive Parent Common Stock.
The Exchange Ratios, and any rights of the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Warrants, and/or Company Options to receive Parent Common Stock at
any time hereunder, and other relevant amounts hereunder shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse
split, stock combination, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock the
effective date of which occurs after the date hereof.   1.8 Fractional
Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
who would otherwise be entitled, whether as of the Closing or any Earn Out
Delivery Date, to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by
such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (a) such
fraction, multiplied by (b) the Closing Price.     -5-  13   1.9
Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary (other than Section 1.9(b)), any shares of Company Common Stock
held by a holder who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such
shares in accordance with Delaware Law and the California Code, as
applicable, and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn
or lost such appraisal or dissenters\' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not
be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to
such rights as are granted by the Delaware Law and the California Code, as
applicable.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.9(a), if any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of such shares
under Delaware Law or the California Code shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of
the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event,
such holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent
only the right to receive Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 1.6,
without interest thereon, upon surrender to the Company of the certificate
representing such shares in accordance with Section 1.10.   (c) The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of its receipt of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments relating to the Merger served pursuant to Delaware
Law or the California Code and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law or the California Code, as
applicable. Any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company
Common Stock or offer to settle any such demands shall be made by the Company
from its own funds and shall not be funded directly or indirectly by Parent,
provided, that the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent or as may be required under applicable law, voluntarily make any
such payment or offer to settle.   1.10 Exchange Procedures.   (a) Parent
Common Stock. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable at the time of Closing (including
shares to be deposited into the Escrow Fund under Article 7) in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. On each Earn Out Delivery Date,
Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for distribution in accordance
with Section 1.6 and Section 1.13, the aggregate number of shares, if any, of
Parent Common Stock (including shares, if any, to be deposited into
the Escrow Fund under Article 7) then issuable pursuant to Sections 1.6 and
1.13, together, in each case, with cash in an amount sufficient to permit the
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8. The
Exchange Agent shall deposit the appropriate portion of each such deposit by
Parent into the Escrow Fund in accordance with the subsections of this
Section 1.10(a) and Article 7.     -6-  14   (i) The deposits into the
Escrow Fund on behalf of each holder of Company Common Stock shall be (x), on
the Closing Date, the number of shares of Company Common Stock actually owned
by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the
Closing Exchange Ratio multiplied by one-tenth (0.10); and (y), on each Earn
Out Delivery Date, the lesser of (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock actually owned by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the applicable Earn Out Exchange Ratio, multiplied by one-tenth
(0.10) and (B) such holder\'s Fully Diluted Stock Share of the difference
between (I) the sum of all Reasonable Amounts as of such Earn Out Delivery
Date and (II) the Escrow Amount, immediately prior to such Earn Out Delivery
Date, determined under Article 7.   (ii) The deposits into the Escrow Fund
on behalf of each holder of a Company Option or Company Warrant (but not the
Lender Warrants) shall be (x), on the Closing Date, zero (0); (y), on an
Option Exercise Date, (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that
would have been deposited in the Escrow Fund on Closing Date pursuant to
Section 1.10(a)(i)(x) had such Company Option or Company Warrant (other than
the Lenders Warrants) been exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would have been
deposited in the Escrow Fund on each Earn Out Delivery Date occurring prior
to such Option Exercise Date pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(i)(y) had such
Company Option or Company Warrant (other than the Lenders\' Warrants) been
exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (z), on each Earn Out
Delivery Date occurring after an Option Exercise Date, the number of shares
that would have deposited in the Escrow Fund on such Earn Out Delivery Date
pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(i)(y) (replacing the Fully Diluted Stock Share
with Fully Dilutes Option Share for purposes of this calculation) had such
Company Option or Company Warrant (other than the Lenders\' Warrants) been
exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time. Additionally, there shall
be deposited into the Unexercised Escrow on behalf of each holder of
a Company Option or Company Warrant (but not the Lender Warrants) (x) on
the Closing Date, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock specified in
clause (y)(A) above; and (y) on each Earn Out Delivery Date occurring prior
to the Option Exercise Date, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that
would have been deposited in the Escrow Fund on such Earn Out Delivery Date

so credited under Section 1.10(a)(i) and Section 1.10(a)(ii) shall be
delivered to the Exchange Agent immediately upon release from the Escrow Fund
for delivery to such holder.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") and which
shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and     -7-  15  (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed
by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock,
less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in the
Escrow Fund on such holder\'s behalf pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(i), to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (without giving effect to any
of the Earn Outs) plus the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. From and after each of the Earn Out Delivery
Dates, the Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was the holder
of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares issued or
issuable upon exercise of any Lenders\' Warrant) shall be entitled to receive
a certificate representing the number of additional whole shares of Parent
Common Stock (if any) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.6 and Section 1.13, plus the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time and subject to and in accordance with the provisions
of Article 7, the Exchange Agent shall cause to be distributed to the
Depositary Agent a certificate or certificates (in such denominations as may
be requested by the Depositary Agent) representing that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of all amounts under Section
1.10(a)(i)(x) which certificate shall be registered in the name of
the Depositary Agent. As soon as practicable after any Earn Out Delivery
Date, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article 7, (A)
the Exchange Agent shall cause to be distributed to the Depositary Agent a
certificate or certificates (in such denominations as may be requested by the
Depositary Agent) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the sum of all amounts under Section 1.10(a)(i)(y) and (B) Parent
shall cause to be distributed to the Depositary Agent a certificate or
certificates (in such denominations as may be requested by the Depositary
Agent) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
sum of all amounts under Section 1.10(a)(ii)(z). As soon as practicable after
any Option Exercise Date, and subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of Article 7, Parent shall cause to be distributed to the
Depositary Agent a certificate or certificates (in such denominations as may
be requested by the Depositary Agent) representing the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of all amounts under Section
1.10(a)(ii)(y). Such shares shall be beneficially owned by the holders on
whose behalf such shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be
available, together and pro rata with the shares deemed to be in
the Unexercised Escrow, to compensate Parent as provided in Article 7.
Until surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective
Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment
of taxable dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares
of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been so converted (subject only to, if applicable, the expiration or
early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act which is applicable
to the holder of such shares), and, except in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Lenders\' Warrant, the right to
receive Earn Out Shares (if any) and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Each
of Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Agent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the procedures and
requirements imposed upon    -8-  16  the above matters by that certain
Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of August 24, 2000, by Anantakotiraju
Vegesna, Sai Gadiraju, Sujith Arramreddy, in favor of Bank of America, N.A.
and related documents.   (c) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged
Shares of Company Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made after the Effective Time and
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section
1.10(c)) with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d)
Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock
is to be issued pursuant to the Merger in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   1.11 No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon
the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Company of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 1.   1.12 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
In the event any certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof; provided, however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to provide an indemnity
or deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.     -9-  17   1.13 Earn Out Shares.   (a) Earn Out Shares;
Earn Out Milestones. Schedule 1.13 sets forth three (3) additional
distributions (of Earn Out Shares) in the form of shares of Parent Common
Stock which may be issued or issuable as additional consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6(a)(ii), 1.6(d)(i)(B) and 1.6(d)(i)(C), and the applicable
Milestones that must be satisfied in order for the Parent to become obligated
to issue any Earn Out Shares. Except as set forth in Schedule 1.13, no Earn
Out Shares are subject to increase to make up for any reduction or forfeiture
of any other Earn Out Shares. Earn Out Shares that are distributable shall be
distributed in accordance with Sections 1.6(d) and 1.10(b) or to the extent
appropriate (in the case of unexercised Company Options and Company Warrants)
reserved for issuance in accordance with Sections 1.6(d) and 1.7 to the
Persons who immediately prior to the Effective Time were holders of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock issued
upon exercise of the Lenders\' Warrant), Company Options or Company Warrants
(other than the Lenders\' Warrant). For purposes of this Section 1.13,
holders of Parent Common Stock received upon the exercise, after the
Effective Time and prior to the satisfaction of the applicable Milestone, of
Company Options or Company Warrants (other than any Lenders\' Warrant)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
holders of Certificates under Section 1.10(b). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no Earn Out Shares shall be allocable to the
Lenders\' Warrant or shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of
the Lenders\' Warrant.   (b) Illustrative Examples. The provisions of this
Agreement relating to the Earn Out Shares shall be interpreted and applied in
a manner consistent with the examples set forth in Schedule 1.13. Those
examples are illustrative only and no representation or warranty is made with
respect to the amounts set forth therein.   (c) Procedure.   (i) No later
than each Earn Out Delivery Date, Parent shall provide to the Stockholder
Agent either (A) a statement that the relevant Milestones for distribution of
Earn Out Shares set forth in Schedule 1.13 have been satisfied in whole or in
part) and, if relevant to such determination, appropriate supporting
documentation regarding such Milestones and criteria or (B) a statement that
the relevant Milestones set forth in Schedule 1.13 have not been satisfied
and, if relevant to such determination, appropriate supporting documentation
regarding such Milestones (each, in case of either clause (A) or (B), an
"Earn Out Determination"). If the Earn Out Determination indicates that the
applicable Milestones have been satisfied in full and that the
applicable maximum number of Earn Out Shares are distributable with respect
to such Milestones or, in the case of Company Options or Company Warrants
(other than the Lenders\' Warrant), will be reserved for issuance, then no
action on the part of the Stockholder Agent shall be necessary and such Earn
Out Determination shall be deemed final (a "Final Earn Out Amount"). In any
other case, the Stockholder Agent will notify Parent in writing within
fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of such Earn Out Determination whether
the Stockholder Agent disputes any such determination, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the dispute (each an "Earn Out Dispute
Notice"). If the Stockholder Agent does not deliver an Earn Out Dispute
Notice within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of an Earn Out
Determination or if the Stockholder Agent accepts such amount in writing,
such Earn Out Determination shall be deemed a Final Earn Out Amount. In the
event an Earn Out Dispute Notice is delivered, Parent and the Stockholder
Agent shall meet within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of such
Earn     -10-  18  Out Dispute Notice to attempt to resolve such
dispute in good faith. If a final resolution of such dispute is reached, the
agreed upon amount shall be deemed to be the Final Earn Out Amount. If no
final resolution is determined within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
delivery of such Earn Out Dispute Notice after good faith negotiation, the
final determination of a Final Earn Out Amount shall be submitted by the
Parent and the Company Stockholders first, to non-binding mediation in
accordance with the Commercial Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration
Association and utilizing a mediator acceptable to both parties, and, if no
final resolution of such dispute is reached within thirty (30) days of
appointment of the mediator, or if the parties cannot agree on a
mediator within thirty (30) days, then to arbitration in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 7.2(g)(ii) and Section 7.2(g)(iii). The
determination of the arbitrators shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, be final, binding and conclusive upon each Company Stockholder, each
holder of Company Options or Company Warrants, the Stockholder Agent and
Parent.   (ii) The Stockholder Agent may notify Parent in writing at
any time that he believes an applicable Milestone has been satisfied. Parent
will cooperate in good faith with the Stockholder Agent to determine whether
such Milestone has been satisfied at such time.   (d) Stockholder Agent.
The provisions of Sections 7.2(h), 7.2(i) and 7.2(k) shall apply to any acts
taken by the Stockholder Agent pursuant to this Section 1.13. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Agent in connection with this Section 1.13 shall constitute a
decision of all Company Stockholders shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon each of the Company Stockholders and Parent may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of every such holder. Parent is
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done in accordance
with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent.  
(e) No Assignment of Earn Out Rights. No interest in any Earn Out Shares or
any portion thereof, no right to participate, in whole or in part, in any
distribution of Earn Out Shares pursuant to Section 1.13, and no right
to receive any distribution of cash or securities in connection therewith
pursuant to Section 1.10 may be assigned or transferred to any Person
(whether by operation of law, or in connection with any sale, assignment or
other transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock, Company Warrants or
Company Options (or any Parent securities issued in exchange therefor
pursuant to Section 1.6), or otherwise), and any attempt to do so will be
null and void, provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, such rights may
be assigned (i) by holders of Company Warrants, as permitted under the terms
of such Company Warrants and (ii) by holders of Company Options, as permitted
under the terms of the documents governing such Company Options. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 1.13(e), the Earn Out Shares and the
provisions of Section 1.10 and Section 1.13 relating to such Earn Out Shares
are intended solely for the benefit of the Persons who immediately prior to
the Effective Time were holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Warrants or Company Options. Subject to the proviso at the end of the first
sentence of this Section 1.13(e), the right (if any) to receive distributions
in connection with any Earn Out Shares shall be personal to the Persons who
immediately prior to the Effective Time were holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Warrants or Company Options, and such right shall not (x) attach to
or run with such stock, warrants or options or any Parent securities issued
in exchange therefor or (y) inure to the     -11-  19  benefit of any
purchaser, assignee or other transferee of such stock, warrants or options or
such Parent securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest in Earn
Out Shares may be assigned or transferred involuntarily pursuant to (A) will,
(B) the laws of intestate succession, (C) a qualified domestic
relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, or (D) to the extent
permitted under Revenue Procedure 84-42 (or any successor thereto) a transfer
by an entity to a successor entity.   (f) No Interest. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any Earn Out Shares or any payment or distribution
pursuant to Section 1.13 relating to the Earn Out Shares.   1.14 Exemption
From Registration; California Permit. Parent and the Company intend that the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in
connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder (the "Securities Act"),
by reason of Section 3(a)(10) thereof or, pursuant to Section 5.1(c), by
reason of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.1(c), Parent and the Company intend that the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in connection with the
Merger will be qualified under the California Code, pursuant to Section 25121
thereof, after a fairness hearing has been held pursuant to the authority
granted by Section 25142 of such law (the "Fairness Hearing"), and (if deemed
necessary by Parent in its good faith judgment) such Fairness Hearing may
also address the assumption by Parent of all Company Options, Company
Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights pursuant to Section 1.6. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to file
promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an
application for issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 25121 of the
California Code to issue such securities and (if deemed necessary by Parent
as provided above) to assume such Company Options and Company
Warrants required by this Agreement to be assumed by Parent (the "California
Permit") and (ii) to obtain the California Permit as promptly as practicable
thereafter.   1.15 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company or Merger
Sub, or to perfect the Surviving Corporation\'s ownership of any and all
Company Intellectual Property, or to complete and prosecute all domestic and
foreign patent and trademark filings related to Company Intellectual
Property, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

the amount, of any compensation theretofore or thereafter due or granted to

Proceedings involving the Plans, or the fiduciaries, administrators, or
trustees of any of the Plans or the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates as the employer or sponsor under any Plan, with

and all third parties (other than Governmental or Regulatory Authorities) in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

CONDUCT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME   4.1 Conduct of Business of the
Company. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier of (x) the termination of this Agreement and (y) the
Effective Time, the Company agrees (unless the Company is required to take

business substantially in the usual, regular and ordinary course
substantially consistent with past practice and in any event consistent with
the Operating Plan provided prior to the date of this Agreement to Parent

Liabilities and Taxes consistent with the Company\'s past practices (and
in any event when due), to pay or perform other obligations when due

commercially reasonable efforts and institute all commercially reasonable
policies required to preserve substantially intact its present business
organization, keep available the services of its present officers and key
employees and preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers,
distributors, licensors, licensees, independent contractors and other Persons
having    -46-  54  business dealings with it, all with the express
purpose and intent of preserving substantially unimpaired its goodwill and
ongoing businesses at the Effective Time, provided, however, that the Company
may without necessity of Parent approval make adjustments to its operations

respond to any changed market, competitive, or economic conditions. Subject

without the prior written consent of Parent, take or agree in writing or
otherwise to take, any action that would prevent the Company from performing

knowingly cause any condition to Parent\'s closing obligations in Section 6.1
or Section 6.3 not to be satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the

No Solicitation. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section
8.1, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will take, nor will the
Company permit any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to
take any of the following actions with any Person other than Parent and its
designees: (a) solicit, encourage, initiate, entertain, accept receipt of,
review or encourage any proposals or offers from, or participate in or
conduct discussions with or engage in negotiations with, any Person relating
to any offer or proposal, oral, written or otherwise, formal or informal,
with respect to any possible Business Combination with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiaries are in existence on the date
hereof or are    -49-  57  hereafter organized), (a "Competing Proposed
Transaction"), (b) provide information with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiaries are in existence on the date
hereof or are hereafter organized) to any Person, other than Parent, relating
to (or which the Company believes would be used for the purpose of
formulating an offer or proposal with respect to), or otherwise assist,

Person with regard to, any possible Business Combination with the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on the
date hereof or are hereafter organized), (c) agree to, enter into a Contract
with any Person, other than Parent, providing for, or approve a Business
Combination with the Company or any Subsidiary (whether such Subsidiary is in
existence on the date hereof or are hereafter organized) or (d) authorize or
permit any of the Company\'s Representatives to take any such
action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its board of directors
shall be permitted to engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information or data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written inquiry, proposal or offer of a Competing Proposed Transaction
by any such Person, if and only to the extent that, in any such case, (i) the
board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith that such inquiry,
proposal or offer of a Competing Proposed Transaction constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after considering the written advice of outside counsel admitted to practice
in Delaware) that failing to take such action would be reasonably likely
to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable law, (iii) prior to providing any information or data to any
Person in connection with any such written offer of a Competing Proposed
Transaction by any such Person, the board of directors of the Company
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms at least as stringent as those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreements and (iv) prior to providing any information or data to any Person
or entering into any negotiations with any Person, the Company notifies ( the
"Proposal Notice") Parent promptly, but in any event within 24 hours, of such
inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information or data
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company, its directors, or employees or any
of its agents or representatives indication in connection with such notice,
the names of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers; provided, however, that the Company shall not
provide any information or data to any such Person or enter into discussions
or negotiations with any such Person until two Business Days have expired
following the delivery of the Proposal Notice to Parent. The Company agrees
that it will promptly keep Parent informed of the status and terms of any
such inquiries, proposals or offers and the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status and terms of any such discussions
or negotiations. The Company agrees that it will use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly inform its officers, directors, key employees
and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 4.2.
Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall permit the Company to terminate this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledge that this Section 4.2
was a significant inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement and the absence of such provision would have resulted in either (i)
a material reduction in the consideration to be paid to the stockholders of
the Company in the Merger or (ii) a failure to induce Parent and Merger Sub
to enter into this Agreement.   ARTICLE 5  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   5.1
Information Statement; Permit Application.    -50-  58   (a) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company,
and as applicable, its Subsidiaries shall prepare, with the full cooperation
of Parent, the Information Statement for the stockholders of the Company to
adopt this Agreement. Parent, the Company, and each of Company\'s
Subsidiaries shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Information Statement to comply with applicable federal and state
securities laws requirements. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries\' business and financial statements and affairs as, in the
reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any amendments
or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate
with the other\'s counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Information
Statement. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries will promptly advise
Parent, and Parent will promptly advise the Company in writing if at any time
prior to the Effective Time either the Company, its Subsidiaries or Parent,
as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it
necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Information Statement in
order to make the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein
not misleading or to comply with applicable law. The Information Statement
shall contain the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of the
Company that the Company\'s stockholders adopt this Agreement and the
conclusion of the board of directors that the terms and conditions of the
Merger are advisable and fair and reasonable to, and in the best
interests of, the stockholders of the Company. Anything to the contrary
contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the
Information Statement any information with respect to Parent or its
affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information shall not
have been approved by Parent prior to such inclusion. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may make a Qualifying Amendment if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company\'s board of directors (consistent with the written
advice of outside counsel admitted to practice in Delaware) the failure to
make such Qualifying Amendment is likely to constitute to a breach of the
directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under Delaware
Law.   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, Parent shall prepare, with the cooperation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and file the Permit Application. Parent and the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Permit Application to comply with the requirements of applicable federal and
state laws and to cause the California Permit to be issued. Each of Parent
and the Company agrees to provide promptly to the other such information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries\' business and financial statements and
affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel,
may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Permit Application, or in
any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors
to cooperate with the other\'s counsel and auditors in the preparation and
completion of the Permit Application. The Company and its Subsidiaries will
promptly advise Parent, and Parent will promptly advise the Company, in
writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Parent, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of any facts
that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Permit
Application in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law. Anything
to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Parent shall not include in
the Permit Application any information with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates or associates, the form and
content of which information shall not have been approved by the Company
prior to such inclusion.    -51-  59   (c) In the event that it is
reasonably determined by Parent or the Company, following consultation with
the other party and after Parent or the Company, as applicable, has used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the California Permit, that such
Permit cannot be obtained, or cannot reasonably be expected to be obtained,
in time to permit the Closing to occur on or before January 31, 2001, then
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect
the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 1.6 in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act on terms and conditions that are reasonably satisfactory to both Parent
and Company. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in such event: (i)
as a condition to effecting such issuance as a private placement pursuant
to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, Parent shall be entitled to obtain
from each stockholder of the Company a Stockholder Certificate in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (or such other form as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) (the "Stockholder Certificate") and that Parent will
be relying upon the representations made by each stockholder of the Company
in the applicable Stockholder Certificate in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Stock to such stockholder, provided that Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in arranging for a purchaser representative
for any Company stockholders for whom such a representative may be necessary;
(ii) (A) prior to Closing, Parent shall acting in good faith enter into and
deliver to Company a registration rights agreement reasonably acceptable to
each of Parent and the Company (the "Backup Registration Rights Agreement")
providing that as soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty days
after the Closing, Parent shall, with cooperation in customary form of each
Company stockholder participating in such registration, prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act for such shares on
whatever form shall then be available to register such shares for public sale
on a shelf registration basis, and (B) Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the effectiveness of such registration statement
as quickly as possible and to maintain such effectiveness of at least one-
half of each calendar quarter (or portion thereof) following the Closing
until all such shares may be sold publicly under the Securities Act
(including sales under Rule 144 in brokers\' transactions as therein
defined); (iii) prior to the effectiveness of such registration, the shares
of Parent Common Stock so issued in the private placement pursuant to Section
1.6 will not be registered under the Securities Act and will constitute
"restricted securities" within the meaning of the Securities Act; and (iv)
the certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock shall bear
appropriate legends to identify such privately placed shares as being
restricted under the Securities Act, to comply with applicable state
securities laws and, if applicable, to notice the restrictions on transfer of
such shares.   5.2 Stockholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
give written notice of this Agreement and the proposed Merger to all Company
stockholders and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all other
action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company or to secure the written consent of its stockholders ("Company
Stockholder Action") before January 18, 2001. The Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders for adoption whether or not the Company\'s
board of directors determines at any time subsequent to declaring its
advisability that this Agreement is no longer advisable and recommends that
its stockholders reject it. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding
the date of the Company Stockholder Action and shall not postpone or adjourn
(other than for the absence of a quorum) any meeting of the stockholders of
the Company without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be   
-52-  60  unreasonably withheld. The Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts required to solicit and obtain from stockholders of the
Company proxies or written consents in favor of the Merger and this Agreement
and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
written consent of stockholders required to effect the Merger. The materials
submitted to the stockholders of the Company in respect of the Merger shall
have been subject to prior review and comment by Parent and shall include (a)
information regarding the Company, the terms of the Merger and this
Agreement, (b) subject to the right under Section 5.1(a) to make a Qualifying
Amendment, the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of the
Company that the Company\'s stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve and
execute such other documents as may be required to satisfy the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act in connection with the issuance and sale
of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, (c) subject to the right under Section
5.1(a) to make a Qualifying Amendment, the conclusion of the board of
directors of the Company that the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Merger are advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests
of, the Company\'s stockholders and (d) such other documents as may be
required to satisfy the applicable requirements of the Securities Act in
connection with the issuance and sale of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger.   5.3 Access to Information. Subject in all cases to the
Company\'s obligations of confidentiality with respect to third-party
confidential information, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier
of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall (a) give Parent and its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financing sources and other agents and representatives
full access to all buildings, offices, and other facilities and to all Books
and Records of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether located on the
premises of the Company or at another location; (b) permit Parent to make
such inspections as it may require; (c) cause its officers to furnish Parent
such financial, operating, technical and product data and other information
with respect to the business and Assets and Properties of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as Parent from time to time may request, including financial
statements and schedules; (e) allow Parent the opportunity to interview such
employees and other personnel and Affiliates of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with the Company\'s prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (f) assist and cooperate with
Parent in the development of cooperation plans for implementation by Parent
and the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time; provided,
however, that no investigation made prior to the date of this Agreement or
made pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein. Subject to Section 5.4
and the agreements referenced therein, materials furnished to Parent pursuant
to this Section 5.4 may be used by Parent for strategic and
integration planning purposes relating to accomplishing the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.4 Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that
Parent and the Company have previously executed certain non-disclosure
agreements and an Exclusivity Agreement containing confidentiality provisions
dated as of October 16, 2000, and have implemented certain confidentiality
procedures pursuant thereto (collectively, the "Confidentiality Agreements"),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Without limiting the foregoing, all information
furnished to Parent and its officers, employees, accountants and counsel by
the Company, and all information furnished to the Company by Parent and its
officers, employees, accountants and counsel, shall be covered by the
Confidentiality Agreements, and Parent and the Company shall be fully liable
and responsible    -53-  61  under the Confidentiality Agreements for
any breach of the terms and conditions thereof by their respective
subsidiaries, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
Representatives.   5.5 Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger (whether or not it is consummated), including all
legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and
expenses of third parties ("Third-Party Expenses") incurred by a party or
other Person in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be the obligation of the respective party or other Person incurring
such fees and expenses. The Company shall consult, in advance, with Parent
prior to incurring material Third-Party Expenses in excess of the estimates
previously provided to Parent.   5.6 Public Disclosure. Unless otherwise
required by Law (including federal and state securities laws) or, as to
Parent, by the rules and regulations of the NASD, prior to the Effective
Time, no public disclosure (whether or not in response to any inquiry) of the
existence of any subject matter of, or the terms and conditions of, this
Agreement shall be made by any party hereto unless approved by Parent and the
Company prior to release; provided, however, that such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each of
Parent and the Company shall be permitted to disclose the existence (but not
the terms) of this Agreement to their customers, suppliers and sales
representatives with whom it has non-disclosure agreements that apply to such
disclosure (or the other party otherwise agrees to such disclosure) and,
except as set forth in Section 4.2, for which there is a business reason for
the disclosure and (ii) pursuant to Section 4.2, the Company may, in general
terms only, in response to inquiries from third parties concerning any
Competing Proposed Transaction, inform such third parties that the Company is
under a contractual obligation not to discuss such matters.   5.7
Approvals. The Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all Approvals from Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or under
any of the Contracts or other agreements as may be required in
connection with the Merger (all of which Approvals are set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule) so as to preserve all rights of and benefits to
the Company thereunder and each party shall provide the other with such
assistance and information as is reasonably required to obtain such
Approvals.   5.8 FIRPTA Compliance. On or prior to the Closing Date, the

obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).   5.9
Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date and (b) any failure
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies
available to the party receiving such notice.    -54-  62   5.10
Company Affiliate Agreements. Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth those persons who, in the Company\'s reasonable judgment following
consultation with legal counsel and accounting advisors, are or may be
"affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (the "Company Affiliates"). The Company shall provide
Parent such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for
purposes of reviewing such list. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent on or prior
to the Closing from each of the Company Affiliates, an executed Company
Affiliate Agreement. The Company agrees that if any Person would have been a
Company Affiliate had such Person been an officer, director or stockholder of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such person to execute and deliver
to the Company a Company Affiliate Agreement promptly upon such Person
attaining such status.   5.11 Additional Documents and Further Assurances;
Cooperation. Each party hereto, at the request of the other party hereto,
shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such
other acts and things (including all action reasonably necessary to seek and
obtain any and all consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority or Person required in connection with the Merger;
provided, however, that neither party shall be obligated to consent to any
divestitures or operational limitations or activities in connection therewith
and no party shall be obligated to make a payment of money as a condition to
obtaining any such consent, waiver or approval) as may be necessary or
desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to use best efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Article 6 to be satisfied, where the
satisfaction of such conditions depends on action or forbearance from action
by such party. The Company and Parent shall each use best efforts to deliver
(including taking all actions within their respective control necessary to be
able to deliver) tax matter certificates to counsel substantially in the form
of Exhibit G-1 attached hereto, in the case of the Company, and Exhibit G-2
attached hereto, in the case of Parent.   5.12 Indemnification. Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the employees,
agents, directors or officers of the Company (the "Company Indemnified
Parties") as provided in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of three years from and
after the Closing Date, assuming the consummation of the Merger; provided,
however, that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within
such three-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue to disposition of any and all such claims. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company
Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or indemnification agreements of the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise shall be made by independent counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation reasonably satisfactory to the Company
Indemnified Party (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation), which such determination shall be final and binding on the
parties thereto. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent that no
claim for indemnification has been made by any director or officer of the
Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, no basis exists for any such
claim for indemnification.    -55-  63   5.13 Form S-8. Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options promptly after the
Effective Time to the extent the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Options qualify for registration on Form S-8.  
5.14 NNM Listing of Additional Shares Application. Parent shall, to
the extent required by the rules of the NNM, file a listing of additional
shares with the NNM with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger.   5.15
Company\'s Auditors. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its management and its independent auditors to facilitate on a timely
basis (a) the preparation of financial statements (including pro
forma financial statements if required) as required by Parent to comply
with applicable SEC regulations, (b) the review of any Company audit or
review work papers, including the examination of selected interim financial
statements and data, (c) the delivery of such representations from the
Company\'s independent accountants as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or its accountants, and (d) the securing of a binding fee commitment (on
terms similar to those in place on the date of this Agreement) with respect
to consents and comfort letters requested by Parent after the Closing.  
5.16 Termination of 401(k) Plans. Unless Parent requests otherwise
in writing, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt
resolutions terminating, effective prior to the Closing Date, any Plan which
is intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and which is sponsored, or contributed to, by the Company or
any Subsidiary. At the Closing, the Company shall provide Parent (a) executed
resolutions of the board of directors of Parent authorizing such termination
and (b) as necessary, an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan sufficient to
assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue
Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the
401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of termination.   5.17 Takeover
Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, the board of directors of the Company will
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   5.18 Post-Closing Conduct of
Business.   (a) Neither Parent nor the Company shall take, nor permit
its Affiliates to take, any action prior to or following the Closing that
would cause the Merger, including the delivery of all Parent Common Stock to
the holders of shares of Company Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants
under Section 1.6(a), to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and each shall report
all transactions under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in
accordance with their characterizations herein.    -56-  64   (b)
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any action that would
cause Parent or the Surviving Corporation to disclose any confidential
information subject to non-disclosure agreements with third parties to each
other or to any third party in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
breach such agreements with third parties. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that any such confidential information is not disclosed to each other or to
any third party in a manner that would reasonably be expected to breach such
agreements with third parties, by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, or any of their respective employees. If any such confidential
information is disclosed to the other party or to any third party (by
mistake, or otherwise), in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
breach such agreements with third parties, the party receiving such
confidential information shall promptly notify the other party of such
disclosure and return such confidential information to the other party.  
5.19 Company Repurchases. The Company will exercise any rights that mature
between the date hereof and the Effective Time to repurchase any outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock at the price at which such shares were
issued.   5.20 Information Technology Access. Subject in all cases to
the Company\'s obligations of confidentiality with respect to third-
party confidential information, in furtherance of Section 5.3 and to
facilitate prompt integration following the Closing of the Company\'s
information technology ("IT") inventory (e.g., voice and data network
services and software and hardware, licenses, financial/accounting software,
IT budgets, etc.) with Parent\'s, the Company will, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, provide Parent and its Representatives with
access to the Company\'s IT inventory, as well as the Company\'s personnel
responsible for such IT inventory. Because of the substantial lead time that
may be required to order and install new software and hardware to integrate
the Company\'s IT systems with Parent\'s, and the importance of a smooth
integration of such IT systems promptly after the Closing, the Company agrees
that Parent may order, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, either in Parent\'s name or, if required by the vendor, the Company\'s
name, any new IT services, hardware and software that Parent believes will be
needed at the Company\'s facilities in order to coordinate Parent\'s and the
Company\'s respective operations following the Closing. The Company, between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, will cooperate with Parent
in the installation of such IT systems, hardware and software prior to and in
anticipation of the Closing, including providing Parent with reasonable
access to and use of appropriate Company personnel. If required by the
vendor, at Parent\'s request, the Company, between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, will place IT systems, hardware and software orders in
the Company\'s name. For clarity, it is the parties\' intent not to connect
any of the ordered services or systems prior to the Closing. Parent and the
Company agree to cooperate, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, with each other to minimize any potential disruption to
the Company\'s business from the IT integration efforts; provided, however,
that Parent will not have any liability to the Company for any such
disruption or as may otherwise result from the IT integration efforts, except
as may be directly caused by Parent\'s gross negligence or willful
misconduct; and provided further that in no event will Parent have any
liability to the Company for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special
or speculative damages, including damages for loss of profits or use,
business interruption or loss of goodwill, irrespective of whether such
damages arise under contract, tort, statute or otherwise and whether or not
the Company has given Parent advance notice of the possibility of such
damages. If the   -57-  65 Closing does not occur, other than because of
the Company\'s breach of this Agreement, Parent will reimburse the Company
for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by it in
connection with the ordering and installation of IT services, hardware and
software. If Parent is so required to reimburse the Company, Parent will own
any such hardware and software and will pay for its removal from Company
premises. Parent and the Company will cooperate in the removal of any such
hardware or software so as to minimize any disruption to the Company\'s
business. In addition, if the Closing does not occur, the Company will
cooperate with Parent in canceling any orders for IT services, hardware or
software and will otherwise act to minimize the costs which might be incurred
in connection with the IT integration efforts.   5.21 Intellectual Property.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice that any Person shall have (a)
commenced, or shall have notified the Company that it intends to commence, an
Action or Proceeding or (b) provided the Company with notice, in either case
which allege(s) that any of the Intellectual Property, including the Company
Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or proposed to be embodied, in the
Company\'s products or utilized in any development tools (including standard
cells) or design environments designed or modified by the Company infringes
or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of such Person, is
available for licensing from a potential licensor providing the notice or
otherwise alleges that the Company does not otherwise own or have the right
to exploit such Intellectual Property, including the Company Intellectual
Property.   5.22 Delivery of Stock Ledger and Minute Book of the Company.
The Company shall deliver its stock ledger and minute book to Parent at the
Closing.   5.23 New Hires; Top-Up Grants. Grants by the Company of Company
Options to new employees or of additional Company Options to existing
employees following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, in each
case in excess of the amounts reflected on the Company Disclosure Schedule as
being outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, if requested or approved
by Parent, shall be supported by additional shares of Parent Common Stock (in
excess of the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable under this
Agreement) reserved or otherwise made available for such purpose by Parent on
or after the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 5.23 shall be construed to
permit any grant by the Company of Company Options that would violate the
provisions of that certain Loan Agreement dated as of August 24, 2000 among
the Company, Anantakotiraju Vegesna , the Lenders named therein and Bank of
America, N.A., as administrative agent, as may be amended from time to
time.   ARTICLE 6  CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER   6.1 Conditions to

WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS;  ESCROW PROVISIONS   7.1 Survival of
Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. Notwithstanding any
right of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the affairs of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (whether
pursuant to Section 5.3 or otherwise) or a waiver by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company of any condition to Closing set forth in Article 6, each
party shall have the right to rely fully upon the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except
for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.17 (which shall
survive the Merger and continue until the eighteen-month anniversary of the
Closing Date), all of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Merger and continue until the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Expiration Date"). For the avoidance of doubt, each provision of
Article 1 and all corresponding Schedules shall survive until the
satisfaction of all obligations described therein, and each provision of
Article 9 and Article 10 shall survive so long as it is relevant to any other
surviving provision. Except with respect to Losses timely claimed pursuant to
Section 7.2(e), no action or proceeding may be instituted to enforce, or seek
damages or other remedies with respect to the breach of any representation or
warranty after the expiration of the period of survival for such
representation or warranty as described above. Subject to the preceding
sentence, the Stockholder Agent and the stockholders of the Company shall
have all remedies available at law or in equity against Parent to compensate
them and their employees, agents, and Affiliates for any and all Losses
(whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim), incurred or sustained by any
of them as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach (or any claim by
any third party alleging or constituting an inaccuracy or breach) of
any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub, as of the date of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, contained in this Agreement or in the
Ancillary Agreements or any other instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement.   7.2 Escrow
Provisions.   (a) Establishment of the Escrow Fund. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an Earn Out Delivery Date or
an Option Exercise Date, as the case may be, the applicable portion of the
Escrow Fund, without any act of any stockholder, will be deposited with the
Depositary Agent (plus any additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be
issued in respect of the Escrow Fund upon any stock splits, non-taxable stock
dividends or recapitalizations effected by Parent following the Effective
Time), such deposits to constitute the "Escrow Fund" to be governed by the
terms set forth herein. The Escrow Fund shall be increased and the
Unexercised Escrow shall be decreased to the extent that a deposit is made,
pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii)(y), into the Escrow Fund upon the exercise of
a Company Option or a Company Warrant. Notwithstanding the references in this
Agreement to the "escrow" and the Escrow Fund, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the Depositary Agent is acting as a depositary and not as an
escrow agent pursuant to this Article 7. Additionally, the Unexercised Escrow
shall be increased by any additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be
issued in    -63-  71  respect of the Unexercised Escrow upon any stock
splits, non-taxable stock dividends or recapitalizations effected by Parent
following the Effective Time.   (b) Recourse to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow
Amount shall be available to compensate Parent, its officers, directors,
employees, agents and Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent Indemnitees") for
any and all Losses (whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim), incurred
or sustained by Parent or any other Parent Indemnitee as a result of (i) any
inaccuracy in or breach (or any claim by any third party alleging or
constituting an inaccuracy or breach) of any representation or warranty of
the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, contained in this Agreement or
in the Ancillary Agreements or any other instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement; (ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, contained in the Sections of this Agreement set forth on Schedule
7.2(b)(ii); (iii) any intentional or reckless breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company, on the Closing Date, contained in the Sections of
this Agreement set forth on Schedule 7.2(b)(iii); (iv) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement (except for
the covenants of the Company set forth in the first three sentences of
Section 4.1) the Ancillary Agreements or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement; (v) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement arising out of
third-party confidential information, not previously disclosed to Parent
based upon the Company\'s confidentiality obligations to third parties, that
has a material adverse effect in the Business or the Condition of the
Company; (vi) any redemption, repurchase or other right to purchase shares of
Company Capital Stock exercised prior to the date of this Agreement (other
than pursuant to the Company Stock Plans); (vii) the inclusion of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the Tax returns of any other Person prior to the
Closing Date or (viii) one half of any payments or royalties owed (net of any
offset to other royalty obligations) with respect to the first item set forth
in Section 2.17(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the Closing;
provided, however, that, except in the case of claims for Losses resulting
from a breach, violation or inaccuracy in or omission from any of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.3 or as
modified or supplemented by Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure, Parent may
not make any claims against the Escrow Amount unless the aggregate Losses
incurred or sustained exceed $1,500,000 (at which such time claims may be
made for all Losses incurred or sustained in excess of such amount). The
dollar threshold set forth in the immediately preceding proviso shall not
apply to Losses resulting from any breach, violation or inaccuracy in or
omission from any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Section 2.3 or Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which
shall be recoverable without respect to any threshold amount to the extent
that such Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies existing
at the Effective Time, which if resolved at the Effective Time would have led
to a reduction in the aggregate Merger consideration to be paid to
the Company Stockholders. The Company Stockholders shall not have any
liability under this Agreement of any sort whatsoever in excess of the Escrow
Amount, except (x) in the event of fraud or willful misconduct by the Company
of any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained
in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or in any other instrument or
document required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement in connection
herewith or (y) with respect to the indemnification obligations in Section
7.2(b)(vi). Insofar as a Loss is claimed, after the Escrow Fund has been
distributed to the Company Stockholders, under (x) Section 7.2(b)(i) relating
to a breach of Section 2.17 or Section 7.2(b)(iii) relating to a breach of
Section 2.17, or (y) Section 7.2(b)(iv), Section 7.2(b)(v) or Section
7.2(b)(vii) or Section    -64-  72  7.2(b)(viii), the Company
Stockholders shall be liable for such Losses (A) up to, but not in the
aggregate in excess of (for all such Losses and all Company Stockholders) the
released portion of the Escrow Amount and (B) subject to the procedures set
forth in this Article 7. In the event of such a fraudulent breach, Parent
shall have all remedies available at law or in equity (including for tort)
with respect to such breach. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall any stockholder of
the Company have any liability of any sort in excess of the Merger
consideration received by such stockholder in connection with the Merger or
the proceeds, if any, received by such stockholder in connection with the
disposition of such Merger consideration.   (c) Escrow Period; Distribution
of Escrow Fund upon Termination of Escrow Period. Subject to the following
requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the
Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time upon the first
date upon which (i) there are no assets in the Escrow Fund and (ii) it is not
possible that any future deposits will be made into the Escrow Fund (the
period of time from the Effective Time through and including such first date
and time is referred to as the "Escrow Period"). All shares of Parent Common
Stock and any other securities, property, rights or privileges remaining in
the Escrow Fund at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the Expiration Date shall be
distributed at such time as set forth in the last sentence of this Section
7.2(c); provided, however, that the amount of such assets equal to the Funded
Fraction of the sum of all Reasonable Amounts with respect to all Asserted
Claims as of the Expiration Date shall not be distributed, but instead shall
be retained in the Escrow Fund. The "Funded Fraction" as of any date of
determination shall mean the fraction having as its numerator the amount of
the Escrow Fund as of such date and as its denominator the total amount of
the Escrow Amount as of such date. The "Reasonable Amount" with respect to
any claim shall equal the amount necessary in the reasonable judgment of
Parent, subject to the objection of the Stockholder Agent and the subsequent
arbitration of the matter in the manner as provided in Section 7.2(g), to
satisfy such claim. An "Asserted Claim" as of any date shall mean
an unsatisfied claim under this Section 7.2 (brought within the applicable
time limits specified in Section 7.1) concerning facts and circumstances
existing prior to such date, which claim is specified in any Officer\'s
Certificate timely delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to such date. As
soon as any such Asserted Claim, if any, has been resolved, the Depositary
Agent shall deliver to the stockholders of the Company their respective
shares of the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund in excess of the Funded
Fraction of the sum of the Reasonable Amounts for all Asserted Claims as of
such date. As soon as there are no remaining unsatisfied Asserted Claims, the
entire remaining balance of the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with the last sentence of this
Section 7.2(c). Deliveries of shares of Parent Common Stock and any other
securities, property, rights or privileges remaining in the Escrow Fund to
the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 7.2(c) shall be made
as set forth in Section 1.10(a)(iii). Each Company Stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock in
connection with such delivery (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder in connection with such
delivery) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (a) such
fraction, multiplied by (b) the Closing Price. Parent and the Depository
Agent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to have such shares and
other distributable items delivered within five (5) Business Days after
such resolution and in any event shall cause such distribution to occur in
full no later than thirty (30) calendar days after such resolution.   
-65-  73   (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.   (i) The Depositary Agent
shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall
treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall hold and dispose of the
Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof.   (ii) Any shares of
Parent Common Stock or other Equity Equivalents securities issued or
distributed by Parent ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund, or in the
Unexercised Escrow which have not been released from the Unexercised Escrow,
shall be added to the Escrow Fund or the Unexercised Escrow, as the case may
be. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have
been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but
shall be distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends and other
taxable property distributions on Parent Common Stock shall not be added to
the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders of the Parent
Common Stock on the record date set for any such dividend.   (iii) Each
stockholder shall have voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund with respect to such stockholder
(and on any voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such
shares of Parent Common Stock).   (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.   (i) Upon
receipt by the Depositary Agent at any time on or before the last day of the
Escrow Period and within the applicable survival period specified in Section
7.1, of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an "Officer\'s
Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent or another Parent Indemnitee has paid
or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or
accrue Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of any item specified in
Section 7.2(b)(i) through Section 7.2(b)(viii), inclusive, (or any claim by
any third party alleging, constituting or involving any such item), and (B)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included
in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly
accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, the claimant or payee,
if any, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
agreement or covenant, if any, to which such item is related, the Depositary
Agent shall, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph and to the
provisions of Section 7.2(f), reduce the Escrow Fund and credit Parent with a
portion of the Unexercised Escrow in a total amount equal to such Losses. The
Depositary shall allocate such reduction between the Escrow Fund and the
Unexercised Escrow in the same proportion as the Escrow Fund and the
Unexercised Escrow bear to the Escrow Amount as of the date of such
reduction. The Depositary Agent shall deliver to Parent out of the Escrow
Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock held in the
Escrow Fund equal to such reduction in the Escrow Fund. Additionally,
the Parent shall be entitled to receive the portion of the Escrow Fund
attributable to any portion of the Unexercised Escrow, which on an Option
Exercise Date, is reduced to the extent of a deposit into the Escrow Fund.
Furthermore, to the extent that there are not sufficient assets in the Escrow
Amount to reimburse or cover such Losses at the time such timely claim is
made, then future assets deposited or credited to the Escrow Amount, if
any,    -66-  74  shall be delivered to Parent until the total amount of
such Losses has been reimbursed or covered (including by credit against the
Unexercised Escrow). Where the basis for a claim upon the Escrow Amount by
Parent is that Parent reasonably anticipates that it will pay or accrue a
Loss, no payment or credit will be made from the Escrow Amount for such Loss
unless and until such Loss is actually paid or accrued.   (ii) For the
purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
delivered or credited to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
7.2(e)(i), the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at the Closing
Price.   (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any
Officer\'s Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder Agent and for a period of
thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Depositary Agent shall not reduce
the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 7.2(e) unless the Depositary Agent
shall have received written authorization from the Stockholder Agent to make
such reduction. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the
Depositary Agent shall reduce the Escrow Amount in accordance with Section
7.2(e), provided that no such reduction may be made if the Stockholder Agent
shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s
Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Depositary
Agent prior to the expiration of such 30 day period.   (g) Resolution of
Conflicts; Arbitration.   (i) In case the Stockholder Agent shall object in
writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer\'s Certificate, the
Stockholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Stockholder Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished
to the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and reduce the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms
thereof and thereafter comply with Section 7.2(e).   (ii) If no such
agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the
Stockholder Agent may demand arbitration of the dispute unless the amount of
the damage or loss is at issue in a pending Action or Proceeding involving a
Third-Party Claim, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until
such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in
either event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three
arbitrators, one selected by Parent and one selected by the Stockholder
Agent, and the two arbitrators selected by Parent and the Stockholder Agent
shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall set a limited time
period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for
discovery of information relating to any dispute while allowing the parties
an opportunity, adequate as determined in the sole judgment of
the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties
about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon
motions to compel, limit or allow discovery as they shall deem appropriate
given the nature and extent of the disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also
have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys\' fees and other
costs incurred by the parties, to the same extent as a court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to by a
party    -67-  75  without substantial justification. The decision of a
majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim
in such Officer\'s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(f),
the Depositary Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
decision and make or withhold reductions to the Escrow Amount in accordance
therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions regarding the dispute which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.   (iii)
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
the city and county of Los Angeles, California, except in the case of an
arbitration brought by Parent against the Company, Surviving Company,
any Company Stockholder or Stockholder Agent which shall be held in the city
or county of Santa Clara, under the commercial rules of arbitration then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section
7.2(g), (i) in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount
thereof stated in the Officer\'s Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be
deemed to be the "Non-Prevailing Party" in the event that the arbitrators
award Parent less than or equal to the sum of one-half of the disputed amount
of any Losses plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the stockholders of
the Company as represented by the Stockholder Agent shall be deemed to be the
Non-Prevailing Party and (ii) in any arbitration hereunder in which an Earn
Out is in dispute, Parent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in
the event that the arbitrators determine that more than or equal to the sum
of one-half of the disputed amount of any Earn Out Determination plus any
amounts not in dispute have been earned pursuant to the disputed Earn Out;
otherwise, the stockholders of the Company, as represented by the Stockholder
Agent, shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing
Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each
arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration and the expenses,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs, incurred by the other party
to the arbitration. Any claims by the Company\'s stockholders with respect to
Earn Out Shares shall be satisfied, if they prevail, by the issuance of new
shares of Parent Common Stock, and nothing in this paragraph, or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed to mean that any such claims
may be satisfied out of the Escrow Fund.   (h) Stockholder Agent of the
Stockholders; Power of Attorney.   (i) In the event that the this Agreement
is adopted by the stockholders of the Company, effective upon such vote, and
without further act of any Company Stockholder, Anantakotiraju Vegesna shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, be appointed as agent and attorney-
in-fact (the "Stockholder Agent") for the Company Stockholders (except such
stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or dissenters\'
rights under Delaware Law or the California Code, as applicable), for and on
behalf of the Company Stockholders, to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize reductions in the Escrow Amount, to determine,
object to and approve Earn Out Amounts, to authorize delivery to Parent of
shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims
by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Agent for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by
the Company Stockholders    -68-  76  from time to time upon not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that
the Stockholder Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds
interest in the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted stockholder agent. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Agent may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of
the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Agent, and the
Stockholder Agent shall not receive compensation for his services; provided,
however, the Stockholder Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement for his
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorney\'s
fees, incurred in performing his duties and functions hereunder, and shall be
entitled to withhold, sell and apply the proceeds of Parent Common Stock or
other assets otherwise distributable to Company Stockholders, including
amounts distributable at Closing, in such amounts as the Stockholder Agent
reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, toward the reimbursement of such
expenses and the establishment of reserves for future such expenses. Notices
or communications to or from the Stockholder Agent shall constitute, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, notice to or from each of the Company
Stockholders.   (ii) The Stockholder Agent shall not incur any liability
with respect to any action taken or suffered by him or omitted hereunder
as Stockholder Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment. The Stockholder Agent may, in all questions arising
hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Stockholder Agent based on such advice, the
Stockholder Agent shall not be liable to anyone. The Stockholder Agent
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement against the Stockholder Agent.   (iii) The
Stockholder Agent shall have reasonable access to information about the
Company and Parent, and shall also have the reasonable assistance of the
Company\'s and Parent\'s officers and employees for purposes of performing
its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Stockholder
Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information
from or about the Company or Parent to anyone (except on a need to know basis
to individuals who agree in writing to treat such information confidentially)
without prior consent of Company or Parent, as the case may be.   (i)
Actions of the Stockholder Agent. A decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
constitute a decision of all of the Company Stockholders for whom a
portion of the Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to them is deposited in
the Escrow Fund and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be final,
binding and conclusive upon each Company Stockholders. The Depositary Agent
and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
every such Company Stockholder. The Depositary Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from any liability to any
person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent.   (j) Third-Party Claims.
In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim (a "Third-Party
Claim") which Parent reasonably expects may result in a demand against the
Escrow Amount, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Agent of such claim, and
the Stockholder    -69-  77  Agent, as representative for the Company
Stockholders, shall be entitled, at the Company Stockholders\' expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its
sole discretion to settle any Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that if
Parent settles any Third-Party Claim without the Stockholder Agent\'s consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Parent may not make a claim against the Escrow Amount with respect to the
amount of Losses incurred by Parent in such settlement. In the event that the
Stockholder Agent has consented to any such settlement, the Stockholder Agent
shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this
Article 7 to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow Amount with
respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Parent in such settlement.  
(k) Indemnification for Stockholder Agent. The Company Stockholders shall,
severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based on their proportionate
beneficial ownership interests in the Company, indemnify, defend and hold the
Stockholder Agent harmless from and against any loss, damage, tax, liability
and expense that may be incurred by the Stockholder Agent arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Stockholder Agent\'s duties, except as caused by the Stockholder Agent\'s
willful misconduct, including the legal costs and expenses of defending such
Stockholder Agent against any claim or liability in connection with the
performance of the Stockholder Agent\'s duties. The Stockholder Agent shall
be entitled, but not limited, to such indemnification from the Escrow Fund
prior to any distribution thereof to the Company Stockholders, but after any
distributions therefrom to Parent, and shall also be entitled without
limitation to enforce such indemnity in accordance with Section
7.2(h)(i).   (l) Depositary Agent\'s Duties.   (i) The Depositary Agent
shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are
specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Depositary Agent may receive after the date of
this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder
Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from
acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Depositary Agent
shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Depositary Agent
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and
any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.   (ii) The Depositary Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to comply with and obey Orders of any court of law or Governmental
or Regulatory Authority, notwithstanding any notices, warnings or other
communications from any party or any other person to the contrary. In case
the Depositary Agent obeys or complies with any such Order, the Depositary
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person
by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such Order being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to
have been entered without jurisdiction or proper authority.   (iii) The
Depositary Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of (A) the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to    -70-  78  execute or deliver this Agreement or any
documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder; or (B) the expiration
of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement
or any documents deposited with the Depositary Agent.   (iv) In performing
any duties under the Agreement, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to
any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent
shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or
omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon
any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in
this Agreement that the Depositary Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Depositary Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Depositary Agent may consult with
legal counsel in connection with the Depositary Agent\'s duties under this
Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered,
or permitted by him, her or it in good faith in accordance with the advice
of counsel. The Depositary Agent is not responsible for determining and
verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf
of any party to this Agreement.   (v) If any controversy arises between the
parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject
matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Depositary Agent will
not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding
it. The Depositary Agent may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common
Stock (and any other securities, cash or property in its possession) and may
wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal
proceedings or other means as, in the Depositary Agent\'s discretion, the
Depositary Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement. In such event, the Depositary Agent will not be liable for
any damages. Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may at its option, file an
action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any
claims and rights among themselves. The Depositary Agent is authorized to
deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Parent Common
Stock (and any other securities, cash or property) held in escrow, except all
costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the Depositary Agent due to the interpleader action and which the parties
jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the
Depositary Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all
obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.   (vi)
Parent and its successors and assigns agrees to indemnify and hold the
Depositary Agent harmless against any and all Losses incurred by the
Depositary Agent in connection with the performance of the
Depositary Agent\'s duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to
any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject
matter.   (vii) The Depositary Agent may resign at any time upon giving
at least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided, however,
that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a
successor depositary agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the
parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree on
a successor depositary agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such
notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor depositary agent within
such time, the Depositary Agent    -71-  79  shall have the right to
appoint a successor depositary agent authorized to do business in the State
of California. The successor depositary agent shall execute and deliver an
instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be
vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the
predecessor depositary agent as if originally named as Depositary Agent. The
Depositary Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability
under this Agreement.   (m) All fees of the Depositary Agent for performance
of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent. In the event that the
conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Depositary
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the
parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Depositary Agent is made a party to, or
intervenes in, any Action or Proceeding pertaining to this escrow or its
subject matter, the Depositary Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney\'s fees, and
expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or Action or
Proceeding. Parent agrees to pay these sums upon demand.   ARTICLE 8

(ii) in any solicitation of stockholder written consents with respect to the
adoption of this Agreement, within twenty-five (25) days after the record
date established for determining the stockholders of the Company entitled to
consent;   (h) by Parent, if any of the individuals listed on Schedule
6.3(g) cease to be employed by the Company, provided, however, that Parent
may exercise this termination right with respect to a particular individual
named in Schedule 6.3(g) only if Parent gives the Company written notice of
termination of the Agreement within five (5) days after receipt of written
notice from the Company that such individual has ceased to be employed by the
Company; or   (i) by Parent, if, at any time prior to the Closing, more than

development employees employed as of the date of    -73-  81  this

be employed by the Company or if more than ten percent (10%) of such
employees shall have given any notice or other indication that they are not

Agreement.   8.3 Amendment. Except as is otherwise required by applicable
law after the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, this
Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto;
provided, however, that the consent of the Stockholder Agent and the
Depositary Agent shall not be required in connection with any amendment to
this Agreement that does not affect the rights and obligations of the
Stockholder Agent (or any of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Options, or Company Warrants who are represented by the Stockholder Agent) or
the Depositary Agent, as applicable.   8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time
prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company may (but

party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
