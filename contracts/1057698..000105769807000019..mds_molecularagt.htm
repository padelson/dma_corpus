      that
      Acquisition Sub make a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding
      Company Shares upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

          Each
          Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
          Code
          has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable)
          from the IRS stating that such Company Plan is so qualified, and to the
          knowledge of the Company, no fact exists that would lead to a revocation
          of such
          letter or disqualification of such Company Plan. Each Company Plan is being
          operated in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
          Requirements, except where the failure to operate in such compliance would
          not
          be material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            confidential information has not been previously furnished by the Company
            to

            the
            Company or the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors may accept such Superior Proposal
            and may enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal.

            all lawful action to solicit such adoption, except to the extent that
            the

            Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to the Company&#8217;s stockholders.

            risk of a breach by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to

            Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of Parent&#8217;s other Affiliates will be voted in

            asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective

            of any such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry:
            (A)
            Parent will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective
            Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof,
            Parent will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified
            Party&#8217;s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B)

            counsel retained by the Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense
            thereof
            for any period after the Acceptance Time must be reasonably satisfactory
            to
            Parent; and (C) Parent will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
            counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received; provided, however,
            that no Indemnified Party will be liable for any settlement effected
            without his
            express written consent. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain
            only one
            law firm (in addition to local counsel) to represent them with respect
            to any
            single action unless counsel for any Indemnified Party determines in
            good faith
            that, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
            exists or
            is reasonably likely to arise on any material issue between the positions
            of any
            two or more Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
            contained in this Section 5.10(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent
            agrees
            that it will not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
            judgment or
            otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, Legal Proceeding,
            arbitration, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be
            sought
            under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
            includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all
            liability
            arising out of such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation
