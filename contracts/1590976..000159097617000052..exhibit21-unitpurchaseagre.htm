THIS UNIT PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of June 28, 2017
(the "Agreement Date"), by and among Malibu Boats, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Buyer"); Cobalt Boats, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Company"); each of William Paxson St. Clair, Jr.; Mary Whitney
Callan; and FE II, Inc., a Kansas corporation (collectively, the "Unitholders"
or "Sellers"); and, with respect to those provisions set forth above their
respective signatures below, each of William Paxson (Pack) St. Clair, Jill St.
Clair, Sean Callan, William Paxson St. Clair Trust (the "Pack Trust"), Jill
Petrie St. Clair Trust (the "Jill Trust"), St. Clair Cellars, LLC, a Kansas
limited liability company, and Malibu Boats, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
Each of the foregoing is referred to as a "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties."

Background

A. The Company has a total of 63,053 units issued and outstanding, 972 of
which are Series A Preferred Units, of which 695 are owned by William Paxson
St. Clair, Jr. and 277 are owned by Mary Whitney Callan (collectively, the
"Preferred Units"), and 62,081 of which are common units owned by FE II, Inc.,
a Kansas corporation ("Common Units," and collectively with the Preferred
Units, the "Units"); and

B. Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to
Buyer, all of the Units of the Company in exchange for the consideration as
set forth in this Agreement.

Agreement

In consideration of the mutual promises in this Agreement, and in
consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth
below, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Purchase and Sale

1.1 Purchase and Sale of Units. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Sellers will sell, assign,
transfer, and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and acquire from
Sellers, the Units and all of their right, title and interest therein, free
and clear of all Liens.

1.2 Purchase Price. Subject to the other provisions of Article 1, the
aggregate consideration for all of the Units payable at the Closing, which is
referred to as the "Purchase Price," will equal the result of the following,
determined using the calculations of the Purchase Price Components pursuant to
Section 1.3:

(a) The Base Purchase Price, plus

(b) the Closing Cash, plus

(c) the Working Capital Surplus (if any), minus

(d) the Working Capital Shortfall (if any), minus

(e) the Earnout Payments, minus 

(f) the Closing Indebtedness, minus

(g) the FAR Payments, minus

(h) the Company Transaction Cost, minus

(i) the Pontoon Adjustment.

1.3 Reference Balance Sheet; Working Capital; Debt Payoff Letters.

(a) Reference Balance Sheet. At least 3 business days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company will prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a preliminary
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the open of business on the Closing Date (the "Reference Balance Sheet"), (ii)
a good faith estimate of the amount and calculation of the Closing Working
Capital, each of the Purchase Price Components and the Purchase Price and
accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company to
that effect (the items in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Estimated
Closing Statement"), and (iii) the Allocation Schedule. The Company will
prepare the Reference Balance Sheet in accordance with the Accounting
Standards. Buyer shall have the right to review the Estimated Closing
Statement and such supporting documentation or data as Buyer may reasonably
request and to discuss them with the Company; provided that the failure to
include in the Estimated Closing Statement any changes proposed by Buyer, or
the acceptance by Buyer of the Estimated Closing Statement, or the
consummation of the Closing, shall not limit or otherwise affect Buyer's
rights under this Agreement, including to include such changes or other
changes in the Closing Statement (in accordance with this Agreement), or
constitute an acknowledgment by Buyer of the accuracy of the Estimated Closing
Statement.

(b) Working Capital. If the Closing Working Capital is less than $4,622,250
(the "Working Capital Target"), the amount by which the Closing Working
Capital is less than the Working Capital Target is referred to as the "Working
Capital Shortfall". If the Closing Working Capital is greater than the Working
Capital Target, the amount by which the Closing Working Capital is greater
than the Working Capital Target is referred to as the "Working Capital
Surplus".

(c) Debt Payoff Letters. At least three business days prior to the Closing,
the Company shall provide to Buyer customary, fully-executed payoff letters in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer ("Debt Payoff Letters")
with respect to all Indebtedness under the Debt Arrangements, setting forth
the amounts required to repay all such Indebtedness owing as of the Closing
(including principal, premiums, interest, fees and other charges) ("Debt
Payoff Amounts"). 

1.4 Payment of Purchase Price; Escrow Release.

(a) Payment of Purchase Price. At the Closing, Buyer will pay or cause to be
paid to Sellers, apportioned among them as specified in a schedule that sets
forth (x) such apportionment, (y) the calculations thereof, and (z) each
Seller's Pro Rata Interest (the "Allocation Schedule"), an aggregate amount in
cash equal to the Purchase Price (for clarity, determined using the
calculations of the Purchase Price Components pursuant to Section 1.3) less
(i) $1,000,000 (the "Purchase Price Escrow Amount"), (ii) 1.0% of the Base
Purchase Price (the "Indemnity Escrow Amount" and together with the Purchase
Price Escrow Amount, the "Escrow Amounts") and (iii) $1,000,000 (the "MBUU
Share Amount"), and will deposit or cause to be deposited with BNY Mellon,
National Association (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 1.4(a) (the "Escrow Agreement"), the
Escrow Amounts, which the Escrow Agent will hold in separate escrow accounts
(the "Purchase Price Escrow Account" and the "Indemnity Escrow Account",
respectively) and disburse in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement. Buyer will make all payments by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such bank accounts as Sellers or the Escrow
Agent designate in writing, as applicable, at least three business days prior
to the Closing Date. Sellers agree that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the
Allocation Schedule, Buyer has no obligation to investigate, verify or confirm
any item set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and Buyer shall have no
liability to any Person for following or relying on the matters set forth on
the Allocation Schedule.

(b) Escrow Accounts. The interest, earnings and income that accrues upon the
Escrow Amounts, if any, during the period of time during which they are held
in the Escrow Accounts shall be deemed to become part of the applicable Escrow
Amount. The release of funds from each Escrow Account shall be governed by the
Escrow Agreement and the terms of this Agreement. For Tax reporting purposes,
all such interest, earnings and income, if any, shall be reported for tax
purposes as belonging to Buyer, and Buyer and Sellers shall (promptly after
Buyer's request) direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Buyer a
corresponding Tax distribution from the applicable Escrow Account sufficient
to pay the applicable Taxes owing in respect of a corporation resident in
Tennessee.

(c) Escrow Release.

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Purchase Price Escrow Release. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any
event within three business days) after the Closing Working Capital and each
of the Purchase Price Components have become final and binding in accordance
with Section 1.5, Buyer and Sellers shall direct the Escrow Agent to release
to Sellers in accordance with their relative Pro Rata Interests all of the
remaining Purchase Price Escrow Amount, if any, in excess of any portion of
the Purchase Price Escrow Amount that is to be released by the Escrow Agent to
Buyer to settle the payment of any Overstatement pursuant to Section
1.5(d)(ii). 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Indemnity Escrow Release. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
within three business days) following the date that is 12 months after the
Closing Date (the "Indemnity Escrow Period"), Buyer and Sellers shall direct
the Escrow Agent to distribute the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, if
any, to Sellers in accordance with their relative Pro Rata Interests in excess
of any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (the "Retained Amount")
calculated pursuant to the following sentence with respect to all unresolved
claims by Buyer Parties for Losses specified in any indemnity notice delivered
to Sellers before the expiration of the Indemnity Escrow Period (the
"Unresolved Claims"). If there are any Unresolved Claims as of the expiration
of the Indemnity Escrow Period, then all or a portion (as applicable) of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount that equals the total amount of Losses then being
claimed by Buyer Parties in all such Unresolved Claims shall be retained in
the Indemnity Escrow Account, and as soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event within three business days) following resolution of each such
Unresolved Claim and the payment of all Losses required to be paid in
connection with the resolution of each such Unresolved Claim from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, Buyer and Sellers shall direct the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Sellers in accordance with their relative Pro Rata Interests any
portion of the remaining amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account, if any, in
excess of the Retained Amount for all of the remaining Unresolved Claims. 

1.5 Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Closing Date Balance Sheet. As soon as practicable and in any event no
later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and
delivered to Sellers (i) the final unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the open of business on the Closing Date
(the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and (ii) the amount and calculation of the
Closing Working Capital, each of the Purchase Price Components and the
Purchase Price (but, for clarity, determined using Buyer's calculations of the
Purchase Price Components pursuant to this Section 1.5(a) in lieu of the
estimates of the Purchase Price Components determined pursuant to Section 1.3)
and accompanied by a certificate of an authorized officer of Buyer to that
effect (the items in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Closing
Statement"). Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared the Closing Date
Balance Sheet in accordance with the Accounting Standards.

(b) Statement of Objection. Unless within 30 calendar days after receipt of
the Closing Statement Sellers deliver to Buyer a statement describing their
objections to the Closing Statement (a "Statement of Objection"), the amount
of the Closing Working Capital and each of the Purchase Price Components and
the Purchase Price as reflected on the Closing Statement will be deemed final
and binding on the Parties. 

(c) Dispute Resolution.

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

If Sellers deliver to Buyer a timely Statement of Objection, Buyer and Sellers
and their respective independent accountants and financial or legal advisors
will attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute within 15 calendar days
after receipt by Buyer of such Statement of Objection. If Buyer and Sellers
are unable to resolve the dispute within 15 days, a nationally recognized
accounting firm mutually agreed to by such Parties (or if they cannot agree
within 10 days thereafter, an independent nationally recognized accounting
firm selected by the mutual agreement of the accounting firm designated by
Buyer and the accounting firm designated by FE II, Inc., or if they cannot
agree, an independent nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the
arbitrator pursuant to Section 12.8) (the "Arbitrator") will be retained to
resolve the matters remaining in dispute (the "Disputed Items") in a written
decision as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later than 30 days
after its retention. It is the intent of Buyer and Sellers that in connection
with the process set forth in this Section 1.5(c) and the activities of the
Arbitrator in connection therewith, no formal arbitration rules shall be
followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the scope of the
Arbitrator's engagement shall be limited to resolving the Disputed Items in
accordance with, and by application of, the terms (including the applicable
definitions) of this Agreement, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority
over any other disagreement (including questions of law, interpretation of
contract and fraud). Under no circumstances shall the Arbitrator award a
greater amount in respect of any Disputed Item than the amount in dispute. The
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator will be shared equally by Sellers and
Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Buyer and Sellers will furnish to the Arbitrator such available documents and
information relating to the Disputed Items (including the books and records of
the Cobalt Companies) as the Arbitrator may reasonably request to verify the
accuracy of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the determination of the
Closing Working Capital and each of the Purchase Price Components. The
determination of the Arbitrator as to the Closing Working Capital and each of
the Purchase Price Components will constitute an arbitral award that is final
and binding upon the Parties and the Escrow Agent and may be entered as a
judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. 

(d) Adjustment Payments. After the determination of the final Closing Working
Capital and Purchase Price Components in accordance with this Section 1.5, the
Purchase Price will be recomputed using such final Closing Working Capital and
Purchase Price Components in lieu of the estimates of the Purchase Price
Components determined pursuant to Section 1.3, and:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

If the calculation of the Purchase Price using such final Closing Working
Capital and Purchase Price Components exceeds the Purchase Price determined at
Closing (the amount of such excess is referred to as the "Understatement"),
then Buyer will pay the amount of the Understatement to Sellers in accordance
with their relative Pro Rata Interests within 10 days after the Closing
Working Capital and Purchase Price Components are finally determined. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

If the calculation of the Purchase Price using such final Closing Working
Capital and Purchase Price Components is less than the Purchase Price
determined at Closing (the amount of such difference is referred to as the
"Overstatement"), then the Parties will direct the Escrow Agent to disburse to
Buyer the amount of the Overstatement from the Purchase Price Escrow Account,
and, to the extent the amount in the Purchase Price Escrow Account is less
than the amount of the Overstatement, then Sellers will pay such shortfall to
Buyer, in each case, within 10 days after the Closing Working Capital and
Purchase Price Components are finally determined. 

1.6 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer (or its designees) shall be entitled to withhold and deduct, or cause to
be withheld and deducted, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

2. Closing.

2.1 The Closing; Closing Date. The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Units contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place by remote
communication at 9:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time on the second business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement set
forth in Article 6 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof at
the Closing) or such other time, place, and date as Buyer and Sellers may
mutually determine in writing; provided that the Closing shall in no event
occur before July 3, 2017 without the prior written consent of Buyer. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date". 

2.2 Deliverables at the Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Closing:

(a) Buyer will:

employees of the Cobalt Companies as of Closing, in each case, through its
payroll system no later than 10 days following the Closing Date, subject to
deduction for all amounts required or permitted to be withheld under any

security, unemployment or similar Tax in respect of such payments;

The Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to the lettered and numbered sections contained in this Article 3; provided, however, that a matter disclosed in reference to any particular section or subsection will be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of any other section or subsections of this Article 3, if the matter is disclosed in such a way to make its relevance to such other sections or subsections reasonably apparent from a plain text reading of such matter, but the mere inclusion or listing of a document shall not be adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty, unless the representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document itself. Except as otherwise provided in the Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

3.1 Organization and Corporate Power. Each Cobalt Company is duly organized,
validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of

the nature of its business or its ownership of property requires it to be
qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified would not be material.
Schedule 3.1 lists all of the jurisdictions in which the Cobalt Companies are
qualified to do business as a foreign entity. Each Cobalt Company has full
power and authority and all licenses, permits, and authorizations necessary to
own, lease, and operate its properties and business and to conduct its
business as currently conducted. True, complete and correct copies of the
Charter Documents of each Cobalt Company have been made available to Buyer. No

Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each such Ancillary Agreement, have been duly authorized by all
requisite action on the part of the Company, and no other proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to approve or authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and each such Ancillary Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each such
Ancillary Agreement, and this Agreement and each such Ancillary Agreement
constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms and conditions,

similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles
of equity (whether considered in proceedings at law or in equity)
(collectively, "Bankruptcy Exceptions").

3.3 Non-Contravention.

(a) No Breach. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3, neither the execution and
the delivery of this Agreement or each Ancillary Agreement to which the

otherwise bound;

any Governmental Authority or any other Person for the Parties to enter into
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for any notice, filing,
authorization, consent, or approval the absence of which could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material.

Party and no officer, manager, director, or Affiliate of any Cobalt Company

Property or any portion thereof, other than those described in clause (vi) of
the definition of Permitted Liens. Each of the Real Property Occupancy
Agreements is in full force and effect and, subject to Bankruptcy Exceptions,

nor, to the Company's knowledge, any other party thereto, is in material

any Company Property, whether latent or otherwise, and no Cobalt Company has
received any written notice from any insurance company or bonding company of
any defects or inadequacies in any Company Property, or any part thereof,

of extraordinary premiums or charges thereon or of any termination or
threatened termination of any policy of insurance or bond. Except as stated in
Schedule 3.12(g), all water, gas, electrical, steam, compressed air,
telecommunication, utility, sanitary and storm sewage lines and systems and
other similar systems serving the Company Properties are fully operational and

Release of a Hazardous Substance, material or waste to the environment at any
facility now operated by the Cobalt Companies (or any predecessor for which

subject to no valid defenses, counterclaims or rights of setoff or any claims
or disputes and, to the knowledge of the Company, are collectible in the
ordinary course of business, except in the case of notes and accounts
receivable shown on the Latest Balance Sheet, to the extent of the reserves
set forth on the face of the Latest Balance Sheet, and, in the case of

respects as of the date of the Latest Balance Sheet and have been determined

of the Cobalt Companies. Except as stated in Schedule 3.23, all inventories

ordinary course of business) of the Cobalt Companies are located on the
premises of a Cobalt Company.

such Person intends to terminate its relationship with the Cobalt Companies or
materially change the terms of its relationship with the Cobalt Companies

amount charged for the supply of certain materials, products or services) nor
has there been any material dispute with any such Person.

manner of sale, holding period, and on requirements relating to the Company
which are outside of such Unitholder's control, and which the Company is under
no obligation and may not be able to satisfy), and that such shares may not be
sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under applicable securities Laws or an
exemption from such registration under such Laws and applicable trading
blackout periods.

6.5 Business; Employees; Employee Plans.

(a) Except for employees who have been offered by Buyer written employment
agreements with the Company effective as of the Closing, during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date which is 12 months after
the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the date of the employee's termination of
employment with any Cobalt Company), Company and Buyer will, or will cause an
Affiliate, to provide each employee of any Cobalt Company who remains employed
immediately after the Closing (a "Continuing Employee") with base salary or
hourly wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided
by any Cobalt Company immediately prior to the Closing; provided that the
foregoing will not apply with respect to employees whose job titles or job
responsibilities are materially changed after Closing. 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer (a "Buyer
Employee Plan") in which any Continuing Employee will participate effective as
of the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause an Affiliate to, recognize all
service of Continuing Employees with any Cobalt Company as if such service
were with Buyer and its Affiliates, for vesting and eligibility purposes in
any Buyer Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date; provided, however, such service will not
be recognized to the extent (i) such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits, (ii) such service was not recognized under the corresponding
employee plan of any Cobalt Company as it existed prior to the Closing Date or
(iii) and for any reason under any defined benefit pension plan, retiree
medical benefit plan or any equity incentive award granted after the Closing.

Cobalt Companies will adopt, or will cause to be adopted, all necessary
corporate resolutions (which shall be subject to Buyer's reasonable review and
approval) to terminate each 401(k) Plan sponsored or maintained by the Cobalt
Companies, effective as of no later than one day prior to Closing (but such
termination may be contingent upon the Closing). Immediately prior to such
termination, the Cobalt Companies will have made all necessary payments to
fund the contributions: (i) necessary or required to maintain the Tax-
qualified status of the 401(k) Plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant
to the 401(k) Plan for the period prior to termination; and (iii) for any
employer contributions (including any matching contributions) for the period
prior to termination. For this purpose, the term "401(k) Plan" means any plan
intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) which includes a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Code Section 401(k). The Cobalt
Companies shall provide Buyer with a copy of resolutions duly adopted so
terminating any such 401(k) Plan. If any Cobalt Companies' 401(k) Plan is
terminated, Buyer shall cause a 401(k) Plan sponsored by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates to accept as soon as practicable rollover distributions from any
current or former employees of the Cobalt Companies with respect to such
individual's account balances under such terminated plan (including loans that
are not then in default), if elected by such individuals.

This Section 6.5 will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the Parties, and nothing in this Section, express or implied, will confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, will
be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement, or arrangement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the terms
set forth in this Section 6.5 will not create any right in any employee or any
other Person to any employment or continued employment with the Cobalt
Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever. 

6.6 Restrictive Covenants. As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into
this Agreement, each Restricted Party (other than Sean Callan) covenants and
agrees to the following:

(a) For the Restriction Period, such Restricted Party shall not, and shall not
permit any of the Affiliates of such Restricted Party to, directly or
indirectly, either alone or in association or in connection with or on behalf
of any Person now existing or hereafter created (except on behalf of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates): (i) be or become engaged in, or participate in, the
business of designing, developing, assembling, manufacturing, producing,
testing, marketing, selling, delivering or servicing boats or components
thereof (whether recreational, sports, or otherwise) ("Restricted Business")
anywhere in the world (the "Restricted Area"), including being or becoming,
directly or indirectly, an organizer, owner, operator, investor, lender,
lessor, partner, joint venturer, equityholder, officer, director, employee,
manager, representative, associate, advisor, consultant or agent of, in, to or

interest, or serving as a trustee or in a similar capacity, in any Person that
is, directly or indirectly, any of the foregoing or otherwise engaged in any
Restricted Business), (ii) use or authorize the use of such Restricted Party's
name or any part thereof in connection with any Restricted Business or (iii)
take any other action that is intended or designed, or would reasonably be
expected, to frustrate, circumvent or evade the provisions of this Section
6.6(a). Nothing in this Section 6.6(a) will prevent such Restricted Party from
beneficially holding a passive investment of up to 3% of any publicly-listed
class of securities of a Restricted Business.

(b) Without limiting Section 6.6(a), such Restricted Party shall not, and
shall not permit any of the Affiliates of such Restricted Party to, directly
or indirectly, either alone or in association or in connection with or on
behalf of any Person now existing or hereafter created, during the Restriction
Period, (i) divert or attempt to divert or solicit any business of, or
interfere with the relationship between (in each case, only to the extent
related to the Restricted Business), any Cobalt Company or its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and any Person who at any time during the 18 months preceding
the Closing Date was a customer, sales representative, supplier, dealer,
distributor, vendor, licensor, licensee, lessor, lessee, or other business
partner of any Cobalt Company, on the other hand or (ii) solicit or recruit
the employment or consulting services of or hire or engage any employee,
independent contractor or consultant of any Cobalt Company (including any such
employee, independent contractor or consultant who has voluntarily resigned
from employment with such Cobalt Company within six months of such
solicitation, recruitment, hiring or engagement), provided that this clause
(ii) shall not prohibit a general solicitation to the public of general
advertising not specifically directed at any such employee, independent
contractor or consultant so long as no such employee, independent contractor
or consultant is hired or engaged as a result of such general solicitation. 

(c) Such Restricted Party represents, warrants, acknowledges and agrees that:
(i) such Restricted Party is directly deriving substantial value and proceeds
from the transactions contemplated hereby (including, in the case of William
Paxson (Pack) St. Clair and Jill St. Clair, as owners of FE II, Inc.), (ii)
the restrictions applicable to such Restricted Party in this Section 6.6 are
necessary, fair, reasonable, fundamental and required for the protection of
the business, Trade Secrets and goodwill of the Cobalt Companies after the
Closing, (iii) such restrictions relate to matters that are of a special,
unique and extraordinary value, (iv) Buyer has required that such Restricted
Party agree to such restrictions, and such Restricted Party has voluntarily
agreed to such restrictions (v) Buyer would not consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby if such Restricted Party did not enter into such
restrictions, (vi) the obligations against such Restricted Party in this
Section 6.6 constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of such
Restricted Party and are enforceable against such Restricted Party in
accordance with their terms, and (vii) the obligations against such Restricted
Party in this Section 6.6 are cumulative with, and not in lieu of, any other
similar restrictions set forth in any agreement between a Cobalt Company or
any Affiliate thereof and such Restricted Party (including any employment,
consulting, confidentiality, inventions assignment, or similar agreement).

(d) Such Restricted Party agrees that a breach by such Restricted Party or any
Affiliate thereof of any covenant set forth in this Section 6.6 would cause
irreparable harm to Buyer, that Buyer's remedies at law upon any such breach
would be inadequate, and that, accordingly, upon any such breach, Buyer may
seek a restraining order or injunction or both to be issued against such
Restricted Party or such Affiliate, in addition to any other rights and
remedies which are available to Buyer at law or in equity. Such Restricted
Parties specifically agree that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.6
are reasonable, appropriate and narrowly-tailored but that if a court of
competent jurisdiction finds this Section 6.6 more restrictive than permitted
by the Laws of any jurisdiction in which Buyer seeks enforcement hereof, this
Section 6.6 will be limited to the extent required to permit maximum
enforcement thereof under such Laws. In particular, such Restricted Parties
intend that the covenants contained in the preceding portions of this Section
6.6 will be construed as a series of separate covenants, including one for
each country in the Restricted Area, one for each state, province or other
first-level political subdivision within each country in the Restricted Area
and one for each county or other second-level political subdivision in each
state, province, or other first-level political subdivision in the Restricted
Area. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant will be
deemed identical in terms. If, in any Proceeding, a court of competent
jurisdiction or arbitrator refuses to enforce any of the separate covenants
deemed included in this Section 6.6, then only such unenforceable covenant
will be deemed eliminated from these provisions for the purpose of such
Proceeding to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants
to be enforced. In addition, if a court of competent jurisdiction or
arbitrator refuses to enforce any of the covenants throughout the full length
of the Restriction Period, such Restricted Parties agree that the Restriction
Period will be deemed amended to the longest period that is permissible. In
addition, and without limiting any other remedies, the Restriction Period with
respect to a Restricted Party subject to this Section 6.6 shall be extended
for the period equal to the time period (if any) that such Restricted Party is
in breach of this Section 6.6. 

(e) The "Restriction Period" means the period of five years beginning with the
Closing Date.

6.7 Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Restricted Party, on behalf of
itself, its Affiliates and their respective executors, representatives,
successors and assigns, if any, irrevocably releases and discharges Buyer, the
Cobalt Companies and their respective officers, managers, directors,
equityholders, affiliates, employees, advisors and agents (collectively,
"Released Parties") from and against any and all claims, demands, damages,
Liabilities, agreements, costs, expenses (including attorneys' and
accountants' fees and expenses), Proceedings, actions and causes of action of
any nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
that such Restricted Party or its Affiliates or their respective executors,
representatives, successor or assigns now has, or at any time previously had,
or shall or may have in the future, or that were owed, are owed, or shall or
may in the future be owed to such Person, whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, and whether known or unknown, in any
case, arising out of or relating to any act, omission, event or circumstance
occurring prior to or existing as of the Closing relating to or arising out of
or in connection with any Cobalt Company or any action or inaction of any
Cobalt Company or such Person's relationship (whether related to employment,
ownership, or otherwise) with any Cobalt Company, including, for clarity, all
rights of such Person (if any) under the Limited Liability Company Agreement
(collectively, "Released Claims"), and irrevocably agrees to refrain from
directly or indirectly asserting or commencing any claim or demand of any kind
against any Released Party based upon any Released Claim. Each Restricted
Party confirms that it has not transferred or assigned any interest in any
Released Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Released Claims" does not
include: (a) any rights of the Restricted Parties in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement; (b) with respect to any Restricted Party that is a
current or former officer, director or manager of a Cobalt Company, any right
of such Restricted Party in their capacity as such to indemnification and
advancement of expenses under the Charter Documents of the Cobalt Companies or
under applicable Law; (c) any rights with respect to tail insurance coverage
policy obtained pursuant to Section 6.3; or (d) in the case of a Restricted
Party that is an employee, officer, director, or manager of a Cobalt Company,
any claim for accrued benefits under any Benefit Plan to which such Restricted
Party is entitled or unpaid salary for the current period. Each Restricted
Party acknowledges that it may hereafter discover facts in addition to, or
different from, those that such Restricted Party now knows or believes to be
true with respect to the subject matter of the foregoing release, and each
Restricted Party intends that such release shall be and remain in effect as a
full and complete release notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any
such additional or different facts. In furtherance of the foregoing intention,
each Restricted Party hereby waives and relinquishes any rights and benefits
that it may have as a Person granting a release under any applicable Law of
any jurisdiction to the full extent that it may lawfully waive all such rights
and benefits pertaining to the subject matter of the such release. 

6.8 RandW Insurance Policy. Promptly following issuance of the RandW Insurance
Policy, Buyer shall provide a complete copy thereof to Sellers. The RandW
Insurance Policy obtained by Buyer shall contain an irrevocable waiver of
subrogation by the insurer against Sellers and, in the case of FE II, Inc.,
its stockholders, and, unless prohibited by the RandW Insurance Policy, the
other Restricted Parties and all of their respective directors, officers,
affiliates, stockholders and unit holders (except in instances of fraud).
Buyer covenants and agrees that following Closing, Buyer will not amend or
modify the RandW Insurance Policy in any manner whatsoever that would adversely
affect Sellers with respect to such subrogation. Buyer covenants and agrees
that with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(1) or Section 9.2(a)(3) for which coverage may reasonably be available
under the RandW Insurance Policy, Buyer shall (a) give timely notice of that
claim for indemnification as required under the RandW Insurance Policy, (b)
comply in all material respects with all of the applicable terms and
conditions of the RandW Insurance Policy for which the failure to comply would
adversely affect Sellers and (c) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue coverage for such claim under the RandW Insurance Policy.

6.9 Efforts. Without limiting any obligations provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Company and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the other's conditions to Closing
set forth in Article 7 and cause the Closing to occur, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) file any notices and applications with
Governmental Authorities required to be made by it, (b) obtain any third-party
consents, approvals or other instruments required to be obtained by it
(including, in the case of the Company, those described in Section 2.2(b)(8)
and Section 7.1(f)), (c) in the case of the Company, seek a payoff letter in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer from all counterparties to
the Redemption Agreements who are not parties to this Agreement and (d) oppose
and have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other
order adversely affecting the ability of such Party to cause the Closing to
occur, and they shall reasonably cooperate with each other in respect of the
foregoing; provided that, for clarity, no such Party shall be required to
waive or otherwise compromise any condition to its obligations to consummate
the Closing. The Company and Buyer shall furnish to each other such
information (other than attorney-client or similarly privileged information)
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. Without Buyer's consent, the Company will not (and will not permit
any other Cobalt Company to), prior to the Closing, make any agreement to pay
any consideration after the Closing or post any security to a third party in
exchange for any such consent, approval, or instrument.

6.10 Notice of Developments. From the Agreement Date until the earlier to
occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 8.1, if any Party becomes aware of any fact, action,
circumstance, breach or event that would reasonably be likely to (a) result in
the failure of any other Party's condition to Closing set forth in Article 7
to be satisfied or (b) restrict or delay in any material respect the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, such Party shall give the
other Parties prompt written notice thereof. No information provided or
obtained pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall affect any representation or
warranty in this Agreement.

6.11 Exclusivity. From the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 8.1, except as set forth in Section 2.2(c), the Company and each
Restricted Party agree that they will not, and will cause their respective
directors, officers, managers, members, employees, agents, financing sources,
advisors or other representatives not to, directly or indirectly (a) solicit,
initiate or encourage any inquiry, proposal, offer or agreement from any
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates and representatives) relating to
any transaction involving (i) the sale, transfer or issuance of any Equity
Interest of any Cobalt Company or FE II, Inc., or the sale or transfer of any
assets of the Cobalt Companies that are collectively material (other than the
sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business), (ii) any acquisition,
divestiture, merger, share 

or unit exchange, consolidation, redemption, financing, refinancing, or
similar transaction involving a Cobalt Company or FE II, Inc. or (iii) any
other business combination involving a Cobalt Company or FE II, Inc. (in each
case, an "Acquisition Proposal") or (b) participate in any discussion or
negotiation regarding, or furnish any information with respect to, or assist
or facilitate in any manner, any Acquisition Proposal or any attempt to make
an Acquisition Proposal. Each Restricted Party and the Company shall
immediately cease, and cause to be terminated, any and all contacts,
discussions and negotiations between them or any Cobalt Company and any third
parties regarding any of the foregoing, and the Company will notify Buyer
promptly if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact related
to an Acquisition Proposal to any of them (or its directors, officers,
managers, members, employees, and agents) from the Agreement Date until the
earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to and in accordance with Section 8.1.

6.12 Financing. From the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance

agents and other representatives (including legal, financial and accounting
advisors) to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer and its
financing sources, agents and arrangers under the Debt Financing (as defined
below) and their respective former, current and future Affiliates, equity
holders, controlling persons, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors
and representatives involved in the Debt Financing (collectively, the

Sources financial and other non-privileged information regarding the Cobalt
Companies as may be reasonably requested by Buyer or the Financing Sources,

shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing); (d) to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer, assisting in Buyer's preparation of any
schedules thereto to the extent reflecting the Cobalt Companies and each of
their respective assets for the Debt Financing; and (e) facilitating the

(9)

|

any third-party claims relating to, arising out of or resulting from the
Pending Litigation. 

(b) Indemnification Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation
of Sellers to provide indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be
subject to the following limitations (provided that the following limitations
shall not apply to any claim involving fraud):

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

With respect to claims for indemnification by Buyer Parties under Section
9.2(a)(1) (other than in respect of Fundamental Representations), Sellers will
have no obligation to provide indemnification unless and until the aggregate
amount of Losses by the Buyer Parties under Section 9.2(a)(1) (other than in
respect of Fundamental Representations) exceeds 0.5% of the Base Purchase
Price (the "Threshold"), and then only for Losses in excess of the Threshold. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

To the extent that Sellers have any obligation or liability to a Buyer Party
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(1) (other than in respect of Fundamental
Representations and Excluded Representations), Sellers' total obligation or
liability therefor will not exceed 1.0% of the Base Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

(A) Sellers' total liability pursuant to (i) Section 9.2(a)(1) for Losses in
respect of Excluded Representations, (ii) Section 9.2(a)(7), and (iii) Section
9.2(a)(9) will not exceed 7.5% of the Base Purchase Price in the aggregate.
(B) Sellers' total liability with respect to claims made pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(7) on or before the fourth anniversary of the Closing ("First Period
Claims") will not exceed 6.0% of the Base Purchase Price in the aggregate. (C)
Sellers' total liability with respect to claims made pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(7) after the fourth anniversary of the Closing and on or before the
seventh anniversary of the Closing will not exceed 3.5% of the Base Purchase
Price in the aggregate (the "Second Period Cap"); provided that any final
liability of Sellers in respect of First Period Claims will reduce the Second
Period Cap dollar-for-dollar. (D) Sellers' total liability with respect to
claims made pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(8) will not exceed $25 million in the
aggregate. (E) Once (x) a Title Policy is issued to the Company pursuant to
Section 6.18(a) in respect of the Main Facility and (y) Sellers have been
liable for at least $10 million with respect to claims made pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(8) relating to the Main Facility, Sellers shall thereafter only
be liable for 50% of the amount of any Losses subject to indemnity pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(8) relating to the Main Facility. (F) With respect to each Real
Property other than the Main Facility, once a Title Policy is issued to the
Company pursuant to Section 6.18(a) in respect of such Real Property, Sellers
shall thereafter only be liable for 50% of the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(8) relating to such Real Property, except
that Sellers shall instead be liable for 100% of the amount of such Losses to
the extent such Losses result from or relate to any action by or on behalf of
any Cobalt Company or any of their 

owners prior to the Closing (including, for example, but without limitation,
any breach of Contract or violation of Law by any of them prior to Closing).

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

Without limiting the other limitations of this Section 9.2(b), each Seller's
total liability pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(1), Section 9.2(a)(3), Section
9.2(a)(4), and Section 9.2(a)(5) will not exceed in the aggregate the final
Purchase Price actually received by such Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

Without limiting the other limitations of this Section 9.2(b), to the extent
that coverage is available under the RandW Insurance Policy, no Seller will have
any liability pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(1) (other than in respect of Excluded
Representations) or pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(3), in any case, other than for
the then remaining portion of the Retention (as such term is defined in the
RandW Insurance Policy), unless and until the Limit of Liability (as such term
is defined in the RandW Insurance Policy) is met or exceeded. 

| 
---|--- 

(6)

|

The amount of Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Section
9.2 will be offset by (a) amounts that are reimbursable by and actually
recovered from insurance (net of any deductible or co-payment and all out of
pocket costs related to such recovery) and (b) any Tax benefits actually
realized by the Indemnified Party by reason of such Losses in the year in
which the corresponding indemnity payment is made or any prior year. 

(c) Sole Remedy. After the Closing, except for a Party's right to specific
performance or injunctive relief or for claims involving fraud, the indemnity
provisions contained in this Section 9.2 will be the Buyer Parties' sole and
exclusive remedy for any claim relating to breaches of this Agreement, other
than claims pursuant to Section 1.5 and other than claims against a Restricted
Party in respect of such Restricted Party's representations, warranties, or
covenants (other than pre-Closing covenants) in Section 6, Section 9.7 or
Section 10 of this Agreement. If any insurance proceeds or other amounts are
actually received by any Buyer Party of any amount previously paid by an
Indemnifying Party to such Buyer Party in respect of an indemnification claim
pursuant to this Section 9.2, such Buyer Party will repay to such Indemnifying
Party, promptly after receipt of such insurance proceeds or other amounts, the
amount that such Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
Section 9.2 had such insurance proceeds or other amounts been received by such
Buyer Party prior to such Indemnifying Party's payment under this Section 9.2
(net of any deductible or co-payment and all out of pocket costs related to
such recovery). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the right of the Buyer Parties to make claims against the RandW Insurance
Policy. 

(d) Satisfaction from Escrow. In all instances in which Sellers have any
obligation or liability to a Buyer Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) at any
time during the Indemnity Escrow Period that there that there is any amount
then-remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, Buyer shall use any amount
then-remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account as recourse to satisfy any and
all such amounts owed to a Buyer Party before proceeding directly against the
applicable Party for such amounts, subject to the other limitations of this
Article 9.

(e) Additional Environmental Indemnity Matters. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The indemnity in Section 9.2(a)(7) will survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect until the date that is seven years from the Closing
Date; provided that (i) if any claim for indemnification has been made
thereunder on or prior to such date then such claim shall survive until its
final resolution (and, for clarity, all Losses accruing in respect of such
claim prior to the resolution of such claim, whenever resolved, and regardless
of the expiration of the indemnity, shall be subject to such indemnity) and
(ii) the limitations set forth in this clause (1) shall not apply in the case
of a claim involving fraud. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

The Buyer Parties shall have the full right to control the defense and
settlement of any Third Party Claim (including any claim or directive by a
Governmental Authority seeking or relating to Environmental Damages, including
any remediation or action of any type regarding Known Environmental
Conditions) subject to indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(7), and assumption
by the Buyer Parties thereof shall not be deemed a waiver by them of their
right to indemnification hereunder. However, the Buyer Parties will observe
all of the obligations and Sellers will have all of the rights under the first
and third sentences of Section 9.4(a) and under Section 9.4(b) (but for
clarity not the other sentences of Section 9.4), subject in each case to
Section 9.4(c), with respect to any such Third Party Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

For purposes of this Section 9.2: 

"Environmental Damages" means any investigation, delineation, sampling,
testing, cleanup, monitoring, reporting, or mitigation of, or any Losses
arising from or relating to, Known Environmental Conditions, including potable
well replacement and vapor mitigation, and including fines and penalties
assessed for failure to report the presence of Known Environmental Conditions
at the Facility (to the extent such fines and penalties are predicated on pre-
Closing obligations or requirements), and including attorneys', engineering,
and consultants' fees and expenses, and fees and other amounts assessed by any
Governmental Authority, or any other action or activity of any kind related to
Known Environmental Conditions, including any contamination of surface or
groundwater, potable water, sediment, soil, indoor or outdoor air or any other
media, and any nuisance, trespass, vapor intrusion, damage or alleged damage
to any real property, personal property or natural resource or harm or alleged
harm to human health or safety, or any other condition relating to the
Release, use, treatment, storage, introduction, handling, processing,
transportation or transfer of Known Environmental Conditions at, on, in,
under, from or to the Facility regardless of (i) whether or not such Release
was caused by Sellers or their predecessors or any other Person (except to the
extent of any actual recovery of Environmental Damages by a Buyer Party from
any such predecessor or other Person), (ii) whether or not at the time the
facts and circumstances resulting in the contamination or Release occurred
were a violation of or created liability under any Environmental and Safety
Requirements and (iii) when, prior to the Closing Date, such Release occurred
(but, for clarity, including the post-Closing migration or degradation of
Known Environmental Conditions that existed at, on, in, under or about the
Facility as of or prior to the Closing Date).

"Facility" means that Real Property located at 1715 North 8th Street,
Neodesha, Kansas.

"Known Environmental Conditions" means the Release or existence of Total
Petroleum Hydrocarbon (defined as any mixture of hydrocarbons that are
originally found in or derived from crude oil) in soil, soil vapor, ambient
air or groundwater at the Facility as of or prior to the Closing Date. 

(f) Additional Real Property Indemnity Matters. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The indemnity in Section 9.2(a)(8) will survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect until the date that is 15 years from the Closing Date;
provided that (i) if any claim for indemnification has been made thereunder on
or prior to such date, then such claim shall survive until its final
resolution (and, for clarity, all Losses accruing in respect of such claim
prior to the resolution of such claim, whenever resolved, and regardless of
the expiration of the indemnity, shall be subject to such indemnity) and (ii)
the limitations set forth in this clause (1) shall not apply in the case of a
claim involving fraud. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

The Buyer Parties shall have the full right to control the defense and
settlement of any Third Party Claim (including any claim or directive by a
Governmental Authority) subject to indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(8),
and assumption by the Buyer Parties thereof shall not be deemed a waiver by
them of their right to indemnification hereunder. However, the Buyer Parties
will observe all of the obligations and Sellers will have all of the rights
under the first and third sentences of Section 9.4(a) and under Section 9.4(b)
(but for clarity not the other sentences of Section 9.4), subject in each case
to Section 9.4(c), with respect to any such Third Party Claim. 

9.3 Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing, Buyer will indemnify
Sellers, the Restricted Parties, and their Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors,
and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Parties") from and against
and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Seller Parties in respect of any Loss
which any Seller Party may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as a result
of, in connection with, relating or incidental to, or by virtue of:

(a) the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in this Agreement or any Schedule hereto or certificate delivered
hereunder; or

(b) the breach, non-compliance or non-performance of any covenant or agreement
of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of Buyer to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.2(f) will be subject to the
following limitation (provided that the following limitations shall not apply
to any claim involving fraud): (i) with respect to claims for indemnification
by Seller Parties under Section 9.3(a) (other than in respect of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 5.2 and Section 5.4),
Buyer will have no obligation to provide indemnification unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses by the Seller Parties under Section 9.3(a) (other
than in respect of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.2
and Section 5.4) exceeds the Threshold, and then only for Losses in excess of
the Threshold; and (ii) Buyer's total liability pursuant to Section 9.3(a)
will not exceed in the aggregate the final Purchase Price. The amount of
Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Section 9.2(f) will be
offset by amounts that are reimbursable by and actually recovered by the
Seller Parties from insurance (net of any deductible or co-payment and all out
of pocket costs related to such recovery) and any Tax benefits actually
realized by the Indemnified Party by reason of such Losses in the year in
which the corresponding indemnity payment is made or any prior year. After the
Closing, except for a Party's right to specific performance or injunctive
relief or for claims involving fraud, the indemnity provisions contained in
this Section 9.2(f) will be the Restricted Parties' sole and exclusive remedy
for any claim relating to breaches of 

this Agreement, other than claims pursuant to Section 1.5 and other than
claims against Buyer in respect of Buyer's post-Closing covenants in Section 6
or Section 10 of this Agreement.

9.4 Third-Party Claims.

(a) Procedures. If any demands or claims are asserted against a Person
entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2 or Section 9.2(f) (an
"Indemnified Party") or any actions, suits, or proceedings are commenced
against an Indemnified Party by a Person not a Party or an Affiliate of a
Party for which a Party (the "Indemnifying Party") is obligated to indemnify
such Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party will
give prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party in order to permit Indemnifying
Party the necessary time to evaluate the merits of such Third Party Claim, but
the failure of an Indemnified Party to give prompt notice to the Indemnifying
Party shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party to indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent any such failure materially prejudices the
rights of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right,
but not the obligation, to assume the defense of any such claim at its own
expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long
as the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification hereunder in respect of the Losses subject to
such Third Party Claim and so long as the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing that it is assuming the defense of such claim
within 20 days after receipt of notice of the claim from Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be informed and consulted with
respect to the negotiation, settlement or defense of such Third Party Claim
and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, but the fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and (i) the Indemnified
Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party may have a conflict of interest or different defenses available with
respect to such Proceeding that would make it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both parties or (ii) the Indemnifying Party has not in
fact employed counsel to assume control of such defense, the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party (limited to one law firm in
each applicable jurisdiction) shall be paid for by the Indemnifying Party. The
party controlling such defense shall keep the other party advised of the
status of such Proceeding and the defense thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Buyer as Indemnified Party shall have the full right to
control the defense and settlement of any Third Party Claim if: (1) the claim
seeks anything other than monetary damages, including an injunction or other
equitable relief; (2) the claim involves a claim by any Governmental Authority
or a significant customer, supplier, dealer, distributor, sales representative
or other business partner of the Cobalt Companies, or involves a criminal
claim; (3) the amount reasonably necessary to conclude the defense of such
Third Party Claim is in excess of (or reasonably likely to exceed) the
remaining portion of the liability cap under Section 9.2(b) applicable to such
claim after reduction of all Losses previously recovered by (or then being
claimed pursuant to unresolved claims) by the Buyer Parties that count (or
would count) towards such cap (if a cap is applicable to such claim); or (4)
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense but fails to promptly defend the
Third Party Claim. Assumption by Buyer of control of any such defense or
settlement shall not be deemed a waiver by it of its right to indemnification
hereunder. 

(b) Settlement and Compromise. An Indemnified Party may not settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). An
Indemnifying Party may not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without
the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) RandW Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the provisions hereof dealing with Third Party Claims shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of the RandW Insurance Policy.

9.5 Objections to Claims for Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification Objection. An Indemnifying Party may make a written
objection ("Indemnification Objection") to any claim for indemnification by an
Indemnified Party. The applicable Party will deliver any Indemnification
Objection to the other Party within 20 days after written notice is given to
such Party stating that the Indemnified Party has incurred Losses.

(b) Resolution by the Parties. Any Indemnification Objection will be resolved
pursuant to Section 12.8.

9.6 Other Indemnification Matters.

(a) For purposes of this Article 9, in determining whether there has been any
misrepresentation or breach of, or inaccuracy in, a representation or
warranty, and in determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or
referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all material respects",
"material adverse effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded,
it being understood and agreed that for purposes of determining liability
under this Article 9, the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in
them. 

(b) The right of any Buyer Party to indemnification will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Each Seller Party, in their capacity as such, hereby agrees that it will
not make any claim for indemnification for any Losses subject to indemnity
pursuant to Section 9.2(a). Furthermore, the obligations of the applicable
Restricted Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.7 shall not be
reduced, offset, eliminated or subject to contribution by reason of any action
or inaction by any Cobalt Company prior to the Closing that contributed to any
inaccuracy or breach giving rise to such obligation, it being understood and
agreed that such Restricted Parties, and not the Cobalt Companies, shall have
the sole obligation for the indemnity obligations under Section 9.2(a).

9.7 FE II, Inc. Obligations. Each of the Pack Trust, the Jill Trust, William
Paxson St. Clair, Jr. and Mary Whitney Callan agrees to be severally (and not
jointly) liable in accordance with their relative Pro Rata FE Interest on an
irrevocable, absolute, unconditional, continuing and primary basis with FE II,
Inc. for all obligations and undertakings of every nature of FE II, Inc. under
or arising from this Agreement (including under Section 1.5, Article 4 and
this Article 9), it being understood that any claim or Proceeding may be
brought against any such Person regardless of whether any such claim or
Proceeding is brought against any other Person and that each such Person
waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest and all
other notices of any kind and all suretyship defenses of every nature that may
otherwise be available, except for defenses available to FE II, Inc. under
this Agreement (other than any such defenses arising as a result of the
bankruptcy or insolvency of FE II, Inc.).

10. Additional Agreements.

10.1 Transaction Expenses. Except as provided in Article 9 or as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, each Party will pay all expenses
incurred by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (whether consummated or not); provided that, for clarity,
Sellers shall bear the Company Transaction Costs if the Closing occurs.

10.2 Transfer and Other Taxes. Sellers will pay 50% and Buyer will pay 50%
when due, of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and
other such similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement, except that Sellers will be
responsible for all such Taxes and fees related to the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.2(c), and Buyer and Sellers will, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and other
Taxes and fees. 

10.3 Further Assurances. The Company, Sellers and the other Restricted Parties
will execute and deliver such further documents and instruments of conveyance
and transfer and take such additional action as Buyer may reasonably request
to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

10.4 Transition Assistance. Sellers and the other Restricted Parties will
cooperate in all commercially reasonable respects with Buyer to enable Buyer
and the Cobalt Companies to comply with all legal disclosure obligations in
respect of periods prior to the Closing (including, without limitation, in
connection with Tax filings, securities transactions, and the like), and will
provide such information or testimony as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
and the Cobalt Companies in connection with any Proceeding to the extent
related to periods prior to the Closing.

10.5 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. Sellers will prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Income Tax Returns of the Cobalt Companies or
relating to the operation of the Cobalt Companies' businesses or the ownership
of the Cobalt Companies' assets for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the "Pre-Closing Tax Returns") even if the Tax
Returns are to be filed after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns will be
prepared and filed in accordance with applicable Law and in a manner
consistent with past practices. In connection therewith, the Company and each
other Cobalt Company that is taxable as a partnership will make (or have in
effect) a valid election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code for
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date. Sellers will furnish such
Income Tax Returns to Buyer for its review and comment (any such comments will
be accepted by Sellers to the extent such comments are reasonable and relate
to positions that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
Buyer or its Affiliates in a taxable period or portion thereof beginning after
the Closing Date) at least 30 days before such Income Tax Returns are to be
filed (taking into account any valid extensions to file such Tax Returns).
Sellers will pay any entity level Taxes due with respect to such Income Tax
Returns in excess of the amount thereof that was taken into account in
determining final Closing Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, any
income or loss allocated to the Company from Condesa Aviation, LLC will be
allocated to the taxable period of the Company ending on the Closing Date.

(b) Other Tax Returns. Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all other Tax Returns of the Cobalt Companies or relating to
the operation of the Cobalt Companies' businesses or the ownership of the
Cobalt Companies' assets for all periods ending after the Closing Date, other
than the Pre-Closing Tax Returns prepared by Sellers pursuant to Section
10.5(a), and including without limitation Tax Returns with respect to and any
Straddle Period. Such Tax Returns will be prepared and filed in accordance
with past practices except as otherwise required by applicable Law. The
Company will furnish such Tax Returns to Sellers for their review and comment
(any such comments will be accepted by the Company to the extent such comments
are reasonable and relate to positions that could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Sellers or that are not adequately supported by the
relevant facts or applicable Tax Law) at least 30 days (in the case of Income
Tax Returns) or 15 days (in the case of all other Tax Returns) before such Tax
Returns are to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions to file such
Tax Returns). 

(c) Disputes, Filings. Buyer and Sellers will endeavor in good faith to
resolve any differences with respect to any Tax Returns filed pursuant to
Section 10.5(a) or (b). Any unresolved disputes will be resolved by the
Arbitrator in accordance with the terms and procedures in Section 1.5(c);
provided, however, that in the event that the Arbitrator has not yet resolved
any such Tax dispute prior to the deadline for filing of the Pre-Closing Tax
Return or Straddle Period Tax Return (including any applicable extensions),
the preparing Party shall be entitled to file such Tax Return (or amendment)
as prepared as adjusted to incorporate the other Party's reasonable written
comments subject to later amendment of such Tax Return to reflect the
resolution when rendered by the Arbitrator. Sellers shall pay all unpaid Taxes
finally shown to be due on any Tax Return described in Section 10.5(b) that
pertains to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such Taxes have
been taken into account in determining final Closing Working Capital.

(d) Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of a
Straddle Period, Taxes of a Cobalt Company shall be allocated to the portion
of the period ending on Closing Date as follows: (i) all Income Taxes, sales
Taxes, employment Taxes and other Taxes that are readily apportionable based
on an actual or deemed closing of the books shall be allocated based on the
amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date and
(ii) all property and other Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and not
described in clause (i) shall be allocated based on the amount of such Tax for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of a period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

(e) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refund of a Cobalt Company that relates to Taxes paid
prior to the Closing Date for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or that are taken
into account in determining final Closing Working Capital that are actually
received by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax
Refund") shall be for the account of Sellers, except (i) to the extent any
such refund was taken into account in determining final Closing Working
Capital or (ii) for refunds arising from the carryback of a loss arising after
the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall pay to Sellers the
amount of any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund (less any Taxes imposed on the
receipt thereof and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such
amounts) within 10 business days after receipt of any such Pre-Closing Tax
Refund. 

(f) Further Tax Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers
will each:

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the
other Party in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return (including
amended returns and claims for refund), or the conduct of any audit or other
examination by any Governmental Authority or Proceedings relating to liability
of the Cobalt Companies for Taxes; 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

retain and provide the other with any record or other information that
reasonably may be relevant to such Tax Return; 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

provide the other with adequate information, including but not limited to any
final determination of any such audit or examination, Proceeding or
determination that reasonably may be expected to affect any amount required to
be shown on any Tax Return of the other Party for any period; and 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

none of Sellers, Buyer, the Cobalt Companies or any of their Affiliates shall
dispose of any Tax Returns, Tax schedules, material Tax work-papers or any
material books or records with respect to the Cobalt Companies relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period unless it first offers in writing to
the party the right to take possession of such materials at such other party's
sole expense and the other party fails to accept such offer within fifteen
(15) calendar days of the offer being made. Any information obtained under
this Section 10.5(f) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims with respect
to any Tax. 

(g) Tax Treatment of Transaction. For federal Income Tax purposes, the sale of
the Units pursuant to this Agreement will be treated, pursuant to Revenue
Ruling 99-6, (i) by the Buyer, as a purchase of Company assets and, (ii) by
Sellers, as a sale of Units. Except as required by Law, Buyers and Sellers
will not take any Tax position contrary to this treatment on any Tax Return,
internal accounting record, external report, or any other document in which
the Tax treatment of these transactions may be disclosed

(h) Purchase Price Allocation. Sellers and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price
shall be allocated among the Company's assets (or group of assets) in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and the
purchase price allocation methodology set forth on Schedule 10.5(h) (the
"Purchase Price Allocation"). A draft of the Purchase Price Allocation
("Purchase Price Allocation Schedule") shall be prepared by Sellers and
delivered to Buyer within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date. If Buyer
notifies Seller in writing that Buyer objects to one or more items reflected
in the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if Sellers and
Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, such
dispute shall be considered a Disputed Item to be resolved by the Arbitrator.
Sellers and Buyer each agree to report, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to report, the federal, state, and local income and other Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated herein, and in particular to
report the information required by Section 1060(b) of the Tax Code and to
jointly prepare Form 8594 (the Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060
of the Tax Code) as promptly as possible following the Closing Date in a
manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as may be
revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the Purchase 

Price, including any adjustments pursuant to the Agreement to determine the
Purchase Price. Unless there has been a Final Determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code) to the contrary, Sellers and Buyer, severally and

(b) Change of Notice Address. Any Party may change the address or electronic
mail address by giving the other Party notice in the manner set forth in
Section 12.6(a).

12.7 Governing Law. Except as provided in Section 12.12, this Agreement will
be governed by and construed it accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

12.8 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Arbitration. Except as provided in Section 1.5 and Section 12.12, any
dispute or claim among any Parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including its negotiation, enforcement, validity or interpretation
or an alleged breach, default or misrepresentation hereunder and the
determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate
(each, a "Dispute") shall be finally resolved by arbitration in accordance
with this Section. Such arbitration will be held in St. Louis, Missouri and
will be conducted before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"). Within
15 days after a Party's delivery to the other Party of a demand for
arbitration, the Parties will attempt to select the arbitrator by agreement,
and if 

successful, the arbitrator will administer the proceeding without the
involvement of the AAA. If the Parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator,
the Party asserting the claim must file a demand for arbitration with the AAA,
the arbitrator will be selected under the AAA process, and the AAA will
administer the arbitration. The arbitrator will rule in accordance with
applicable legal standards upon motions to compel or limit discovery and will
have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and costs,
to the same extent as a court of law or equity, should the arbitrator
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator will be written, will be in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule and this Agreement, will be binding and conclusive,
and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
any Party refuses to perform any or all of its obligations under the final
arbitration award (following appeal, if applicable) within 15 days of such
award being rendered, then any other Party may enforce the final award in any
court of competent jurisdiction. The Party seeking enforcement of the
arbitration award shall be entitled to recover from the other Party all costs,
fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in obtaining
and enforcing a judgment on the award. The Parties shall maintain the
confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, including the
arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary (i) to prepare for or conduct
the arbitration hearing on the merits, (ii) in connection with a court
application for a preliminary remedy or to confirm or challenge an award or
its enforcement, or (iii) as required by applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12.8(a) or Section
12.8(b), the Parties further agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, could occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, without the need to post any bond
or other security, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the
Parties are entitled under this Agreement and (ii) the right of specific
enforcement in favor of the Parties is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties
would have entered into this Agreement. 

(c) Any Dispute or portion thereof that may not be arbitrated pursuant to
applicable state or federal law may be heard only in a court of competent
jurisdiction.

12.9 Amendments and Waivers. Except as provided in Section 12.12, no amendment
of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless it is in writing and
signed by Buyer and Sellers. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement,
whether intentional or not, will apply to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement or
affect in any other way any rights arising by virtue of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant under this Agreement.

12.10 Legal Representations.

(a) Each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of
their successors and assigns (all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that
following the Closing, Foulston Siefkin LLP may serve as counsel to any
directors or officers of a Cobalt Company or any Unitholders, other Restricted
Parties, or their Affiliates in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, notwithstanding
representation of the Cobalt Companies before the Closing Date. Each of the
Parties hereby does, and will cause each of the Waiving Parties to, expressly
consent to the foregoing arrangements, and irrevocably waives (and will not
assert) any actual or potential conflict of interest or any objection that may
arise from any representation by Foulston Siefkin LLP expressly permitted by
this Section. The Waiving Parties acknowledge that the foregoing provision
applies whether or not Foulston Siefkin LLP provides legal services to the
Cobalt Companies after the Closing Date.

(b) Each of the Waiving Parties hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that all communications and attorney work-product documentation between the
Cobalt Companies, on the one hand, and their counsel, on the other hand, made
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of,
and performance under, this Agreement by the Cobalt Companies (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto), to the extent they are privileged
communications and documentation between the Cobalt Companies and such
counsel, the ownership of such privilege will not pass to Buyer following the
Closing Date.

12.11 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, exhibits, or schedules, such reference will be to an Article or
Section of or exhibit or schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are

thereunder and any references to any agreement, document or instrument means
such agreement, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect

context otherwise requires (a) "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily
exclusive, (b) words in the singular include the plural and vice versa, (c)
the use in this Agreement of a pronoun in reference to a party hereto includes
the masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require, (d) terms used

(e) currency amounts referenced herein are in U.S. Dollars. With respect to 

any determination of any period of time, "from" means "from and including" and

business" of any Person means the ordinary course of business of such Person
consistent with past practice unless otherwise specified. References in

the online data room hosted by Foulston Siefkin LLP at foulston.firmex.com on
behalf of the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at least three business days prior to the date hereof. No provision
of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of, or against, any of the
Parties to this Agreement by reason of the extent to which any such Party or
its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by reason of the extent to
which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof, and no
rule of strict construction will be applied against any Party hereto. The
Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and exhibits hereto, will
be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this
Agreement.

contained in this Agreement, each of the Parties: (a) agrees that it will not
bring or support any Person, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or
support any Person, in any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit

performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
