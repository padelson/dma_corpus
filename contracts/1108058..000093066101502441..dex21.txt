cash balance and cash equivalents as of the Closing Date and any amount of cash
spent on capital expenditures (as defined by GAAP) subsequent to the date hereof
but prior to the Closing Date less the Deducted Liabilities (the "Cash
                              ----
Consideration Amount"). "Deducted Liabilities" shall mean (i) liabilities (other
than the long term portion of the liabilities of the Acquired Entities under
leases which are treated as capital leases under GAAP as of the Closing Date)
required by GAAP to be reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Acquired Entities on the Closing Date, (ii) the outstanding balance of all
Advances under the Loan Agreement as of the Closing Date (without duplication of
liabilities provided for in clause (i) above), as of the Closing Date and (iii)
all customer deposits, prepaid sales and similar items, including specifically,
those related to that certain customer deposit of $1.5 million from Memcorp Inc.
to the Company and similar arrangements (without duplication of liabilities
provided for in clause (i) above). "Parent Adjusted Capital" shall be the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
Closing (the "Gross Shares") less any shares of Parent Common Stock (the
"Adjustment Shares") issued by Parent subsequent to September 30, 2001 in
connection with any merger, consolidation, business combination, investment or
other similar transaction pursuant to which Parent acquires (x) 50% or more of
the voting power of any Entity or (y) all or

                                       3.
<PAGE>

substantially all of the assets of any Entity or the issuance of Parent Common
Stock to raise capital; provided, however, that the maximum number of Adjustment
Shares that may be subtracted from the number of Gross Shares shall not exceed
7.5% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding on the date of
this Agreement. The Total Merger Consideration shall be allocated to the
Shareholders as described in subsections (i) through (iv) below. For the
purposes of calculating the value of the Total Merger Shares pursuant to this
Section 1.5(b), shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at $15.82 per
share.

               (i)       Each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at
Closing shall be entitled to receive $0.50 per share (the "Series A Preference")
payable in cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock, as determined below; and
each share of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing shall be entitled
to receive $1.6026 per share (the "Series B Preference") payable in cash and/or
shares of Parent Common Stock, as determined below; provided, however, if the
value of the Total Merger Consideration is less than the sum of (A) the
Aggregate Series A Preference plus (B) the Aggregate Series B Preference, then
(x) each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing shall be
entitled to receive that amount equal to (i)(A) the Aggregate Series A
Preference divided by (B) the sum of the Aggregate Series A Preference plus the
Aggregate Series B Preference, multiplied by (ii)(A) the Total Merger
Consideration divided by (B) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding at Closing and (y) each share of Series B Preferred Stock
outstanding at Closing shall be entitled to receive that amount equal to (i)(A)
the Aggregate Series B Preference divided by (B) the sum of the Aggregate Series
B Preference plus the Aggregate Series A Preference, multiplied by (ii)(A) the
Total Merger Consideration divided by (B) the number of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing.

               (ii)      If the value of the Total Merger Consideration exceeds
the sum of the Aggregate Series A Preference and the Aggregate Series B
Preference, then, after making the allocations set forth in Section 1.5(b)(i),
each share of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Company
Common Stock outstanding at Closing shall be entitled to $1.50 per share payable
in cash and/or stock, as determined below; provided, however, that if (x) the
product of $1.50 multiplied by the number of Company Common Stock Equivalents
outstanding at Closing (such product, the "Full A Participation Amount"),
exceeds (y)(i) the value of the Total Merger Consideration less (ii) the sum of
(A) the Aggregate Series A Preference plus (B) the Aggregate Series B Preference
(such difference, the "Primary Participation Pool"), then each share of Series A
Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock outstanding
at Closing shall be entitled to an amount equal to (A) the Primary Participation
Pool divided by (B) the number of Company Common Stock Equivalents outstanding
at Closing.

               (iii)     If the value of the Primary Participation Pool exceeds
the Full A Participation Amount, then, after making the allocations set forth in
Sections 1.5(b)(i) or (ii), each share of Series B Preferred Stock and Company
Common Stock outstanding at Closing shall be entitled to receive $3.3078 per
share payable in cash and/or stock, as determined below; provided, however, that
if (x) the product of $3.3078 multiplied by the number of Company Common Stock
Equivalents (other than shares of Series A Preferred Stock) outstanding at
Closing (such product, the "Full B Participation Amount"), exceeds (y)(i) the
value of the Total Merger Consideration less (ii) the sum of (A) the Aggregate
Series A Preference plus (B) the

                                       4.
<PAGE>

Aggregate Series B Preference plus (C) the Full A Participation Amount (such
difference, the "Secondary Participation Pool"), then each share of Series B
Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock outstanding at Closing shall be
entitled to an amount equal to the Secondary Participation Pool divided by the
number of Company Common Stock Equivalents (other than shares of Series A
Preferred Stock) outstanding at Closing.

               (iv)      If the value of the Secondary Participation Pool
exceeds the Full B Participation Amount, then, after making the allocations set
forth in Sections 1.5(b)(i), (ii) and (iii), each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding at Closing shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the
quotient of (A) the difference between (i) the Secondary Participation Pool
minus (ii) the Full B Participation Amount, divided by (B) the sum of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock plus (ii) Company Options outstanding
at Closing.

               (v)       Each share of the common stock of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

               (vi)      All Excluded Shares shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered or be deliverable
therefor.

          (c)  For purposes of this Agreement:

               (i)       The cash consideration, if any, shall be paid only in
respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and
Company Common Stock outstanding at Closing. The amount of cash payable in
respect of each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing shall
be equal to (A) the product of (x) the Series A Fraction multiplied by (y) the
Cash Consideration Amount, divided by (B) the number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing. The amount of cash payable in respect of
each share of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing shall be equal to
(A) the product of (x) the Series B Fraction multiplied by (y) the Cash
Consideration Amount, divided by (B) the number of shares of Series B Preferred
Stock outstanding at Closing. The amount of cash payable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding at Closing shall be equal to (A) the
product of (x) the Common Stock Fraction multiplied by (y) the Cash
Consideration Amount, divided by (B) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding at Closing. The remaining amounts payable in respect of the
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), as applicable, shall be
paid in shares of Parent Common Stock, with such shares of Parent Common Stock
valued at $15.82 per share; it being understood that certain of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1.5 shall be held in
escrow in accordance with Section 1.10.

               (ii)      The "Aggregate Series A Preference" shall be equal to
the product of (A) the Series A Preference multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing.

                                       5.
<PAGE>

               (iii)     The "Aggregate Series B Preference" shall be equal to
the product of (A) the Series B Preference multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing.

               (iv)      The "Series A Fraction" shall be the fraction: (A)
having a numerator equal to the Series A Allocation and (B) having a denominator
equal to the sum of the Series A Allocation, the Series B Allocation and the
Common Stock Allocation.

               (v)       The "Series B Fraction" shall be the fraction: (A)
having a numerator equal to the Series B Allocation and (B) having a denominator
equal to the sum of the Series A Allocation, the Series B Allocation and the
Common Stock Allocation.

               (vi)      The "Common Stock Fraction" shall be the fraction: (A)
having a numerator equal to the Common Stock Allocation and (B) having a
denominator equal to the sum of the Series A Allocation, the Series B Allocation
and the Common Stock Allocation.

               (vii)     The "Series A Allocation" shall be equal to (A) the
aggregate amounts payable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to
Sections 1.5(b)(i) and (ii), multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing.

               (viii)    The "Series B Allocation" shall be equal to (A) the
aggregate amounts payable to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to
Sections 1.5(b)(i), (ii) and (iii), multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at Closing.

               (ix)      The "Common Stock Allocation" shall be equal to (A) the
aggregate amounts payable to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
Sections 1.5(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv), multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding at Closing.

               (x)       The "Company Common Stock Equivalents" shall consist of
(A) the shares of Outstanding Company Capital Stock (including any such shares
that are subject to a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture under any
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement, but excluding any
Excluded Shares), (B) the Company Options outstanding at Closing, and (C) the
warrants, options (other than Company Options), convertible securities and any
other rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at Closing.

               (xi)      The "Merger Consideration" receivable by a holder of
capital stock of the Company shall consist of (i) the shares of Parent Common
Stock (other than Escrow Shares (as defined in Section 1.10)) issuable to such
holder in accordance with Section 1.5 upon the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing capital stock of the Company held by such holder, (ii)
the rights of such holder with respect to the Escrow Shares held by the Escrow
Agent on behalf of such holder, (iii) the right of such holder to receive a
portion of the Cash Consideration Amount in accordance with Section 1.5, and
(iv) the right of such holder to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.8(a).

                                       6.
<PAGE>

          (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder shall not exceed the
Total Merger Shares and the maximum aggregate amount of cash payable hereunder,
if any, shall not exceed the Cash Consideration Amount, if any.

          (e)  If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock
will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock shall accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement.

     1.6  Employee Stock Options.

          (a)  At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Option and
Company Warrant and each other outstanding option to purchase Company Common
Stock issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) of such Company Stock Option Plan under which
such Company Option was issued and the stock option agreement by which such
Company Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock
under outstanding Company Options and with respect to any Company capital stock
under outstanding Company Warrants shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time,
(i) each Company Option and Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be exercised
solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Option and Company Warrant
shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject
to such Company Option and the number of shares of Company capital stock that
were subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Company Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (iii) the per
share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each
such assumed Company Option or Company Warrant shall be determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock or Company capital stock,
as applicable, subject to such Company Option or Company Warrant, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by such Company Option Exchange Ratio,
and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent, and all
restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Option or Company
Warrant shall continue in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability,
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option or Company Warrant
shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each such assumed
Company Option or Company Warrant shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction
effected by Parent after the Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties

                                       7.
<PAGE>

that the Company Options so assumed by Parent following the Effective Time will
remain incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the
extent such options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time. The Company and Parent shall take all action that may be necessary (under
the Company Stock Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 1.6. "Company Option Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (1) the total dollar value allocable to one share of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 1.5(b), by (2) $15.82.

          (b)  Prior to and at the Effective Time, there shall be no
acceleration of vesting of any Company Options or Company Warrants assumed by
Parent solely as a result of the Merger except pursuant to pre-existing written
agreements which have been provided to Parent prior to Closing.

          (c)  Holders of Company Options and Company Warrants that are assumed
by Parent shall not be entitled to their pro rata portion of the Total Merger
Shares until such securities are exercised by the holders thereof.

     1.7  Closing of the Company's Transfer Books.  At the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing shares of capital stock of the Company that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of capital stock of the Company shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any shares of capital stock of the Company
(a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged
as provided in Section 1.8.

     1.8  Exchange of Certificates.

          (a)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will send
to each of the Shareholders a letter of transmittal in customary form and
containing such customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to Parent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by
Parent by any such Shareholder, Parent shall (i) deliver to each such
Shareholder a certificate representing the balance of such Shareholder's Pro
Rata Portion of Parent Common Stock that such Shareholder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.5 minus such Shareholder's Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Shares, and (ii) deliver to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement
(as defined below) a certificate in the name of the Escrow Agent for the Escrow
Shares. The "Escrow Shares" shall mean the shares of Parent Common Stock
originally placed in escrow as determined by the following formula:

                X   =    ((Y + (W x Z)) x .15)
                         ---------------------
                                  Z

                                       8.
<PAGE>

Where   X      =    the Escrow Shares;
        Y      =    the Cash Consideration;
        Z      =    Closing Sales Price (as defined below)
        W      =    Total Merger Shares

     The certificates representing Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the
holder of a Company Stock Certificate under clause (i) above and to the Escrow
Agent under clause (ii) above shall, in each case, represent only whole shares
of Parent Common Stock.  In lieu of any fractional shares to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled, after combining any fractional interests of such
holder into as many whole shares as is possible, the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate shall be paid in cash an amount equal to the sum of (1) the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the
Closing Sales Price (as defined below) by the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to such holder under clause (i)
above and (2) the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined
by multiplying the Closing Sales Price by the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to the Escrow Agent under
clause (ii) above.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may deliver to the
Escrow Agent one certificate representing the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be held in escrow pursuant to this Section 1.8(a) in lieu of
issuing separate certificates representing each such holder's Escrow Shares.  As
used in this Agreement, the "Closing Sales Price" shall mean the closing sales
price of one share of Parent Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq on the Closing
Date and if such date is not a trading day, then the last trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.  All Company Stock Certificates so
surrendered shall be canceled.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.8, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the portion of the Total
Merger Consideration due upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
this Agreement.  If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock or the payment of
cash in lieu of fractional shares, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit, surety
bond and indemnity with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

          (b)  No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of any fractional share shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder
surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8
(at which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends and
distributions and such cash payment).

          (c)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any
holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to
deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law, provided that Parent or the Surviving Corporation pays
to the applicable government authority in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements,

                                       9.
<PAGE>

the amount so withheld. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

          (d)  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for
any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.9  Dissenters' Rights.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of capital stock of the Company held by a holder who, pursuant
to Chapter 13 of the CGCL or any successor provision, has the right to dissent
to the Merger and demand payment for such shares and properly dissents and
demands payment for the fair value of such shares of capital stock of the
Company ("Dissenting Shares") in accordance with the CGCL, shall not be
converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section
1.5, unless such holder withdraws, fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holder's right to such payment, if any.  If, after the Effective Time, such
holder withdraws, fails to perfect or loses any such right to payment, such
holder's Dissenting Shares shall be treated as having been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Total Merger
Consideration provided for in Section 1.5.  At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights provided in Chapter 13 of the CGCL or any successor provision and as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence.  The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of capital stock of the Company and the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand.  Except to the
extent otherwise required by the CGCL, the Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer.

     1.10  Escrow of Parent Common Stock.  Upon the Closing, Parent shall
withhold the Escrow Shares to be delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to
Section 1.8(a)(ii) (the "Escrow Shares") and deliver such shares to Wells Fargo
Bank Texas, N.A. as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), to be held by the Escrow
Agent as collateral to secure the rights of the Indemnitees under Section 10
hereof. The Escrow Shares shall be held pursuant to the provisions of an escrow
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E (the "Escrow Agreement"). The
deposit of the Escrow Shares with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement shall constitute full and final payment of that consideration
to the appropriate Shareholders in consideration of such Shareholders'
respective shares of Company capital stock pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Escrow Agent to release shares
to the Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 hereof and
the Escrow Agreement and shall be obligated to cause the Parent's transfer agent
to certificate such shares as released in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Shares will be represented by a certificate or
certificates issued in the name of the Escrow Agent and will be held by the
Escrow Agent for periods as set forth in the Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow
Period"). In the event that this Agreement is adopted by the Shareholders'
Representative, as evidenced solely by the execution and delivery of this

                                      10.
<PAGE>

Agreement and the Escrow Agreement by the Shareholders' Representative, then all
of the Shareholders shall, without any further act of any Shareholder, be deemed
to have consented to and approved (i) the use of the Escrow Shares as collateral
to secure the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 11 in the
manner set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) the appointment of
the Shareholders' Representative as the representative under the Escrow
Agreement of the Persons receiving merger consideration under this Agreement and
as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each such Person (other
than holders of Dissenting Shares).

     1.11  Tax Consequences.  For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code.  The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations.

     2.5  Financial Statements.

          (a)  The Company has delivered to Parent the following financial
statements and notes (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements"):

               (i)       The consolidated audited balance sheets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, and
the related audited income statements, statements of shareholders' equity and
statements of cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the
periods then ended together with the notes thereto and the unqualified reports
and opinions of Arthur Andersen LLP relating thereto; and

               (ii)      The consolidated and consolidating unaudited balance
sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001 (the
"Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet"), and the related income statement, statement
of shareholders equity and statements of cash flow of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for the period then ended.

          (b)  The Company Financial Statements present fairly the financial
position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof and the results of operations (and, in the case of the financial
statements referred to in Section 2.5(a)(i), cash flows of each of the Acquired
Entities) for the periods covered thereby. The Company Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods covered except that the financial statements referred to in Section
2.5(a)(ii) do not contain footnotes.

     2.6  Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.  None of the Acquired Entities
have any liabilities of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable whether or not required to be reflected in
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and whether due or to become due
("Liabilities"), other than (i) Liabilities reflected or provided for on the
Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet, (ii) Liabilities contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) normal or recurring Liabilities incurred since the Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and
(iv) obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to
Contracts to which the Company and any Company Subsidiaries are party and which
are entered into consistent with past practices and in the ordinary course of
business and any of which individually exceeds $50,000 in value is listed in
Part 2.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Any Liabilities of the type
described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence in excess of $50,000,
individually, are listed and described in Part 2.6 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

     2.7  Accounts Receivable.  The accounts receivable shown on the Unaudited
Interim Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business and have been
collected or are collectible in the book amounts thereof, less an amount not in
excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns provided for in the
Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet.  The accounts receivable of the Acquired
Entities arising after the Balance Sheet Date and prior to the Closing Date
arose, or will arise, in the ordinary course of business and have been collected
or will be collectible in the book amounts thereof, less allowances for doubtful
accounts and returns determined in accordance with GAAP and the past practices
of Company.  As of the Other Termination Date,

                                      15.
<PAGE>

any accounts receivable shown on the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet outstanding
as of the Other Termination Date not yet collected shall be deemed uncollectible
and, if in excess of the allowance therefor in the financial statements of
Company as of the Balance Sheet Date, the amount of the uncollected accounts
reflected on the books of the Company at the Closing less the amount of the
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable reflected in the Closing Balance
Sheet shall be deducted from the Escrowed Shares released on that date (with
these shares being valued as described in the Escrow Agreement). None of such
accounts receivable is subject to any claim of offset or recoupment or
counterclaim, and neither Company nor any Acquired Entity has any knowledge of
any specific facts that would be likely to give rise to any such claim. No
amount of such accounts receivable is contingent upon the performance by Company
or any other Acquired Entity of any obligation and no agreement for deduction or
discount has been made with respect to any such accounts receivable.

     2.8  Inventories    The inventories shown on the Unaudited Interim Balance
Sheet or thereafter acquired by Company and the Company Subsidiaries consist of
items of a quantity and quality usable or salable in the ordinary course of
business. Since the Balance Sheet Date, Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have continued to replenish inventories in a normal and customary manner
consistent with past practices. Neither Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries have received notice that it will experience in the foreseeable
future any difficulty in obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and at a
reasonable price and upon reasonable terms and conditions, the supplies or
component products required for the manufacture, assembly or production of its
products. The value at which inventories are carried reflect the inventory
valuation policies of Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which is consistent
with its past practice and in accordance with GAAP. Due provision has been made
on the books of Company and the Company Subsidiaries, consistent with past
practices, to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories at
their estimated useful or scrap values, and such inventory reserves are adequate
to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory and inventory
shrinkage.

     2.9  Absence of Changes    Since the Balance Sheet Date, each Acquired
Entity has conducted its business in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practices and, since such date, none of the Acquired
Entities has:

aggregate) that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company

right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
retirement, health, vacation or other employee benefit plan at any time, and (b)

defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act.

     6.11  Restrictions on Transfer of Parent Common Stock Issued in the

such Purchaser Representative shall have executed and delivered documentation

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements are subject to the satisfaction or written waiver, at or prior to the
Closing, of the following conditions:

     7.1  Accuracy of Representations.  The representations and warranties of
Parent contained in this Agreement shall have been accurate in all respects as
of the date of this Agreement and shall be accurate in all respects as of the
Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except as to such
representations and warranties made as of a specific date, which shall have been
accurate in all respects as of such date), except that, in each case, any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties will be disregarded if,
after aggregating all inaccuracies of such representations and warranties as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (without duplication),
such inaccuracies and the circumstances giving rise to all such inaccuracies do
not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect determined as of the Closing
Date (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties, all "Parent Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications and other materiality qualifications, contained in such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded).

     7.2  Performance of Covenants.  All of the covenants and obligations that
Parent and Merger Sub are required to comply with or to perform at or prior to
the Closing shall have been complied with and performed in all material
respects.

                                      50.
<PAGE>

     7.3  Documents.  The Company shall have received the following documents:

          (a)  executed copies of (i) the legal opinion of CG, dated as of the
Closing Date and rendered to the Company, to the effect that the Merger will
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code (it
being understood that, in rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely upon the
tax representation letters reasonably acceptable to GCWF and CG) and (ii) the
legal opinion of GCWF as to certain other matters in the form attached in
Exhibit J hereto; the opinion referred to in clause (i) of this Section 7.3(a)
shall not be waivable unless approval of the opposing party is obtained with
appropriate disclosure and in rendering such opinions, counsel may rely upon
reasonable representations and certificates of Parent, Merger Sub and Company;

          (b)  an Escrow Agreement, executed by the Escrow Agent, the
Shareholder Representative and the Parent;

          (c)  a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent representing and warranting
that the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been duly
satisfied; and

     7.4  No Restraints.  No temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger
shall have been issued by any Governmental Body and remain in effect, and there
shall not be any Legal Requirement enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger
that makes consummation of the Merger illegal.

     7.5  No Litigation.  There shall not be pending any Legal Proceeding in
which there is a reasonable likelihood of an outcome that could have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

     7.6  Total Assets.  The total assets of the Acquired Entities for purposes
of the HSR Act and as reported on the last regularly prepared consolidated

8.   Registration of Shares.

     8.1  Registration Statement.

          (a)  As promptly as practicable after the Closing (and in any event
within twenty (20) days after the Closing), Parent shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is unavailable, on any other
appropriate form (the "Registration Statement") registering for resale the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and upon the
exercise of any Company Warrants assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6 (such
shares of Parent Common Stock being referred to collectively as the "Registrable
Shares"). Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts: (a) to cause the

                                      51.
<PAGE>

Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as
practicable after the Closing; and (b) to cause the Registration Statement to
remain effective until the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, (ii) the date all of the Registrable Shares registered thereunder may be
sold under Rule 144 in one three-month period, or (iii) the date on which all of
the Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statement have been sold.

          (b)  Parent shall (at its own expense):

               (i)       prepare and file with the SEC such amendments to the
Registration Statement, and such supplements to the related prospectus, as may
be required in order to comply with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act;

               (ii)      promptly furnish to the holders of Registrable Shares
such numbers of copies of a prospectus conforming to the requirements of the
Securities Act as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statement; and

               (iii)     use reasonable efforts to register and qualify the
Registrable Shares under the securities laws of such states as the holders of
Registrable Shares may reasonably request; provided, however, that Parent shall
not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to
do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any of such
states.

          (c)  A Person who receives Registrable Shares in the Merger pursuant
to Section 1.5 shall be referred to herein as a "Participating Holder."

          (d)  Indemnification.

               (i)       Parent agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by
law, each Participating Holder against all Damages suffered by such
Participating Holder as a result of any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in the related
prospectus or preliminary prospectus (or in any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto) or as a result of any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission results from or is contained in any information
furnished in writing to Parent by such Participating Holder for use therein or
results from such Participating Holder's failure to deliver a copy of the
Registration Statement or related prospectus (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) after Parent has furnished such Participating Holder with a
sufficient number of copies thereof.

               (ii)      In connection with the Registration Statement, each
Participating Holder (i) shall furnish to Parent in writing such information and
affidavits as Parent reasonably requests for use in connection with such
Registration Statement or the related prospectuses, and (ii) to the extent
permitted by law, will indemnify Parent, its directors and officers and each
Person who controls Parent (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all Damages resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material
fact contained in such Registration Statement or in the related prospectus or
preliminary prospectus (or in any


                                      52.
<PAGE>

amendment thereof or supplement thereto) or from any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission results from or is
contained in any information or affidavit furnished in writing by such
Participating Holder.

               (iii)     Any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Section 8 will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any
claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification, and (ii) unless in the
indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest exists between
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed,
the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any consent to
the entry of any judgment or any settlement made by the indemnified party
without the indemnifying party's consent (but such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects
not to, assume the defense of a claim will pay the fees and expenses of only one
counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to
such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a
conflict of interest exists between such indemnified party and any other
indemnified party with respect to such claim (in which case the indemnifying
party will pay the fees and expenses of additional counsel).

          (e)  Transferability of Registration Rights. The rights of
Participating Holders under this Section 8 are not transferable except in
connection with: (i) a transfer by will or intestacy; (ii) estate planning
transfers consisting of gifts to the spouse or issue of the transferor, or to a
charity qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code; and (iii) a distribution
of any of the Registrable Shares, without additional consideration, to the
underlying beneficial owners thereof (such as the general partners, limited
partners, shareholders or trust beneficiaries of a Company shareholder), in
which event in each such case such transferee or distributee shall be deemed to
be a "Participating Holder" for purposes of this Section 8 and shall be required
to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.

          (f)  Delay of Registration.  For a period not to exceed 15 days,
Parent may delay the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or suspend the
use of the Registration Statement (and the Participating Holders hereby agree
not to offer or sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration
Statement during such period) after receiving notice of such delay or
suspension), at any time when Parent, in its reasonable judgment after
consultation with counsel, believes that there is or may be in existence
material nonpublic information or events involving Parent, the failure of which
to be disclosed in the prospectus included in either of the Registration
Statement could result in a violation of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
any provision of any state securities law (the "Suspension Right"). In the event
Parent exercises the Suspension Right, such suspension shall continue for the
period of time, and only such period of time, reasonably necessary for
disclosure to occur at a time that is not detrimental to Parent or its
stockholders or until such time as the information or event is no longer
material, each as determined in good faith by Parent after consultation with
counsel. Parent will promptly give the Participating Holders notice of any such
delay or suspension and prompt notice of the cessation of suspension or delay.
In the event Parent reasonably believes that any of the foregoing


                                      53.
<PAGE>


circumstances are continuing after such 15-day period, it may, with the consent
of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) extend such 15-day period for one additional 15-day
period. Parent will use all reasonable efforts to minimize the length of any
suspension or delay under this Section 8.1(f); provided, however that nothing
contained in this Section 8.1 shall be deemed to require Parent to make any
disclosures.

          (g)  Amendment of Section 8.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 8 may be amended by
Parent at any time with the consent of the Shareholders' Representative.

9.   Termination

     9.1  Termination Events.  This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:

          (a)  by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

          (b)  by either Parent or the Company, if any Order by any Governmental
Body of competent jurisdiction preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Merger shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) must
have used all reasonable efforts to remove any such Order;

          (c)  by Parent if (i) any of the Company's representations and
warranties contained in Section 2 shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date
of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), such that the condition
set forth in Section 6.1 would not be satisfied as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate (assuming the Closing
Date were as of such time), or (ii) any of the Company's covenants contained in
Sections 4 or 5 shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in
Section 6.2 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach (assuming the
Closing Date were as of such time); provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in
any of the Company's representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to
the date of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by the Company is curable
by the Company and the Company is continuing to exercise all reasonable efforts
to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(c) on account of such inaccuracy or breach until thirty
(30) days subsequent to the date of such inaccuracy or breach;

          (d)  by the Company if (i) any of Parent's representations and
warranties contained in Section 3 shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date
of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), such that the condition
set forth in Section 7.1 would not be satisfied as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate (assuming the Closing
Date were as of such time), or (ii) if any of Parent's covenants contained in
Section 5 shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section
7.2 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach (assuming the Closing
Date were of such time); provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of
Parent's representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of
this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by Parent is curable by Parent and
Parent is continuing to exercise all reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy
or breach, then the Company may not

                                      54.
<PAGE>

terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) on account of such inaccuracy
or breach until thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of such inaccuracy or
breach; or

          (e)  by Parent or the Company if the Closing has not taken place on or
before December 15, 2001; provided, however, that such date shall be extended to
April 15, 2002 if (i) the parties are required to make filings with the U.S.
Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, pursuant to the HSR Act or (ii)
Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act is unavailable as an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and Parent elects either
(x) to register the offering of shares in the Merger on a registration statement
of Form S-4 in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act or (y) to
issue such shares as exempt securities in accordance with Section 3(a)(10) of
the Securities Act (other than as a result of any failure on the part of the
terminating party to comply with or perform any of its covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement).

     9.2  Termination Procedures.  If either party wishes to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, it shall deliver to the other party a written
notice stating that it is terminating this Agreement and (except for termination
under Section 9.1(e) which will not require such certification) setting forth a
brief description of the basis on which it is terminating this Agreement.

     9.3  Effect of Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
terminate; provided, however, that: (a) neither the Company nor Parent shall be
relieved of any obligation or liability arising from any inaccuracy or prior
breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
provision of this Agreement; (b) the parties shall, in all events, remain bound
by and continue to be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 10; (c) the
parties shall, in all events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to
Section 5.1; and (d) no party shall be liable for any consequential or punitive
damages.

10.  Indemnification

     10.1  Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants. All

Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect as follows:

          (a)  The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 2.11 (Intellectual Property) and those portions of the Company
Disclosure Schedule related to such representations and warranties shall survive
until the third anniversary of the Closing Date at which time such
representations and warranties shall expire;

          (b)  The representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 2.16 (Taxes) and those portions of the Company Disclosure Schedule
related to such representations and warranties shall survive until the second

warranties shall expire; and

                                      55.
<PAGE>

          (c)  All representations and warranties of the Company other than
those contained in Section 2.11 (Intellectual Property) and Section 2.16 (Taxes)
and those portions of the Company Disclosure Schedule related to such
representations and warranties shall survive until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date at which time such representations and warranties shall expire.

     10.2 Indemnification by the Company.

          (a)  Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 10, the
Company will indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective officers, directors, affiliates, stockholders, agents,
attorneys and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may control
Parent or the Surviving Corporation within the meaning of the Securities Act
(each being a "Parent Indemnified Person;" collectively, the "Parent Indemnified
Persons") from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and
expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of action, including,
legal fees and expenses, (collectively, "Losses") arising out of, based upon,
related to, caused by or in connection with any misrepresentation or inaccuracy,
non-performance, breach of or default in any of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements given or made by the Company in Section 2 or Section 4
of this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule. The recourse of the
Indemnified Persons shall be to make claims against the Escrow Shares and claims
against the Escrow Shares shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Indemnified
Persons for any Losses hereunder.

          (b)  Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability in amount or
otherwise of (i) the Company for any knowing misrepresentation or inaccuracy, or
non-performance, or intentional breach of or default in any representation,
warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close, or (ii) any shareholder of
the Company with respect to fraud, criminal activity or the knowing or
intentional misrepresentation, inaccuracy or non-performance, or intentional
breach of or default in any covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement.

     10.3  Indemnity Cap; Threshold for Claims; Excluded Losses and Costs.  No
claim for Losses shall be made under this Section 10 unless the aggregate of all
Losses exceeds $250,000 for which claims are made hereunder by the Parent
Indemnified Persons, in which case the Parent Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to seek compensation for all Losses in excess of such $250,000 (the
"Limitation"); provided, however, the Limitation shall not be applicable with
respect to the Excluded Losses and Costs.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the total Losses recoverable from the Escrow Shares by all
Parent Indemnified Persons collectively shall not exceed in the aggregate an
amount equal to the product of the total number of Escrow Shares times the
Closing Sales Price (the "Indemnity Cap"); provided, however, the Indemnity Cap
shall not be applicable to any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities and
expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of action, including,
legal fees and expenses, arising out of, based upon, related to, caused by or in
connection with (i) fraud, criminal activity or the knowing or intentional
misrepresentation, inaccuracy, non-performance, breach of or default in any
covenant, representation or warranty by the Company or its affiliates contained
in this Agreement, or (ii) those items listed on Schedule 10.3 attached hereto
(together with items stated in clause (i) of this proviso, the "Excluded Losses
and Costs.")

11.  Escrow Fund.

     11.1  Establishment of Escrow. At the Closing, the Escrow Shares shall be
registered in the name of, and be deposited with the Escrow Agent, such deposit
and any Additional Escrow Shares to constitute the Escrow Fund and to be
governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.  The Escrow
Shares shall be available to compensate Parent pursuant to the indemnification
obligations hereunder.  In the event Parent issues any Additional Escrow Shares
(as defined in the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E and
incorporated herein by reference), such shares will be issued in the name of the
Escrow Agent and delivered to the Escrow Agent in the same manner as the Escrow
Shares delivered at the Closing.

     For purposes of compensating Parent Indemnified Parties for its losses
pursuant to this Agreement, each share of Parent Common Stock released from

Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq on the date such share is released from the
escrow.

     11.2  Dispute Resolution.

          (a)  The parties desire that any controversy or claim arising out of
or related to this Agreement will be resolved in an expeditious and efficient
manner exclusively in accordance with this dispute resolution procedure. A
dispute under this clause shall be initiated by delivering written notice to the
other party briefly stating the nature of the dispute and requesting resolution.
Except as otherwise specified, each party shall bear its own costs and fees
relating to any dispute.

          (b)  The parties agree that before initiation of any legal or
arbitration proceeding with respect to any issue arising out of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, they shall cause their respective representatives
to attempt to resolve in good faith all disputes between the parties. The
parties agree that they will cause, in the case of Parent, Nancy Richardson or
her successor-in-interest, and, in the case of the Shareholders' Representative,
Jason Mendelson, or his successor-in-interest to meet in person in Dallas
County, Texas, to attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute within fifteen
(15) days of notification of such dispute. In the event that the representatives
are unable to resolve such dispute, the aggrieved party must refer the dispute
to mediation under paragraph (c).

          (c)  In the event any dispute is not resolved by a meeting of the
parties as described in paragraph (b) above, the dispute shall be referred to
non-binding mediation. The mediation shall occur within twenty (20) days of the
meeting of the parties as described in paragraph (b) above. Mediation fees shall
be split equally among the parties. The mediator shall be selected by agreement
of the parties or, in the event of no agreement, shall be designated by Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"). The mediation shall be attended by
the parties' representatives designated in paragraph (b) above and the parties'
attorneys.

          (d)  In the event such dispute is not resolved by mediation, the
aggrieved party shall refer the dispute to binding arbitration. The arbitration
shall be governed by the procedures set forth below. The arbitrator shall give
written notice to the parties of the arbitrator's

                                      57.
<PAGE>

determination, which shall be conclusive on the parties. The parties agree to
act in compliance with the arbitrator's determination, and upon such arbitration
determination, judgment upon the same may be entered by any court of competent
jurisdiction.

          (e)  Within thirty (30) days of referral of such dispute to
arbitration, a single arbitrator will be selected by agreement of the parties
or, in the event of no agreement, shall be designated by JAMS. Unless agreed
otherwise by the parties, the arbitrator shall be a retired judge with
arbitration experience.

          (f)  The parties agree to submit discovery plans to the arbitrator
within fifteen (15) days following the date that the arbitrator accepts his
appointment to this matter. The discovery plan will describe all discovery
contemplated. The arbitrator will schedule a meeting of counsel to occur within
fifteen (15) days of his receipt of the discovery plans, at which time the
arbitrator will issue a written order scheduling dates for all depositions and
completion dates for all additional discovery. The written discovery plan may
only be modified by a written order from the arbitrator.

          (g)  The arbitration hearing shall take place in Dallas County, Texas
within forty-five (45) days of the arbitrator's acceptance of his appointment.
The hearing is not to exceed two (2) days. Introduction of evidence and
testimony at the hearing will be subject to the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. Each party is entitled to be heard, to present material evidence and
testimony, and to cross-examine witness appearing at the hearing.

          (h)  The arbitrator may not award exemplary or punitive damages.

obligation or other provision set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of any

such breach or threatened breach.

     12.9  Waiver.  No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any

shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.  No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

     12.10  Amendments.  This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered by Parent and the Company.

     12.11  Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

     12.12  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the Related Agreements set
forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
among or between any of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

     12.13  Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies or obligations
under, or by reason of this Agreement, except that (i) the persons who are
Shareholders of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (and their
successors and assigns) are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries
