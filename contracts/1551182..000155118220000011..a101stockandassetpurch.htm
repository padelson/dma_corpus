Section 2.6 Consents to Certain Assignments; Specific Arrangements.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall not constitute
an agreement to transfer or assign any asset, permit, claim, right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment
thereof, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or
other contravention under any agreement or Law to which any Seller Entity or
Acquired Entity is a party or by which it is bound, or in any way adversely
affect the rights of any Seller Entity, Acquired Entity or, upon transfer, the
Buyer and the Buyer Designees (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Entities) under such asset, permit, claim or right (collectively, "Non-
Assignable Assets"). Prior to the Closing, and continuing for a period of 12
months following the Closing Date, the Seller shall use, and shall cause the
other Seller Entities to use, and the Buyer shall use, and shall cause the
Buyer Designees to use, their respective commercially reasonable 

efforts to obtain any consents or waivers required to assign to the Buyer or a
Buyer Designee any Non-Assignable Asset, without any conditions to such
transfer or changes or modifications of terms thereunder, and without any
obligation to pay any consent, approval or waiver fee, discount, rebate or any
money or other consideration to any Person. The Buyer agrees that none of the
Seller Entities or, prior to the Closing, the Acquired Entities shall have any
liability to the Buyer and the Buyer Designees (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Entities) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
such consent that may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or because of any
circumstances resulting therefrom, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. The Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty or
covenant of the Seller herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (i) the failure to
obtain any such consent or any circumstances resulting therefrom or (ii) any
suit, action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
such consent or any circumstances resulting therefrom, and that the Closing
shall proceed in accordance with this Agreement and the Buyer and/or the Buyer
Designees shall pay the full Estimated Purchase Price at the Closing without
the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or delivery of such Non-Assignable
Assets, in each case except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

(b) If any such consent is not obtained prior to Closing and as a result
thereof the Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall be prevented by such third party
from receiving the rights and benefits with respect to such Non-Assignable
Asset intended to be transferred hereunder, or if any attempted assignment
would adversely affect the rights of any Seller Entity or Acquired Entity, or,
after the Closing, the Buyer, a Buyer Designee or any Acquired Entity
thereunder so that the Buyer or a Buyer Designee or such Acquired Entity would
not in fact receive all such rights or the Buyer, the Buyer Designees or the
applicable Acquired Entity would forfeit or otherwise lose the benefit of
rights that such entity is entitled to retain, then until the earliest of (i)
such time as such consent is obtained, or such consent has been denied in
writing, (ii) 12 months following the Closing Date and (iii) with respect to a
Non-Assignable Asset that is a Contract, the expiration of the term of such
Contract in accordance with its current term or the execution of a replacement
Contract following the Closing by the Buyer, a Buyer Designee, an Acquired
Entity or an Affiliate of the Buyer, the Seller shall cooperate (and the
Seller shall cause the Seller Entities to cooperate) with the Buyer (and the
Buyer shall cause the Buyer Designees to cooperate) in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement, as the Seller and the Buyer shall agree,
under which the Buyer or a Buyer Designee would obtain the economic claims,
rights and benefits under such Non-Assignable Asset and assume the economic
burdens and obligations with respect thereto in accordance with this
Agreement, including by subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the
Buyer or a Buyer Designee; provided, that all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the applicable Seller Entity of such cooperation and related
actions shall be paid by the Buyer or a Buyer Designee. The Seller shall (and
shall cause the applicable Seller Entity to) promptly pay to the Buyer or a
Buyer Designee when received all monies received by the Seller Entities under
such Non-Assignable Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder and the Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall indemnify and promptly pay
the Seller for all reasonably incurred liabilities of the Seller Entities
associated with such Non-Assignable Asset.

(c) For so long as the Seller Entities hold any Non-Assignable Assets and
provide to the Buyer or a Buyer Designee any claims, rights and benefits of
any such Non-Assignable Assets pursuant to an arrangement described in the
foregoing Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b), the Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller and such Seller Entities and their respective
Affiliates from and against all Losses incurred or asserted as a result of the
Seller's or any such Affiliate's or their respective Affiliate's post-Closing
direct or indirect ownership, management or operation of any such Non-
Assignable Asset (only to the extent that such Losses relate to the Business
and are not Excluded Liabilities); provided, however, that none of the Buyer,
any Buyer Designee or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to
indemnify 

any Seller Entity of their respective Affiliates to the extent such party
seeking indemnification under this Section 2.6(c) has committed gross
negligence or willful misconduct with respect thereto. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any transfer or assignment to the
Buyer or a Buyer Designee of any Transferred Asset that shall require consent
as described above in the foregoing Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b) shall be
made subject to such consent being obtained.

Section 2.7 Closing Consideration. In consideration for the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Transferred Assets and the Acquired
Entity Equity Interests to the Buyer and the Buyer Designees, at the Closing,
the Buyer and the Buyer Designees shall (a) pay to the Seller on behalf of the

Section 2.9 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the
"Preliminary Closing Statement") setting forth a good-faith estimate of (i)
the Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), (ii)
Indebtedness of (A) the Acquired Entities and (B) the Seller Entities relating
to the Business (the "Estimated Indebtedness"), and (iii) Cash (the "Estimated
Cash"), each determined as of the Measurement Time (and, except for Estimated
Indebtedness, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby),
based on the Seller's books and records and other information available at the
Closing, and calculated on a basis consistent with the accounting principles,
practices, assumptions, conventions and policies used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements and to the extent not inconsistent therewith,
consistent with GAAP (the "Applicable Accounting Principles"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in 

this Agreement, any income Tax assets or liabilities (whether current or
deferred) of the Acquired Entities and the Seller Entities shall be excluded
from current assets and current liabilities and shall not be included in the
calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital, Closing Net Working Capital or
any component thereof. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Buyer shall
seek to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
computation of any of the items in the Preliminary Closing Statement;
provided, that if the parties are unable to resolve all such differences prior
to the Closing, the amounts of the Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness, and Estimated Cash as reflected in the Preliminary Closing
Statement shall be used for purposes of calculating the Estimated Purchase
Price on the Closing Date. In no event shall any item included in the
calculation of Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, or Estimated Net
Working Capital be counted more than once for the purposes hereof.

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Seller a written statement (the "Final Closing
Statement"), that shall include and set forth a calculation in reasonable
detail of the actual (i) Net Working Capital ("Closing Net Working Capital"),
(ii) Indebtedness of (A) the Acquired Entities and (B) the Seller Entities
relating to the Business ("Closing Indebtedness"), and (iii) Cash ("Closing
Cash"), each determined as of the Measurement Time (and, except for Closing
Indebtedness, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby).
The Final Closing Statement shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
Applicable Accounting Principles and this Agreement and shall exclude the
effect of any action or omission of the Buyer or its Affiliates following the
Closing. To the extent any actions following the Closing with respect to the
accounting books and records of the Seller on which the Final Closing
Statement and the foregoing calculations are to be based are not consistent
with the Applicable Accounting Principles, such changes shall not be taken
into account in preparing the Final Closing Statement or calculating amounts
reflected thereon. In no event shall any item included in the calculation of
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, or Closing Net Working Capital be counted
more than once for the purposes hereof.

(c) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 60th day
following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the Seller
delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of
Disagreement") specifying the nature and amount of any dispute as to the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and/or Closing Cash, as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement. The Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, and/or Closing Cash not specifically referenced in the Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review in
accordance with Section 2.9(d).

(d) During the 30-day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Seller to the Buyer, the parties shall seek to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and/or Closing Cash as specified
therein. Any disputed items resolved in writing between the Buyer and the
Seller within such 30-day period shall be final and binding with respect to
such items, and if the Buyer and the Seller agree in writing on the resolution
of any disputed item specified by the Seller in the Notice of Disagreement or
the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and
Closing Cash, the amounts so determined shall be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Buyer and the Seller have not
resolved all such differences by the end of such 30-day period, the Seller and
the Buyer shall submit, in writing, to an independent public accounting firm
(the "Independent Accounting Firm"), their briefs detailing their views as to
the correct nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the
amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and/or
Closing Cash, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written
determination as to each such disputed item and the amounts of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and/or Closing Cash. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to
act, such other independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed 

in writing by the Seller and the Buyer. The Buyer and the Seller shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm
to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within
30-days following the submission thereof. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts in the Buyer's and the Seller's
respective calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, and/or Closing Cash, that are identified as being items and
amounts to which the Buyer and the Seller have been unable to agree. The scope
of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
limited to correcting mathematical errors and determining whether the items
and amounts in dispute were determined in accordance with the Applicable
Accounting Principles and this Agreement and the Independent Accounting Firm
is not to make any other determination, including any determination as to
whether the Target Net Working Capital or any estimates on the Preliminary
Closing Statement are correct, adequate or sufficient. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Independent Accounting Firm's determination of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Indebtedness, and Closing Cash shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by the Buyer and the Seller (i.e., not on
independent review). Absent fraud or manifest error, the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
and shall not be subject to appeal or further review. Judgment may be entered
upon the written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in
accordance with Section 10.9. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall function solely as an expert and not as an arbitrator.

(e) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Buyer and the
Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each
party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing Statement or any Notice of Disagreement and in connection with the
resolution of any dispute pursuant to this Section 2.9, as applicable, shall
be borne by such party.

(f) The Buyer and the Seller will, and will cause the Acquired Entities (in
the case of the Seller, prior to the Closing and, in the case of the Buyer,
during the period from and after the date of delivery of the Final Closing
Statement through the resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 2.9) to afford the other party and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the Business (including those of the Acquired Entities) and to any other
information reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing the
calculations contemplated by this Section 2.9. Each party shall authorize its
accountants to disclose work papers generated by such accountants in
connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations specified in this
Section 2.9; provided, that such accountants shall not be obligated to make
any work papers available except in accordance with such accountants'
disclosure procedures and then only after the party who is not such
accountant's client has signed an agreement relating to access to such work
papers in form and substance acceptable to such accountants.

(g) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows:

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Net Adjustment Amount" means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) (1) the Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9 minus (2)
the Estimated Net Working Capital, minus (B) (1) the Closing Indebtedness as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9 minus (2) the Estimated
Indebtedness, 

plus (C) (1) the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.9 minus (2) the Estimated Cash;

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount, and the
Buyer shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Seller; and

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount, and the
Seller shall pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Buyer.

(h) Payments in respect of Section 2.9(g) shall be made within three Business
Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.9 by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the party
entitled to such payment at least two Business Days prior to such payment
date.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.9 is not intended to be used to
permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methodologies
(including with respect to accruals and reserves), policies, principles,
practices, procedures or classifications for purposes of calculating amounts
referred to in this Section 2.9, or to adjust for any inconsistencies between
the Applicable Accounting Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other.

Section 2.10 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) The Buyer and the Seller Entities shall allocate the Purchase Price,
Assumed Liabilities and any other amount treated as consideration for tax
purposes for the Transferred Assets, the Acquired Entity Equity Interests, the
Intellectual Property License Agreement and the Trademark License Agreement
among the Seller Entities in accordance with Section 2.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules (such allocation, the "Entity Allocation Schedule").

(b) This Section 2.10(b) shall apply to the allocation of the Purchase Price,
the Assumed Liabilities and any other amount treated as consideration for Tax
purposes for the Transferred Assets, the Acquired Entity Equity Interests, the
Intellectual Property License Agreement and the Trademark License Agreement by
the Buyer in accordance with the Entity Allocation Schedule and Section 1060
of the Code and the regulations thereunder and other similar Laws (as finally
determined under this Section 2.10(b), the "Allocation"). The Buyer shall
provide the Seller with a schedule containing the proposed Allocation within
sixty (60) Business Days of the date on which the Final Closing Statement is
finally determined. The Allocation proposed by the Buyer shall become final
and binding on the parties thirty (30) Business Days after the Buyer provides
such schedule to the Seller, unless the Seller objects in writing to the
Buyer, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for the objection and
preparing an alternative allocation. If the Seller does object pursuant to the
terms of the preceding sentence, the Seller and the Buyer shall attempt to
resolve the dispute within twenty (20) Business Days after written notice to
the Buyer of the Seller's objection. Any such resolution shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto. Any unresolved disputes shall be promptly
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, who shall be engaged to provide
a final, binding and conclusive resolution of all such unresolved disputes
within thirty (30) Business Days after such engagement in accordance with the
principles set out in Section 2.9. 

(c) Each of the parties agrees, unless otherwise required by Law, to (i)
prepare and timely file all Tax Returns (and all supplements thereto) in a
manner consistent with the Allocation as finalized under Section 2.10(b) and
(ii) act in accordance with such Allocation for all Tax purposes.

Section 2.11 Withholding. Except following the occurrence of an event
described in Section 1.1445-2(b)(4)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations or with
respect to the transfer of a "United States real property interest" (as
defined in Code Section 897(c)) by a Seller Entity organized in a non-U.S.
jurisdiction, the Buyer shall not be entitled to deduct and withhold under the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder from any amounts
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby so long as the
Seller delivers the certificate described in Section 2.8(c)(vii) not later
than the Closing. In addition, the Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold such amounts as it is required under other provisions of applicable
Law to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the case of any such withholding the
Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide written notice to the Seller of such party's intention to
withhold at least 10 Business Days prior to any such withholding and each of
the applicable parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
any such withholding. All amounts withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with this Section 2.11 shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as being timely paid to the
person with respect to which withholding was made.

as to the accuracy or completeness of any information concerning the Business,
the Acquired Entities, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities
contained herein or made available in connection with the Buyer's
investigation of the foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, and the Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives expressly
disclaim any and all liability that may be based on such information or errors
therein or omissions therefrom. The Buyer has not relied and is not relying on
any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied
(including any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for
a particular purpose), made by the Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article III hereof. Absent

the transactions contemplated hereby, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 4.8, "Solvent" means,
with respect to the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that: (a)
the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of
the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be greater than the
total amount of the liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not
reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether
direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or
undisputed) of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, shall be able to pay their debts and
obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due; and (c) the

Acquired Entity Equity Interests for investment purposes and not with a view
toward or for offer or resale in connection with any distribution thereof, or
with any present intention of offering, distributing or selling any of the

Entity Equity Interests have not been registered under the securities Laws of
any jurisdiction, including the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), or
any state securities Laws, and agrees that the Acquired Entity Equity
Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under any such
Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration available, or in
a transaction not subject to registration, under such Laws and without
compliance with any other Laws, in each case, to the extent applicable. The
Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 under the
Securities Act, and any Acquired Entity Equity Interests that the Buyer
receives, directly or indirectly, hereunder will be received only on its own 

behalf and its Affiliate assignees and not for the account or benefit of any
other person or entity. The Buyer is able to bear the economic risk of holding
the Acquired Entity Equity Interests for an indefinite period (including total
loss of its investment).

parties to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any covenant contained in this Section 5.3
should be determined to exceed the time, geographic, or other limitations
permitted by Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to
reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, or other limitations permitted

hereto shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any fact, change,
condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which
it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII of this Agreement becoming incapable of
being satisfied.

Section 5.6 Intercompany Arrangements. Immediately prior to the Closing, all
intercompany balances and accounts (other than trade payables and receivables
for products sold in the ordinary course, which shall remain outstanding and
be settled in accordance with their respective terms) between the Seller
Entities and any of their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), on
the one hand, and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand, shall be settled
or otherwise eliminated in such a manner as the Seller shall determine in its
reasonable discretion (including by the Seller Entities or any of their
Affiliates removing from any Acquired Entity cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities and other financial instruments or funds from cash pools
by means of dividends, distributions, contribution, the creation or repayment
of intercompany debt, increasing or decreasing of cash pool balances or
otherwise). Intercompany balances and accounts solely among any of the
Acquired Entities shall not be affected by this provision. Immediately prior
to the Closing, except for the Ancillary Agreements to be entered into in
connection with this Agreement, all arrangements, understandings or contracts,
including all obligations to provide goods, services or other benefits,
between the Seller Entities or their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Entities), on the one hand, and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand,
shall automatically be terminated without further payment or performance and
cease to have any further force and effect, such that no party thereto shall
have any further obligations therefor or thereunder.

Section 5.7 Employee Benefits and Employment Matters.

(a) Continuity of Employment for all Business Employees.

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Acquired Entities, as applicable,
and to the extent permissible under Law and any agreement with an Employee
Representative (as defined below), shall transfer the employment of those
individuals who are not Business Employees employed by any Acquired Entity out
of the Acquired Entity employing such individual, or to otherwise terminate
the employment of such individuals with the Acquired Entity, and the Seller
shall be solely responsible for all liabilities, costs and expenses related to
such actions and all liabilities, costs and expenses related to such
individuals, irrespective of when such liabilities, costs and/or expenses may
arise.

(ii) To the extent applicable, the parties acknowledge the application of the
European Council Directive of March 12, 2001 (2001/23/EC) (the "Directive"),
relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of
undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses and any country legislation
implementing the Directive and any other similar Law (collectively, the
"Transfer Regulations"). The Buyer and the Seller shall take all such actions
that may be necessary or required to cause the Transfer Regulations to apply
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Buyer and the Seller shall
refrain from taking any action that could cause the Transfer Regulations not
to apply to such transactions. Seller shall remain responsible for all
liabilities, costs, and expenses related to any Business Employee who objects
or refuses to transfer to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer (including
any Acquired Entity) as required by the Transfer Regulations.

(iii) Except for any individual set forth on Schedule 5.7(a)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedules, no later than 15 days prior to the Closing, the Buyer
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, offer employment to each Business
Employee not employed by an Acquired Entity, in a substantially similar
geographic location, and such offer of employment shall include [***].
Business Employees who accept 

such offers of employment from the Buyer are referred to herein as
"Transferred Seller Entity Employees". If required under Law or as otherwise
reasonably requested by the Seller for purposes of effecting the transfer of
employment from the Seller to the Buyer, and to the extent permissible under
the agreements with any Employee Representative (as defined below), the Buyer
shall, and the Seller shall cause the applicable Seller Entities to, enter
into any tri-party, employer substitution or other similar agreements with
respect to any Business Employees to effect an employer substitution under Law
in a manner that implements the applicable provisions of this Agreement, in
each case effective as of the Closing Date. The Seller shall, or shall cause
the appropriate member of the Seller Entities to, terminate the employment of
each Transferred Seller Entity Employee as of the Closing Date. The Seller
shall be solely responsible for all liabilities, costs, and expenses related
to such actions described herein and any transfer of employment of the
Transferred Seller Entity Employees, including any liabilities that may arise
in connection with any Business Employee who rejects an offer of employment
from the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer or any Business Employee who
objects or refuses to transfer to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer
(including any Acquired Entity) at the Closing.

(b) At the Closing, the employment of each Business Employee employed by an
Acquired Entity shall continue with the applicable Acquired Entity, as
applicable, in accordance with Law (each such Business Employee, an "Acquired
Entity Employee", and the Acquired Entity Employees, together with the
Transferred Seller Entity Employees, collectively, the "Transferred
Employees"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer and
any Affiliate of the Buyer (including the Acquired Entities) shall be timely
reimbursed by the Seller for any liabilities, costs, or expenses, including
any employee compensation or employee benefit liabilities, costs, or expenses,
that transfer by operation of Law to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Acquired Entity) related to any employees who are not Business
Employees.

(c) The Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, provide or
cause to be provided to such Transferred Employee for the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
employment in a substantially similar geographic location, and with [***].
Such employment by the Buyer or its Affiliates shall commence effective as of
the Closing Date, and shall be deemed for all purposes to have occurred with
no interruption or break in service.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that any
Business Employee who is not an Acquired Entity Employee is on long-term
disability, short-term disability, or similar leave as of the Closing, then,
to the extent permissible under Law and under any agreement with any Employee
Representative (as defined below), such Business Employee shall remain
employed by the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller. Those Business Employees
who are both (i) not Acquired Entity Employees and (ii) on short-term
disability, long-term disability, or similar leave as of the Closing shall not
be Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date, and instead shall be provided
with offers of employment from an Acquired Entity, the Buyer, or an Affiliate
of the Buyer if they return to active employment within the 6 months following
the Closing Date. The Buyer and any Affiliate of the Buyer (including the
Acquired Entities) shall be timely reimbursed by the Seller for any
liabilities, costs, or expenses, including any employee compensation or
employee benefit liabilities, costs, or expenses related to the employment of
any Acquired Entity Employee who is on long-term disability, short-term
disability, or similar leave as of the Closing for the period of time from the
Closing until the termination of such leave.

(e) Effective as of the Closing, the Seller or the applicable Affiliate of the
Seller shall terminate the participation of each Transferred Employee and his
or her eligible dependents in each Employee Plan (other than any Employee Plan
(including any Non-US Employee Plan) sponsored by one of the Acquired
Entities). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer and any
Affiliate of the Buyer (including the Acquired Entities) shall not have any
liability with respect to any Employee Plan (including any Non- 

US Employee Plan) other than any Employee Plan (including any Non-US Employee
Plan) sponsored by one of the Acquired Entities or as required by Law or the
terms of any tri-party, employer substitution or other similar agreements
entered into pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, subject to the
provisions regarding allocation of pre-Closing liability set forth in Section
5.7(h) and Section 5.7(l) hereto or as otherwise included as Indebtedness or
Net Working Capital.

(f) The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, undertake all
provision of information and documentation to, and notice to, and
consultations, discussions or negotiations with, any unions, work councils and
other employee representatives which represent Business Employees
(collectively, the "Employee Representatives") to the extent required by Law
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
drafting of all information notices required thereby. To the extent required
by Law, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall cooperate with respect to the
foregoing, including by providing such information and documentation as the
Seller and its Affiliates or any Employee Representative may reasonably
request.

(g) Service Credit. The Buyer shall cause the Transferred Employees to receive
credit for all periods of employment and/or service with the Seller and its
Affiliates (including service with predecessor employers, where such credit
was provided by the Seller or its Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of eligibility and vesting including for purposes of satisfying any
service requirements for early retirement under any employee benefit plan
adopted by the Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to Transferred Employees.

(h) Employee Benefits--General. The Buyer, for at least one year following the
Closing Date, shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the Transferred
Employees with employee benefits [***]; provided, that, nothing herein shall
limit the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer (including the Acquired Entities)
from transitioning the Transferred Employees to certain broad-based employee
benefit plans of the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer following the Closing
Date so long as such plans fulfill the obligations of the Buyer set forth in
this Section 5.7. The Seller shall bear, or cause its Affiliates to bear, the
expense of and responsibility for all liabilities arising from claims by the
Business Employees for benefits attributable to periods prior to, on, or after
the Closing Date under the Employee Plans maintained by the Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities); provided, however, that the
Buyer shall bear, or cause its Affiliates to bear, the expense of and
responsibility for all liabilities arising from claims by the Transferred
Employees for benefits attributable to periods on or after the Closing Date
under the benefit plans maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Entities). For purposes of determining whether liability for
benefit claims is incurred prior to, or on or following the Closing Date,
claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (i) with respect to short-
term disability, long-term disability, life and accidental death and
dismemberment benefits, upon the event giving rise to such benefits, and (ii)
with respect to medical, dental, vision care, prescription and health-related
benefits, upon provision of medical, dental, vision, prescription and health-
related services, materials or supplies. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, except as may be specifically required by Law or by a
collective bargaining agreement, the Buyer shall not be obligated to continue
to provide any particular employee benefits to any Transferred Employee or to
continue the employment of any Transferred Employee. For the avoidance of
doubt, any claims under the Employee Plans and Non-US Employee Plans of the
Acquired Entities that relate to the period prior to the Measurement Time
shall be included in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or
Indebtedness, as applicable.

(i) Defined Contribution Plans. The Buyer agrees to have in effect, or cause
one of its Affiliates to have in effect, on the Closing Date, a defined
contribution plan that covers Transferred Employees based in the United
States, the terms of which meet the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the 

Code (such plan or plans, the "Buyer Savings Plan"). Each Transferred Employee
who is eligible to contribute to the Seller's or its Affiliate's contribution
plan (the "Seller Savings Plan") on the Closing Date shall be eligible to
contribute to the Buyer Savings Plan commencing on the day after the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall allow the Transferred Employees to roll over their
account balances (including loan balances) from the Seller Savings Plan
accrued through the Closing Date into their new accounts under the Buyer
Savings Plan promptly after the Closing Date, but in no event later than 90
days after the Closing Date or in contravention of ERISA or the Code.

(j) Welfare Benefit Plans.

(i) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer, or cause its
Affiliates to offer, the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
participation in the medical plans of the Buyer or its Affiliates. With
respect to other welfare benefit plans, including medical, dental, life
insurance, and short- and long-term disability (all of such welfare plans,
including the Buyer's or its Affiliate's medical plan described in the
previous sentence, the "Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans"), the Buyer shall offer,
or cause its Affiliates to offer, such other welfare benefit plans to the
Transferred Employees as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. The Buyer
shall cause all waiting periods and pre-existing condition clauses to be
waived under the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans for the Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents who were participating in the welfare benefits plans
and programs of the Seller and its Affiliates before the Closing Date. The
Buyer shall cause the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans to recognize any out-of-
pocket medical and dental expenses incurred by each of the Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the Closing Date and during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of determining
deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums under the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans
(the Seller shall provide such information to the Buyer at or prior to the
Closing).

(ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall assume all
responsibilities and obligations for continuation coverage under Sections 601
et seq. of ERISA ("COBRA Obligations") and any state or non-United States
continuation coverage requirements with respect to the Transferred Employees
and their beneficiaries. The Seller agrees that it shall retain responsibility
for COBRA Obligations to all qualified beneficiaries of covered employees for
whom a "qualifying event" under COBRA occurs prior to or on the Closing Date.

(k) Flexible Spending Accounts. To the extent any Transferred Employee was
participating in an Employee Plan that provides for qualified flexible
spending accounts for medical, dental, vision or dependent care expenses as of
immediately prior to the Closing (any such plan, a "Seller FSA Plan"), the
Buyer shall, on the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, permit each such Transferred Employee to be
eligible to participate in a Buyer Welfare Benefit Plan that provides for
qualified flexible spending accounts for medical or dependent care expenses,
as applicable (any such plan, a "Buyer FSA Plan"). On the Closing Date, the
Seller shall transfer or cause to be transferred from the Seller FSA Plans to
the Buyer FSA Plans the account balances (whether positive or negative) of
such Transferred Employees, and the Buyer shall be responsible for the
obligations of the Seller FSA Plans to provide benefits to the Transferred
Employees with respect to such transferred account balances at or after the
Closing Date, whether or not claims are incurred prior to, on or after the
Closing Date. Each Transferred Employee who participated in the Seller FSA
Plan shall be permitted to continue to have payroll deductions made as in
effect for such Transferred Employee under the Buyer FSA Plan after the
Closing Date. This Section 5.7(k) shall be interpreted and administered in a
manner consistent with Rev. Rul. 2002-32.

(l) Vacation and Leave Benefits; Bonuses and Commissions. From and after the
Closing Date the Buyer shall recognize, or cause its Affiliates to recognize,
and permit the Transferred Employees 

to use, all of the Transferred Employees' accrued and unused vacation days and
other leave (the Seller shall provide such information to the Buyer at or
prior to the Closing) to the extent such accrued vacation, holidays and leave
for all Transferred Employees is included as Net Working Capital. The Buyer
shall recognize, or cause its Affiliates to recognize, service by each
Transferred Employee with the Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of
determining entitlement to vacation or other leave under the applicable
policies of the Buyer or its Affiliates. With respect to the Transferred
Employees, and only to the extent taken into account as Net Working Capital,
the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) shall honor and
pay to the Transferred Employees all accrued bonuses and commissions and any
other bonuses and commissions that relate to the pre-Closing period to the
extent, and at such times as, such amounts become due and payable following
the Closing Date.

(m) Employee Information. Provided that the Buyer has entered into a Personal
Data Transfer Agreement acceptable to the Seller, the Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer, within 15 days prior to Closing, to the extent permitted by Law,
and again on the Closing Date, a list of each Business Employee, such Business
Employee's base salary and bonus opportunities, the Business Employee's date
of hire and the primary geographic location of his or her employment with the
Seller or its Affiliates, and status with respect to the following categories:
(i) active, (ii) inactive on leave of absence with reemployment rights (iii)
on short-term disability under the Seller's or its Affiliate's short-term
disability policy and (iv) whether such Business Employee is an Acquired
Entity Employee or is intended to be a Transferred Seller Entity Employee.

(n) WARN Act. The Buyer agrees to provide or cause its Affiliates to provide
any required notice under the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification
Act of 1988 (the "WARN Act") and any similar state or non-U.S. statute, and
otherwise to comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing"
or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar
event affecting Transferred Employees and occurring after the Closing Date.
The Seller agrees to provide or cause its Affiliates to provide any required
notice under the WARN Act, and any similar state or non-U.S. statute, and
otherwise to comply with any such statute with respect to any "plant closing"
or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar
event affecting Business Employees and occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Seller shall provide the Buyer
with an anonymized list of all employees of each Acquired Entity and all other
Business Employees who were terminated by the Seller, an Affiliate of the
Seller (other than any Acquired Entity), or any Acquired Entity within 90 days
of the Closing Date.

(o) With respect to those agreements that are assignable, the Seller and its
Affiliates (excluding any Acquired Entity) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Buyer to assign to the Buyer or an Affiliate of
the Buyer on the Closing Date (to the extent not already assigned to any
Acquired Entity in connection with the transfer of such Transferred Employees
to the Acquired Entity) all restrictive covenant agreements by and between any
Transferred Employee and the Seller or any Affiliate (other than any Acquired
Entity) in place as of the Closing Date.

(p) The Seller shall remain responsible for the payment of all nonqualified
deferred compensation due to the Transferred Employees under any Employee Plan
or Non-US Employee Plan.

(q) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall establish a replacement
program to compensate Transferred Employees for [***]. 

(r) The Seller and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) shall
cooperate with the Buyer and its Affiliates to effectuate the transfer of
employees as set forth in this Section 5.7 and to establish payroll and
employee benefit plans and programs to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(s) The Buyer agrees that (i) from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer
and/or one of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed the employer of the Transferred
Employees for purposes of any collective bargaining agreements covering any of
the Transferred Employees (and the Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer to
effect the same) and (ii) prior to, on or after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall, or shall cause its appropriate Subsidiary to, provide any documentation
evidencing the status of the Buyer or such Subsidiary as such employer
following the Closing Date to the unions representing any of the Transferred
Employees under such collective bargaining agreements; provided, that, nothing
herein shall result in an allocation of liability to the Buyer or an Affiliate
of the Buyer (including the Acquired Entities) that is in excess of such
liabilities allocated to the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer (including the
Acquired Entities) pursuant to this Agreement.

(t) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing herein express or implied by this
Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 5.16) shall confer upon any
Business Employee, or legal representative thereof, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or benefits for any specified period, of any
nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 5.8 Confidentiality. Each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause
its Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of the other party and its respective
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated July 1, 2019, between the
Buyer and the Seller (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall continue
in full force and effect after the Closing Date in accordance with its terms.
Without limiting any of the foregoing or the terms set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Entities to keep confidential any confidential or proprietary
information (including any Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement)) about the Seller or its Affiliates, except to the
extent that the Buyer can show that such information (a) is generally
available to and known by the public through no fault of the Buyer, any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities after the Closing) or their
respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by the Buyer, any of
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities after the Closing) or their
respective Representatives from and after the Closing from sources that to the
Buyer's knowledge after reasonable inquiry are not prohibited from disclosing
such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities after the Closing)
or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information
by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, then
the Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in writing and shall disclose, or
cause its Affiliates to disclose, only that portion of such information that
the Buyer is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be
disclosed; provided, however, that the Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.9 Consents and Filings; Further Assurances.

(a) Each of the parties shall use take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under Law or otherwise to consummate and 

make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable, including to (i) obtain from
Governmental Authorities or any other party all consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements (each, a "Governmental Approval") and (ii) as soon as
reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
or as mutually agreed by antitrust counsel of each party, filing with the FTC
and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the
HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and
submissions required or deemed advisable under the Antitrust Laws in any other
jurisdictions. The Buyer shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the
filing under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertaking pursuant to
Section 5.9(a), the Buyer agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as
to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable and in no event later
than the Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, (i) the sale
or disposal of assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Acquired Entities or the Transferred Assets; (ii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Acquired Entities (including with respect to the
Transferred Assets); (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv)
creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Acquired Entities (including with respect to the Transferred
Assets) or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Buyer,
its Affiliates or the Acquired Entities (including with respect to the
Transferred Assets) ((i)-(v), a "Detriment Action") in order to avoid any
injunction (or to effect the dissolution thereof), temporary restraining order
or other order or decision in any suit or proceeding, or to delay in the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of such transactions. In addition, the Buyer shall defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
Closing by the Termination Date. Nothing in this agreement shall require any
of the Seller Entities to agree or otherwise commit to (i) any sale,
divestiture, or disposition of the Seller Entities' assets or businesses other
than the Transferred Assets or the Acquired Entities, (ii) any order, consent
decree, or other contract or agreement that would, directly or indirectly,
limit, amend, or otherwise impact its existing or future contractual rights,
assets, conduct, or businesses other than with respect to the Transferred
Assets or the Acquired Entities, or (iii) any Detriment Action that is not
conditioned on the Closing.

(c) If, following consultation between the parties, there is a disagreement
between the parties about antitrust strategy, the Buyer's decision will
control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer
has the sole right to control and direct antitrust strategy in connection with
review by any Governmental Authority of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any action by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Authority
or other Person relating to the transactions and will take the lead in all
meetings, discussions and communications with any Governmental Authority
relating to obtaining antitrust approval for the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Buyer and the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to:

(i) promptly notify the other party of any substantive communication it or any
of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority; 

(ii) not participate in any meeting or substantive discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting or discussion. Subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods
including under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws, to the extent
applicable; and

(iii) subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, provide each other with copies
of all substantive correspondence, filings or communications between them or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) The Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take
any action (including acquiring or agreeing to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise
acquiring or agreeing to acquire any assets) that would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of (i) delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of, or
increasing the risk of not receiving, any required Governmental Approval, (ii)
delaying, impairing or impeding the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period with respect to a Governmental Approval, (iii)
increasing the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or (iv) otherwise delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

(e) CFIUS Approval.

(i) Each of the Buyer, the Seller Entities, and the Acquired Entities shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, CFIUS
Approval.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.9(e)(i), as promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than
30 Business Days after the date hereof, the Buyer, the Seller Entities and
Acquired Entities shall prepare, pre-file and then, as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to
Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall provide
CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS or
its constituent agencies during the review process as promptly as practicable,
and in all cases within the amount of time allowed by CFIUS.

(iii) The Buyer shall take any and all actions necessary, proper or advisable,
to obtain CFIUS Approval as soon as practicable and feasible, in accordance
with the CFIUS timetable, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise taking any
Detriment Action necessary to obtain CFIUS Approval. Nothing in this agreement
shall require any of the Seller Entities, in connection with CFIUS Approval,
to agree or otherwise commit to (A) any sale, divestiture, or disposition of
the Seller Entities' assets or businesses other than the Transferred Assets or
the Acquired Entities, (B) any order, consent decree, or other contract or
agreement that would, directly or indirectly, limit, amend, or otherwise
impact its existing or future contractual rights, assets, conduct, or
businesses other than with respect to the Transferred Assets or the Acquired
Entities, or (C) any Detriment Action. 

(iv) Each of the Buyer, the Seller Entities, and the Acquired Entities shall
promptly furnish to the other copies of any notices or written communications
received by such party or any of its affiliates from CFIUS or any of its
constituent agencies with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless otherwise prohibited by any Governmental Authority or Law,
and each of the Buyer, the Seller Entities, and the Acquired Entities shall
permit the other's counsel to have an opportunity to review in advance, and
such party shall consider in good faith the views of such counsel in
connection with, any proposed written communications by such party or its
affiliates to CFIUS concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Buyer, the Seller
Entities, and the Acquired Entities may, as such party deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive materials or
information provided to the other party under this Section 5.9(e)(iv) as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the other party, and such
party shall cause such outside counsel not to disclose such materials or
information to any employees, officers, directors or other representatives of
the Seller Entities and Acquired Entities, unless express written permission
is obtained in advance from the party providing such materials and
information. Each of the Buyer, the Seller Entities, and the Acquired Entities
shall provide the other and its counsel the opportunity, on reasonable advance
notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or discussions between such
party or any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and
CFIUS, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.10 Release of Guarantees. The parties shall cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the Seller and its
Affiliates from any obligations any of them have relating to guarantees,
letters of credit, performance bonds, bid bonds and other similar agreements
that guarantee obligations of the Business as they relate to the period after
the Closing (collectively, the "Guarantees"), including those listed on
Schedule 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedules (certain of which are Guarantees
provided by the Seller or an Affiliate and certain of which are Guarantees
provided by a third party for the benefit of the Business). In the event any
of the Guarantees are not released prior to or at the Closing, the Buyer will
indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless for any and all
payments required to be made by the Seller under, and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in connection with, such obligations relating to
such Guarantees (other than the costs set forth in the next two sentences),
with respect to activities of the Business after the Closing. If any Guarantee
is provided by a third party and a fee is payable to such third party in
connection with the release of such Guarantee (or a fee is due upon
termination of, or release from, the related credit facility or other
arrangement), then the Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any such

shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to the Buyer and (ii)
if the Buyer or any of its Affiliates receive any refund or other amount that
is an Excluded Asset or is otherwise properly due and owing to the Seller or

by the Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities)), the Buyer
shall transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates 

(including the Acquired Entities) to transfer to the Seller at the Seller's
sole cost and expense, at no cost to the Buyer, such right, property or asset
as soon as practicable to the Seller Entity indicated by the Seller. If,

directly or indirectly, the Seller shall transfer, or shall cause the other
Seller Entities to transfer to the Buyer or a Buyer Designee, at no cost to
the Buyer or such Buyer Designee, such right, interest, property or asset as
soon as practicable to the Buyer or an Affiliate (including an Acquired

activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction relating to, in connection with or arising from the Business,

the contesting or defending party, reasonably cooperate with such contesting
or defending party and its Representatives in such contest or defenses,
including making available its personnel and providing such testimony and
access to its non-privileged books and records as shall be reasonably
necessary in connection with such contest or defense, in each case to the
extent reasonably practicable, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice and at the sole cost of the contesting or defending
party (unless such party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article
VIII, in which case the costs and expenses shall be borne by the Indemnifying
Party as set forth in Article VIII).

Section 5.13 Insurance.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Acquired Entities shall cease to be
insured by the Seller's and its Affiliates' respective current and historical
insurance policies or programs and by any of their current and historical
self-insured programs and, except as set forth in Section 2.2(m), none of the
Buyer, the Acquired Entities or their respective Affiliates shall have any
access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies,
programs or self-insured programs (including to all claims or rights to make
claims and all rights to proceeds, including under any occurrence-based
policies of the Seller and its Affiliates with respect to pre-Closing periods)
to cover any assets of any of the Acquired Entities or any liability arising
from the operation of the Business. The Seller and its Affiliates may,
effective at or after the Closing, amend any insurance policies and ancillary
arrangements in the manner they deem appropriate to give effect to this
Section 5.13(b). The Buyer shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for its operation of the Acquired Entities and the
Business from and after the Closing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.13(a), prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall provide all reasonable assistance to the Buyer
to enable the Buyer to assess the insurance needs of the Business and to
subscribe for such insurances effective as of Closing; provided, that neither
the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to make any payment,
provide any guarantee or enter into any agreement in providing reasonable
assistance to the Buyer.

(c) This Agreement shall not be considered an attempted assignment of any
policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be construed
to waive any right or remedy of the Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect
of any insurance policy or any other contract or policy of insurance. 

(d) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall
cause the Seller Entities and Acquired Entities to, continue to make and
pursue claims under any insurance policy for any Loss that is an Assumed
Liability or that negatively impacts the value of a Transferred Asset that is
covered by such policies, in each case, in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices.

(e) Notwithstanding anything elsewhere in this Section 5.13 to the contrary,
the Seller and its Affiliates may amend or terminate any insurance policy so
long as the Seller provides the Buyer notice of such amendments or
terminations to the extent such amendments or terminations affect the rights
or obligations of the Acquired Entities.

the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither party shall

other party's written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law or any listing agreement of any party or its
Affiliates; provided, that the Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives
may disclose any information concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including providing updates as to the status thereof) that it deems
appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of the Seller's status as a
publicly owned company, including to securities analysts and institutional
investors and in press interviews.

Section 5.16 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the
Acquired Entities to, take any actions necessary to provide that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any
current or former directors, officers, partners, members, managers or
employees of any of the Acquired Entities (or their respective predecessors),
as provided in any agreement with, or the Organizational Documents of, the
applicable Acquired Entities shall survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect and be honored by the Acquired Entities after the Closing in
accordance with their respective terms, for a period of not less than 6 years.

(b) In the event that any of the Acquired Entities, the Buyer or any Buyer
Designee (or any of their respective successors or assigns) (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, the Buyer will or will cause its applicable Affiliate
to make proper provisions so that the successors and assigns of the Acquired
Entities or the Buyer or any of their Affiliates, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.16.

Section 5.17 Local Transfer Agreements.

(a) The parties do not intend this Agreement to transfer title to any
Transferred Assets, or to constitute the assumption of any Assumed
Liabilities, in any jurisdiction in which such transfer or assumption is
required by Law to be made pursuant to a Local Transfer Agreement, and any
such Transferred 

Assets or Assumed Liabilities, as applicable, shall only be transferred or
assumed by the applicable Local Transfer Agreement. The Local Transfer
Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer of the applicable
Transferred Assets, or the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities, in the
applicable jurisdictions. For the avoidance of doubt, the Local Transfer
Agreements shall not have any effect on the value being given or received by
the Seller, the Buyer or a Buyer Designee, including the allocation of assets
and liabilities as between them, all of which shall be determined solely in
accordance with this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of Section 5.17(a), if, and to the extent
that, the provisions of a Local Transfer Agreement are inconsistent with, or
(except to the extent they implement a transfer in accordance with this
Agreement) additional to, the provisions of this Agreement (or do not fully
give effect to the provisions of this Agreement with respect to the transfer
of the Transferred Assets or the assumption of Assumed Liabilities): (i) the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail and (ii) so far as permissible
under Law of the relevant jurisdiction, the parties shall cause the provisions
of the relevant Local Transfer Agreement to be adjusted, to the extent
necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

(c) No party shall, and each party shall cause its respective Affiliates not
to, bring any claim against the other party or any of its Affiliates in
respect of or based upon any of the Local Transfer Agreements, except to the
extent necessary to enforce any transfer of the Transferred Assets or
assumption of Assumed Liabilities sold or assigned to the Buyer or a Buyer
Designee hereunder in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Except as referred to above, all such claims shall be brought in accordance
with, and be subject to the provisions, rights and limitations set out in,
this Agreement, and no party shall be entitled to recover any Losses or obtain
payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity under or pursuant to any of
the Local Transfer Agreements.

Section 5.18 Audit. Prior to Closing, the Seller shall have audited and
deliver to the Buyer the Balance Sheet and the related statement of income of
the Business as of the date of the Balance Sheet, together with all related
notes and schedules thereto.

parties will cooperate to take the actions described on Annex A-5 (the
"Separation Actions") at the locations listed thereon (the "Separation
Locations") with respect to the separation of the activities relating to the
Business and the other activities conducted by the Seller and its Affiliates
at such locations. The parties will consult with each other regarding the most
reasonable and cost-effective means to accomplish the Separation Actions,
taking into account the activities conducted at each Separation Location and
the anticipated duration of the relevant lease.

ARTICLE VI 
TAX MATTERS

Section 6.1 Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Seller, at its sole cost and expense,
shall cause to be prepared and timely filed (i) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed with respect to the Acquired Entities on or prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) all income Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to
the Acquired Entities for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date (all such Tax Returns are referred to as the "Prior Period Returns"). The
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes related to such Prior Period
Returns. All Prior Period Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice and without a change of any election or any accounting
method of any Acquired Entity, except as required by Law or any change in the
Business. The Seller shall not amend any Prior Period Return of an Acquired
Entity without the prior written consent of the Buyer. The Buyer shall
promptly make available to the Seller (and to the 

Seller's accountants and attorneys) its personnel and any and all books and
records and other documents and information in its possession or control
relating to the Acquired Entities reasonably requested by the Seller to
prepare the Prior Period Returns.

Section 6.2 Buyer Filed Returns. Following the Closing, the Buyer shall cause
to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to
the Acquired Entities that are not Prior Period Returns (each a "Buyer Filed
Return"). The Buyer shall prepare all Buyer Filed Returns which relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period in a manner consistent with the Acquired Entities' past
practices, except as otherwise required by Law. The Buyer shall deliver to the
Seller, for the Seller's review and comment, a draft of each Buyer Filed
Return that shows an Indemnified Tax or that is an income Tax Return relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period at least 45 days prior to the applicable filing
deadline of such Buyer Filed Return, together with a proposed calculation of
the Indemnified Taxes shown on such Tax Return. Within 20 days following
receipt thereof, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer written notice of any
objection with respect to the Buyer Filed Return or the portion of such Taxes
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. If the parties are unable to resolve
any disputes with respect to such calculations within 5 days following
delivery of the Seller's notice of objection, such dispute shall be submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, which resolution shall be
final and binding upon the parties, and the return shall not be filed by the
Buyer prior to the resolution of the dispute submitted for resolution to the
Independent Accounting Firm. No delay of the Buyer in providing Buyer Filed
Returns for the Seller to review shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations or liabilities of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement except to
the extent the Seller is actually prejudiced by such delay, and the Seller
shall not be required to make any Tax payment to the Buyer until after the
submission and filing of the applicable Buyer Filed Return to the proper
Governmental Authority.

Section 6.3 Straddle Period Tax Apportionment. For purposes of determining the
amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period:

(a) In the case of Taxes not imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such
Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) The amount of any Taxes that are determined on a periodic basis for a
Straddle Period that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Taxes imposed on any
Acquired Entity or the Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party as a result
of income of any Flow-Thru Entity realized prior to the Closing Date (such
income being computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on
the Closing Date and closed its books), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes
of the appropriate Acquired Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

Section 6.4 Tax Indemnity. Following the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify
and hold the Buyer, its Affiliates and the Acquired Entities harmless from and
against any Indemnified Taxes.

Section 6.5 Audits and Other Proceedings. The Buyer shall promptly notify the
Seller following receipt of any notice of audit or other proceeding relating
to any Tax matter for which the Seller may be required to indemnify the Buyer,
its Affiliates and the Acquired Entities pursuant to this Agreement (a "Tax
Contest" ). No delay by the Buyer shall reduce any of the Seller's obligations
for Indemnified Taxes, except to the extent such delay actually prejudices the
Seller. The Seller shall have the right to control any and all audits or other
proceedings relating solely to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a
Straddle Period). If 

the Seller assumes such defense, the Seller shall diligently and in good faith
keep the Buyer reasonably informed, shall allow the Buyer to participate in
the defense thereof (including employing counsel separate from the counsel
employed by the Seller), and shall not settle, resolve or abandon such Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Buyer shall control any
and all audits or other proceedings relating to any Straddle Period. The Buyer
shall diligently and in good faith keep the Seller reasonably informed
regarding, shall allow the Seller to participate in the defense of (including
employing counsel separate from the counsel employed by the Buyer), and shall
not settle, resolve or abandon such Tax Contest without the prior written
consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

Section 6.6 Tax Benefits.

(a) Subject to Section 6.6(c), following the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to
the Seller the amount of any cash refund or realized Tax credit realized by
the Buyer, its Affiliates or any Acquired Entity with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period (net of any reasonable third-party out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Acquired Entities in obtaining such refund or credit or any Taxes
incurred on a distribution of such refund to the Buyer). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Buyer acknowledges that the amounts which are for the benefit of
the Seller pursuant to in this Section 6.6 constitute Excluded Assets.

(b) If, subsequent to the payment by the Buyer to the Seller of any refund,
credit, or offset, there shall be (i) a determination within the meaning of
Section 1313 of the Code (or an analogous provision of state and local Law)
which results in a disallowance or a reduction of the refund, credit, or
offset so carried forward or (ii) a reduction or disallowance of any Tax
refund or credit or offset, the Seller shall repay to the Buyer any amount
which would not have been payable to the Seller pursuant to this Section
6.6(b) had the amount of the payment been determined in light of such
determination.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall require that the Buyer make any payment
with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for the
benefit of the Buyer and the Acquired Entities) that is with respect to (i)
any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back of any net operating
loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred in any Tax period (or
portion of any Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) any
refund for Tax that is reflected as a current asset (or offset to a current
liability) on the Closing Net Working Capital, or (iii) any refund for Tax
that gives rise to a payment obligation by any Acquired Entity to any Person
(other than an Acquired Entity or any Affiliate thereof) under Law or pursuant
to a provision of a contract or other agreement entered (or assumed) by any
Acquired Entity on or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 6.7 Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Buyer may not file any amended Tax Return relating to Taxes for
which the Seller may be required to indemnify the Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

Section 6.8 Transfer Taxes. Except for any such amounts that can be offset by
the Buyer or the Seller against other Taxes payable by such party (in which
case such amounts will be borne solely by such party), the Buyer and the
Seller shall each be liable for fifty percent (50%) of all sales taxes,
transfer taxes, stamp taxes, conveyance taxes, value-added taxes, mortgage
taxes, intangible taxes, documentary recording taxes, license and registration
fees, and recording fees imposed by any Governmental Authority upon the
transfer of the Transferred Assets hereunder and the filing of any instruments
("Transfer Taxes"). The party required under Law shall prepare all Transfer
Tax Returns in connection therewith and the other party shall join in the
filing of any such Returns to the extent required by Law. For the avoidance of
doubt, Transfer 

Taxes shall not include income or capital gains tax imposed on any Seller
Entity as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, Taxes required to be paid pursuant to
Announcement 7. The Seller and the Buyer shall take all reasonable steps to
minimize any Transfer Taxes or to obtain any Tax credit, refund or going
concern or other exemption, and neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall take
any action that will prevent the other from obtaining any such credit, refund
or exemption.

Section 6.9 PRC Taxes. The Seller shall, and shall cause any relevant Seller
Entity to, comply with any required Tax reporting, filing or payment
obligations under Announcement 7 (as well as any voluntary reporting
requirements thereunder), and shall give the Buyer a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any reporting to be made with respect thereto to the
relevant Tax authority of the PRC. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax
liability imposed on the Buyer or any of its Affiliates under Announcement 7
shall be an Indemnified Tax.

Section 6.10 Limitations. None of the parties shall make or change any Tax
election that is effective for Tax purposes on or before the Closing Date,
including any Tax election under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 (or
any similar election under applicable state, local, or foreign Law), that is
effective on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
the Buyer or Seller, as applicable (which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) Seller and its Affiliates will prepare and file or will
cause to be prepared and filed all Consolidated Tax Returns and shall pay all
Taxes shown as due thereon to the extent relating to the Transferred Assets or
the Acquired Entities (other than Taxes that are being contested in good faith
through appropriate proceedings), (b) none of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates will be required to provide any Person with any Consolidated Tax
Return or copy of any Consolidated Tax Return, including supporting Tax work
papers, (c) Seller and its Affiliates will have the exclusive right to control
in all respects any Tax claim and any other inquiry, audit, investigation,
assessment or other proceeding with respect to any Consolidated Tax Return and
(d) none of the Buyer or its Affiliates shall initiate any voluntary contact
with any Governmental Authority in matters relating to Taxes of the Seller or
its Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Seller (which shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

Section 6.11 Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer and the Seller shall each
and shall each cause their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of
the Buyer after the Closing, the Acquired Entities), and its and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to cooperate as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims. Such
cooperation will include providing records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such matters, making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explaining any
materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.11. The Buyer and the Acquired
Entities, on the one hand, and the Seller and each of the Seller Entities, on
the other hand, agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Acquired Entities relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date for a period of seven years and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.
The Buyer and the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer
Tax.

Section 6.12 Survival. The provisions of this Article VI shall survive for the
period of the applicable statute of limitations for the assessment and
collection of the underlying Tax (after taking into account any mitigation,
waiver, extension or tolling thereof) plus 60 days.

(the "Indemnifying Party") 

as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by such Indemnified Party of
written notice of the Third Party Claim, describing (to the extent such
information is available to the Indemnified Party) in reasonable detail (i)
the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder, (ii) the
amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim, or if such
information is not then available to the Indemnified Party, a good faith
estimate of the amount of such claim, (iii) each individual item of Loss
included in the amount so stated, to the extent known, (iv) the date such item
was paid or properly accrued and (v) the nature of the breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to which such
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to indemnification hereunder (all of
the foregoing, the "Claim Information"), and shall provide any other
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Party shall retain control following
Closing of the defense (including the right to designate legal counsel) of any
Action pending as of Closing against the Seller and/or its post-closing
Affiliates in connection with the matters described in Section 8.2(c).

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim and subject to the
Indemnifying Party agreeing to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified
Party for such Third Party Claim (subject to the limits set forth in this
Article VIII), to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party; provided, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
for the Indemnified Party, there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party's environmental consultants
or other professional advisors, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party or its environmental consultants or other professional advisors. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of
such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by
its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the
liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, and which releases the
Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim,
provided, that such settlement, compromise or discharge (i) does not impose
any equitable or other non-monetary remedies or obligations on the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates and (ii) does not involve a finding or
admission of wrongdoing or any violation of Law or any violation of the rights
of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim containing the Claim
Information (to the extent such information is available to the Indemnified
Party) as soon as reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Party, and shall
provide any other information with respect thereto as the 

Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise
resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include
providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters (such access to
employees shall be during normal business hours, upon reasonable prior notice,
under the supervision of the Indemnified Party's personnel or designees and in
such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of
the Indemnified Party) and providing other reasonable assistance with respect
to such matters. The failure to provide notice or to follow the procedural
provisions set forth herein, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

(d) The Seller shall have the right, upon written notice to the Buyer, to
assume operational control for the investigation and remediation of or
response to any Seller Environmental Liability only to the extent related to a
Contamination Liability as such term is defined herein, including control over
the defense of and in any proceeding relating to, any related investigation
and remedial measure. The Buyer shall have the right to control all actions
for any Seller Environmental Liability related to an Environmental Compliance
Liability as such term is defined herein, subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 8.4(d) and Section 8.5(b)(vii). The Seller's obligations under
this Article VIII with respect to all Seller Environmental Liabilities shall
be limited to costs and damages reasonably required to comply with
Environmental Laws using cost-effective and commercially reasonable methods to
the extent permitted under Environmental Laws, including where appropriate for
a Contamination Liability, the use of risk assessments, institutional
controls, and deed restrictions consistent with the affected Real Property's
use as an industrial facility and such Environmental Laws, provided, that any
institutional control, deed restriction or any other restriction or limitation
on Real Property that materially affects the Buyer's operations shall be
approved in advance by the Buyer, whose approval will not be unreasonably
withheld. For each Contamination Liability for which Seller has assumed
operational control, the Seller shall provide the Buyer with the opportunity
and a reasonable time period to review in advance and comment on any proposed
remedial action plan or regulatory submission related to any indemnified
matter and such comments shall be incorporated to the extent they are
consistent with Environmental Laws. The Seller shall keep the Buyer apprised
of all material developments, including any delays, in Seller's investigation,
remediation of or response to any Contamination Liability.

(e) In performing its obligations with respect to any Contamination Liability,
the Seller shall indemnify the Buyer and (i) timely complete the environmental
investigation and any response activities, including all cleanup and
monitoring, required under Environmental Law and use its best efforts to
obtain receipt of a no further action letter or other regulatory closure from
the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to the applicable Seller
Environmental Liability ("Regulatory Closure") based upon the applicable Real
Property's current use as an industrial facility, and (ii) ensure that the
completed remedy will not materially and adversely affect the value or
operation of the applicable Real Property in respect of its current uses.

(f) Upon the Seller's reasonable request, the Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with the Seller in connection with
any investigation or remediation of or defense of any Action arising from a
Contamination Liability for which the Seller has assumed operational control,
including by providing reasonable access to the applicable Real Property in
order to investigate or remediate contamination at such Real Property,
provided, that the parties coordinate such access in good faith to accommodate
the reasonable needs of the Buyer's operations. 

Section 8.5 Additional Indemnification Provisions.

(a) The amount of any and all Losses under this Article VIII shall be reduced
by an amount equal to: (i) any Tax benefit actually realized through a
reduction in Taxes otherwise payable in the taxable period of the Loss and the
two following taxable periods by any party seeking indemnification hereunder
arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such
Losses (but increased by an amount equal to any tax imposed because of the
receipt by the Indemnified Party of such indemnity payments) and (ii) any
insurance, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement, contract or other proceeds
that have been recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (less
any costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
recovery of such insurance proceeds and any related increases in insurance
premiums) (each, an "Alternative Recovery"). The Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all such
Alternative Recoveries with respect to any Loss to the same extent as such
Indemnified Party would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. In the event that the
Indemnified Party receives recovery of any amount pursuant to an Alternative
Recovery for which it has already been indemnified by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, the Indemnified Party will as soon as reasonably practicable refund
an equal amount to the Indemnifying Party.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement;

(i) absent Fraud, the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that
may be recovered from the Seller by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) shall be $330 million; provided, that such limitation with
respect to Losses arising out of or resulting from a breach of a Seller
Fundamental Representation shall be $660 million;

(ii) absent Fraud, the Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a), other than
a claim for indemnification arising out of or resulting from a breach of a
Seller Fundamental Representation or a breach of the representation set out in
Section 3.13(f), unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
that may be recovered from the Seller equals or exceeds $20 million (the
"Basket Amount"), in which case the Seller shall be liable for the entire Loss
(not just the Losses in excess of the Basket Amount); provided, however, that
no Losses, other than Losses arising out of or resulting from a breach of a
Seller Fundamental Representation, may be claimed by any Buyer Indemnified
Party or shall be reimbursable by the Seller or shall be included in
calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this clause other than Losses
in excess of $165,000 resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims
arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances;

(iii) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss to the extent that a specific, identifiable
accrual or reserve for the amount of such Loss was reflected in the Financial
Statements;

(iv) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss to the extent that the Buyer received a benefit
from the reflection of such matter in the calculation of the adjustment of the
Purchase Price, if any, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9;

(v) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including business interruption, diminution of value, loss of future
revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or 

opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, except
to the extent payable to a third party;

(vi) in determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder
has occurred, or calculating the amount of Losses indemnifiable hereunder, any
qualifications as to materiality (including the word "material"), "Material
Adverse Effect", or other similar materiality qualifications included in any
representation or warranty hereunder shall be disregarded;

(vii) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss to the extent arising out of or resulting from
a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 3.15 or a Seller
Environmental Liability if and to the extent that such Loss arises out of or
results from:

(A) a change in the use of any Real Property from use as an industrial
manufacturing facility to a nonindustrial use, as such use is classified under
the Environmental Laws applicable to the relevant Real Property;

(B) any invasive investigations, sampling or monitoring of any Real Property
from and after Closing (including "Phase 2" soil and groundwater testing)
unless (i) required by Environmental Law, an Environmental Permit, a
Governmental Authority, or an order, judgment or an arbitral award pursuant to
Environmental Laws; (ii) reasonably necessary to investigate or abate an
imminent hazard as defined by Environmental Law; (iii) reasonably necessary to
respond to a third-party claim if such invasive investigation, sampling or
monitoring is recommended by a licensed environmental consultant based upon
prior sampling that indicates a release has occurred on the Real Property in
question; (iv) conducted as part of a bona fide construction, demolition, de-
commissioning, closure or necessary repair of subsurface utilities or
features, in all cases, if soil or groundwater testing is required pursuant to
any Environmental Law in connection with such activity or required to
characterize and dispose of Hazardous Substances offsite; or (v) required by
the terms of an applicable lease;

(C) the new release of Hazardous Substances by any Person unrelated to the
Seller or its Affiliates after Closing, provided, that the migration or
degradation of Hazardous Substances existing on, under or about the Real
Property as of the Closing Date shall not be considered a new release; and

(D) passage of, or any change in, any Law after the Closing Date; provided,
that if a claim relates to non-compliance with Environmental Laws on or prior
to the Closing Date, the remediation shall be measured relative to compliance
with Environmental Laws at the time of the remediation, even if such
Environmental Law may have changed since the Closing Date.

(viii) upon receipt of Regulatory Closure at any Real Property, the Seller
shall have no further obligation or responsibility under this Agreement with
respect to related Seller Environmental Liabilities unless a Governmental
Authority subsequently requires additional remediation due to contamination at
the applicable Real Property which predates Closing.

Section 8.6 Tax Matters. Anything in this Article VIII to the contrary
notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters and the conduct of any Tax Contest
shall be governed by Article VI; provided, however, that the provisions of
Section 8.5(b)(vi) shall apply in determining whether there has been a breach
of a representation or warranty contained in Section 3.14 or, to the extent
related to Taxes, Section 3.9. 

Section 8.7 Assignment of Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses and the
Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a
third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted
against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnifying Party's direction and expense, take all reasonable actions to
seek to recover such claim from such Potential Contributor. Any payment
received in respect of such claim against the Potential Contributor (whether
by the Indemnifying Party or the relevant Indemnified Party as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence) shall be distributed, (a) first, to the
Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount required
to be paid by the Indemnified Party prior to the Indemnifying Party being
required to make any payment to the Indemnified Party plus, in the case of any
claim by a Indemnified Party as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting,
defending or otherwise addressing such claim, (b) second, to the Indemnifying
Party in an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, plus the costs and
expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise
addressing such claim and (c) the balance, if any, to the Indemnified Party.

Section 8.8 Exclusivity of Remedies.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement or in the case of Fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, each
party hereto, on behalf of itself and the other Indemnified Parties, waives
any rights and claims any Indemnified Party may have against the other party,
any of its Affiliates, and any of its or their respective Representatives
(collectively, "Released Parties"), regardless of the Law or legal theory
under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
at law, in equity, contract, tort or otherwise, relating to the Business
and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. The rights and claims waived by each party on behalf of itself and
the other Indemnified Parties, include, without limitation, to the fullest
extent permitted under Law, claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any Law (including, inter alia, any
Environmental Law), claims for breach of contract, for breach (negligent or
otherwise) of representation or warranty, and claims for breach of duty. After
the Closing, this Article VIII will provide the exclusive remedy against any
of the Released Parties for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other claims arising out of or relating to (directly or
indirectly) this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than with respect to remedies against the Released Parties in cases involving
Fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement.

(b) The parties agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on the remedies with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby were specifically bargained
for between sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in
the determination of the amounts to be paid to the Seller hereunder.

Section 8.9 No Right of Set-Off. The Buyer for itself and for the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and their successors and assigns hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or
similar rights that the Buyer or any of such Persons has or may have with
respect to any other payments to be made by the Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other document or instrument
delivered by the Buyer in connection herewith.

Section 8.10 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Following the Closing, any
payment made pursuant to Article VI or this Article VIII shall be treated by
the parties, to the extent permitted by Law, for 

federal income Tax and other applicable Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the
cash proceeds received by the Seller in the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

(b) by the Seller, if the Seller is not then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement such that such failure or breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.3 and the Buyer breaches or fails to perform
in any respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (i) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, (ii) cannot
be or has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) 30
days following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
and (iii) has not been waived by the Seller;

(c) by the Buyer, if the Buyer is not then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement such that such failure or breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.2 and the Seller breaches or fails to perform
in any respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (i) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3, (ii) cannot
be or has not been cured by the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) 30
days following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
and (iii) has not been waived by the Buyer;

(d) by either the Seller or the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred
by 5:00 pm Eastern Time on the Termination Date; provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available if
the failure of the party so requesting termination to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date. The "Termination Date" shall
be July 21, 2021 (the "Initial Termination Date"); provided, that (i) if on
the Initial Termination Date, all the conditions to Closing, other than the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b), shall have been
satisfied or waived (or, in the case of any conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied), then the
Initial Termination Date may be extended by the Buyer to October 21, 2021 (the
"First Extended Termination Date") upon written notice by the Buyer to the
Seller no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time on July 16, 2021, and (ii) if on the
First Extended Termination Date all the conditions to Closing, other than the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b), shall have been
satisfied or waived (or, in the case of any conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of being satisfied), then the
First Extended Termination Date may be extended by the Buyer to January 21,
2022 (the "Second Extended Termination Date") upon written notice by the Buyer
to the Seller no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time on October 18, 2021. As used
in this Agreement, the term "Termination Date" shall mean the Initial
Termination Date, unless the Initial Termination Date has been extended to the
First Extended Termination Date or Second Extended Termination Date pursuant
to the foregoing, in which case, the term "Termination Date" shall mean the
date to which the Termination Date has been extended, as applicable; or

(e) by either the Seller or the Buyer in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have 

become final and nonappealable; provided, that the party so requesting
termination shall have complied with Section 5.9 and provided, further, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of or failure to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, such order, decree, ruling or other action.

Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1 (other than
Section 9.1(a)) shall be effected by delivery of written notice of such
termination by the terminating party to the other party.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party except (a)
for the provisions of Section 3.19 and Section 4.5 relating to broker's fees
and finder's fees, Section 5.8 relating to confidentiality, Section 5.15
relating to public announcements, this Section 9.2 and Article X and (b) that
nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for Fraud in the
making of its respective representations and warranties expressly set forth in
this Agreement or for any Willful Breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other Disclosure Schedule as
though fully set forth in such Disclosure Schedule for which applicability of

Crutcher LLP and Jones Day, (the "Firms") have acted as counsel for the Seller
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Acquisition Engagement"), and in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Firms have not acted as counsel for any
other Person, including the Buyer.

(b) Only the Seller and its Affiliates shall be considered clients of the
Firms in the Acquisition Engagement. The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) acknowledges
and agrees that all confidential communications between the Seller and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Firms, on the other hand, in the course
of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection, and expectation of client confidentiality
applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong solely to the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), and not the Acquired Entities,
and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by the Buyer or the
Acquired Entities upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, the Buyer shall not
have access to any such communications, or to the files of the Firms relating
to the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to
the extent that files of the Firms in respect of the Acquisition Engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Seller and its Affiliates shall
hold such property rights and (ii) the Firms shall not have any duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to the Acquired Entities or the Buyer by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between the Firms and the Acquired Entities or otherwise;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Firms shall not
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any third parties
(other than representatives, accountants and advisors of the Seller and its
Affiliates; provided, that such representatives, accounts and advisors are
instructed to maintain the confidence of such attorney-client communications).
The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Acquired Entities) irrevocably waives any right it may have to
discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the Acquisition
Engagement, to the extent that such information or documentation was subject
to an attorney-client privilege, work product protection or other expectation
of confidentiality owed to the Seller and/or its Affiliates. If and to the
extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) shall have the
right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any 

communication between the Acquired Entities or their Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, the Buyer,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Acquired Entities) shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with the
prior written consent of the Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld).

(c) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Acquired Entities) acknowledges and agrees that the Firms have
acted as counsel for the Seller and its Affiliates and that the Seller
reasonably anticipates that the Firms will continue to represent it and/or its
Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) expressly
(i) consents to the Firms' representation of the Seller and/or its Affiliates
and/or any of their respective agents (if any of the foregoing Persons so
desire) in any matter, including, without limitation, any post-Closing matter
in which the interests of the Buyer and the Acquired Entities, on the one
hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse,
including any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and whether or not such matter is one in which the Firms may have
previously advised the Seller, the Acquired Entities or their respective
Affiliates and (ii) consents to the disclosure by the Firms to the Seller or
its Affiliates of any information learned by the Firms in the course of their
representation of the Seller, the Acquired Entities or their respective
Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, or the Firms' duty of
confidentiality.

(d) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Acquired Entities) further covenants and agrees that each shall
not assert any claim against the Firms in respect of legal services provided
to the Acquired Entities or their respective Affiliates by the Firms in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) From and after the Closing, the Acquired Entities shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with the Firms, unless and to the extent the
Firms are expressly engaged in writing by any of the Acquired Entities to
represent any or all of the Acquired Entities after the Closing and either (i)
such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Seller
and/or any of its Affiliates or (ii) the Seller and/or any such Affiliate, as
applicable, consent in writing to such engagement. Any such representation of
any of the Acquired Entities by the Firms after the Closing shall not affect
the foregoing provisions hereof. Furthermore, each of the Firms, in their
respective sole discretion, shall be permitted to withdraw from representing
the Acquired Entities and their Affiliates in order to represent or continue
so representing the Seller.

(f) The Seller and the Buyer consent to the arrangements in this Section 10.19
and waive any actual or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in
connection with any representation by the Firms permitted hereunder.

Section 10.20 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates
and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.21 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of the Buyer and the
Seller acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by
legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of Law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived. 

Section 10.22 Prevailing Party. If there shall occur any dispute or proceeding
among the parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of the prevailing party.

Section 10.23 Translation of Currencies. In the event that the parties need to
convert non-U.S. currencies to U.S. currency under this Agreement, the
relevant exchange rate shall be determined based on the rate in effect as of
