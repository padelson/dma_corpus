Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Company Board of Directors after the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the Company Board of Directors or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (as amended, the " _Company Certificate_ "), the Bylaws of the Company (as amended, the " _Company Bylaws_ ", and together with the Company Certificate, the " _Company Governing Documents_ ") or applicable law) be required (i) for the Company to amend or terminate this Agreement; (ii) to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, if such action would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser); (iii) to amend the Company Governing Documents if such action would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser); or (iv) to take any other action of the Company Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser). Subject to the foregoing, in no event shall the requirement to have Continuing Directors as provided above result in Persons elected or designated by Purchaser constituting less than a majority of the directors on the board of directors of the Company unless Parent shall have failed to designate a sufficient number of persons to constitute at least a majority.

Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Section 2.2, without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time   ##### 

  

  

  

shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the first anniversary after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Merger Consideration or Offer Price otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof; _provided_ , however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 Section 2.3. _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and   ##### 

  

  

  

shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ ,
however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under the Appraisal Rights, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) The Company shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of any demands or withdrawals of such demands received by the Company for dissenters rights of any Shares, and Purchaser shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) to pay for the Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 (a) Each outstanding option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and shall be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share for such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised, whether or not then vested or exercisable. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section 2.4(a) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within three Business Days following the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 to any holder of Company Stock Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

 (b) Each outstanding Company Warrant, whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and shall be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share for such Company Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Company Warrant shall not theretofore have been exercised, whether or not then vested or exercisable. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.5 to any holder of Company Warrants such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding.

 (i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit Plans and Company Foreign Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of the Company or Parent from amending or terminating such plans, arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Person who is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time other than such employees covered by collective bargaining agreements (" _Company Employees_ ") at least the same compensation (salary, wages and incentive compensation, but excluding any equity compensation plans) provided to Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide Company Employees whose employment terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits that are at least as favorable as the levels and pursuant to the terms of the Companys severance policies (as set forth in Section 5.6(a)(i) of the Companys Disclosure Letter) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (ii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time as required pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

    

this 5.6(a) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent
as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which
such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by such plans, (A) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is similar in type to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the similar plans of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to
be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Employees shall remain covered by the Old Plans which provide medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits until December 31,
2007. In addition, until December 31, 2007 Parent agrees to continue or cause
the Surviving Corporation to continue the Companys retiree welfare programs
for the benefit of eligible former employees on the same terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.6(a)(ii) shall be construed to create
any right of continued employment with Parent, the Company or
any subsidiary. 

  

 (iii) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), unless the Parent provides written notice to the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Time that such 401(k) plans need not be terminated. Unless the Parent provides such written notice to the Company, the Company shall provide the Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to reasonable review and approval of the Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan(s) as the Parent may reasonably require. As of the Effective Time, all Company Employees eligible to participate in any such Company 401(k) Plan(s) shall be eligible to participate in a Code Section 401(k) arrangement maintained by the Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). The Parent shall cause such 

   ##### 

  

    

Parent 401(k) Plan to accept direct rollover contributions (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in respect of Company Employees,
including any outstanding participant loans and related promissory notes. 

  

 (iv) On or before the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the TB Woods Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") and any cash balance in participants accounts shall be returned to such participants as soon as administratively practicable, as described in Article IX of the ESPP. 

  

 Section 5.7. _Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or to cause to be done, and to assist and to cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , however, that in no event shall the Company be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties or other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any Contract. 

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than 10 days after the date hereof, file any and all Notification and Report Forms required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") with respect to the Transactions, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; (ii) if required, promptly make an appropriate filing under the European Community Merger Regulation, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a decision from the European Commission allowing the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings and timely obtaining all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals; (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable any additional information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Regulatory Law or by such Governmental Entity; and (v) use 

   ##### 

  

    

commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under Regulatory Law with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of material or significant notices or other material or significant communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written material communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any significant substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. 

  

 (d) Subject to and in furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 5.7, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.7 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section 5.7. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on its business, and nothing in this Section 5.7 shall (i) require Parent to offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose or hold separate any part of its or the Companys businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or a combination of Parents and the Companys respective businesses, operations, assets or product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business, and/or (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may carry on business in any 

   ##### 

  

    

part of the world, unless Parent determines, in its sole reasonable judgment,
that such action would not have more than a de minimis adverse impact on the
strategic and other benefits expected to be achieved from the Merger and
would not have more than a de minimis adverse impact on Parent or
the Company. 

  

 Section 5.8. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent and the Company. 

  

 Section 5.9. _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents or in any indemnification agreement set forth in Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries set forth in Schedule 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action (as hereinafter defined) pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred before the Effective Time, including 

   ##### 

  

    

acts or omissions in connection with such person serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request
or for the benefit of the Company. An Indemnified Party shall notify the
Surviving Corporation in writing promptly upon learning of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding, investigation or other matter in respect of which such
indemnification may be sought. The Surviving Corporation shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to assume and control the defense of,
including the investigation of, and corrective action required to be
undertaken in response to, any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to
any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.9 with counsel
reasonably selected by it; _provided_ , however, that the Indemnified Party
shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such claim with counsel
of his choosing, the reasonable expense of which shall be borne by the
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be liable for any settlement or compromise
effected without its written consent. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase, and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, a fully pre-paid six-year "tail" policy to the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the " _Current Policy_ "), which tail policy shall cover a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain the same coverage (including, without limitation, the scope and amount thereof) as, and contain terms and conditions that are equivalent to, the coverage set forth in the Current Policy; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company expend per year of coverage more than three hundred percent (300%) of the amount currently expended by the Company per year of coverage as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") to procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto. If the Company is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this paragraph, the Company shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount. The Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement set forth in Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter or the DGCL. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) In the event the Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. The 

   ##### 

  

    

agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive
of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights
to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior
to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 

  

 Section 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The parties hereto shall give prompt notice to each other of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent; (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in (i) any of the Conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement, (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.19 to be untrue or incorrect in a material respect, (iii) except as has not had and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, any of the representations and warranties (other than those referenced in clause (ii) of this paragraph) being untrue or incorrect in any respect and (iv) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, as the case may be; _provided_ , however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement, (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice or (z) otherwise affect the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth in Article VI. 

  

 Section 5.11. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 5.12. _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.13. _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of stockholders of the Company. 

  

 Section 5.14. _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 Section 5.16. _FIRPTA_. Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company shall provide to Purchaser a certificate complying with Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(g)(1)(ii) that states that interests in the Company are not "United States real property interests". 

  

ARTICLE VI

 (ii) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company duly authorized by the Company Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board of Directors_ "), or authorized committee thereof.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Termination Fee_.

 (iii) If (A) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(i)(A) as a result of a breach of a covenant or agreement of the Company under this Agreement or an intentional breach of a representation or warranty of the Company under this Agreement; (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the breach forming the basis for such termination, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a continuation or renewal of, or otherwise relating to, an Acquisition Proposal that was known to the Company prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement) is known to the Company; and (C) concurrently with, or within twelve (12) months following such termination, an Acquisition Transaction occurs, then, the Company shall pay to Parent promptly, but in no event later than the date of consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, the Termination Fee. 

  

 (c) The Termination Fee shall be paid promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall not withhold any withholding taxes on any payment under this Section 7.2. 

  

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that without such provisions, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee and Parent or Purchaser commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay Parent and Purchaser their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section 7.2(b) hereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 (e) The payment of the Termination Fee provided under this Section 7.2 is the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Purchaser against the Company with respect to the termination of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (except with respect to any wilful material breach of this Agreement).
