holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser); or (iv)&nbsp;to take any other action of the Company
Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement if such action
would materially and adversely affect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or Purchaser).
Subject to the foregoing, in no event shall the requirement to have Continuing Directors as
provided above result in Persons elected or designated by Purchaser constituting less than a
majority of the directors on the board of directors of the Company unless Parent shall have failed
to designate a sufficient number of persons to constitute at least a majority.

the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall

instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger

other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so

a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be

Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent.

or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1 hereof; <U>provided</U>,
however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver
a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the

requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power or
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as

delay or materially impede the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (a &#147;<U>Parent Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148;). The
organizational or governing documents of Parent and Purchaser, as previously provided to the
