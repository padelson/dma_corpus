Section 6.10(c) hereof, and (iv) distribute to the Parent an amount
of Escrowed Property equal to the amount by which Louisville Net Operating
Losses exceed the proceeds of the sale of the Louisville Station and have not
been reimbursed to the Parent by the Series A Stockholders and the Series
B Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.6(f) or Section 6.10(c) hereof, and,
provided further, that any such additional Escrowed Property retained
pursuant to the preceding provisos shall be promptly distributed to the
Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders on a pro-rata or
individual basis, as applicable, after such pending Indemnification Claims
are satisfied or resolved;   (e) if after the Closing (i) the Parent is
entitled to receive indemnification in accordance with Section 8.2(d) hereof
with respect to the sale of the Lexington Stations (a "Lexington
Indemnification Claim") or (ii) the Lexington Net Operating Losses exceed the
net cash proceeds from the sale of the Lexington Stations and have not been
reimbursed to the Parent by the Series A Stockholders and the Series B
Stockholders pursuant to Section 6.10(c) hereof, then the Parent shall be
entitled to withdraw an amount of the Lexington Escrowed Cash equal to the
amount of such Lexington Indemnification Claim or the amount by which
Lexington Net Operating Losses exceed the net cash proceeds of the sale of
the Lexington Stations and have not been reimbursed to the Parent by the
Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders, as the case may be.
On the expiration of the indemnification period under the Lexington Contract
or any other contract for the sale of the Lexington Stations, the Escrow
Agent shall release to the Series A Stockholders and the Series B
Stockholders, on a pro rata basis less any deductions noted below, the
Lexington Escrowed Cash remaining after the permitted withdrawals hereunder,
provided that the Parent, the Series A Stockholders Representative and the
Series B Stockholders\' Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent
to (A) retain an amount of the Lexington Escrowed Cash equal to the amount
necessary to satisfy any pending Lexington Indemnification Claims made under
Section 8.2(d), and (B) distribute to the Parent an amount equal to the
amount by which Lexington Net Operating Losses   -21-   exceed the net
cash proceeds of the sale of the Lexington Stations and have not been
reimbursed to the Parent by the Series A Stockholders and the Series
B Stockholders pursuant to Section 6.10(c) hereof or previously withdrawn
from the Lexington Escrowed Cash, and, provided further, that any such
additional Lexington Escrowed Cash retained pursuant to the preceding
provisos shall be promptly distributed to the Series A Stockholders and the
Series B Stockholders on a pro-rata basis after such pending Lexington
Indemnification Claims are satisfied or resolved; and   (f) if after the
Closing (i) the Parent is entitled to receive indemnification in accordance
with Section 8.2(d) hereof with respect to the sale of the Louisville Station
(a "Louisville Indemnification Claim") or (ii) the Louisville Net Operating
Losses exceed the net cash proceeds from the sale of the Louisville Station
and have not been reimbursed to the Parent by the Series A Stockholders and
the Series B Stockholders pursuant to Section 6.10(c) hereof, then the Parent
shall be entitled to withdraw an amount of the Louisville Escrowed Cash equal
to the amount of such Louisville Indemnification Claim or the amount by which
Louisville Net Operating Losses exceed the net cash proceeds of the sale of
the Louisville Station and have not been reimbursed to the Parent by the
Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders, as the case may be. On
the expiration of the indemnification period under the Louisville Contract or
any other contract for the sale of the Louisville Station, the Escrow Agent
shall release to the Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders, on
a pro rata basis less any deductions noted below, the Louisville Escrowed
Cash remaining after the permitted withdrawals hereunder, provided that the
Parent, the Series A Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B
Stockholders\' Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to (A)
retain an amount of the Louisville Escrowed Cash equal to the
amount necessary to satisfy any pending Louisville Indemnification Claims
made under Section 8.2(d), and (B) distribute to the Parent an amount equal
to the amount by which Louisville Net Operating Losses exceed the net cash
proceeds of the sale of the Louisville Station and have not been reimbursed
to the Parent by the Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders
pursuant to Section 6.10(c) hereof or previously withdrawn from the Lexington
Escrowed Cash, and, provided further, that any such additional Louisville
Escrowed Cash retained pursuant to the preceding provisos shall be promptly
distributed to the Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders on a
pro-rata basis after such pending Louisville Indemnification Claims are
satisfied or resolved.   If applicable, Escrowed Property withdrawn or
retained by the Parent pursuant to Sections 2.6(a), 2.6(b), 2.6(c) or 2.6(d)
hereof shall consist of portions of Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Stock in the
same ratio as the Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Stock bear to each other, with
the value of each Parent Class D Share comprising such Escrowed Stock being
deemed to be the Applicable Class D Value for purposes of such determination;
provided, however, that Escrowed Property so withdrawn or retained with
respect to Indemnification Claims made under Sections 8.2(b) or 8.2(c) hereof
shall consist of portions of Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Stock in the same
ratio as would be distributable to the applicable Stockholder pursuant to the
following sentence. Escrowed Property distributed to the Stockholders
pursuant to Sections 2.6(c) and 2.6(d) hereof shall consist of portions of
Escrowed Cash and Escrowed Stock determined as follows: (1) Escrowed Cash and
Escrowed Stock shall be distributed to Series A Stockholders in the same
ratio as the Escrowed Series A Cash Merger Consideration and Escrowed Series
A Stock Consideration bear to each other; and (2) Escrowed Cash and Escrowed
Stock shall be distributed to Series B Stockholders in the same ratio as the
Escrowed Series B Cash Merger Consideration and the Escrowed Series B Stock
Merger Consideration bear to each other, in each case with the value  
-22-   of each Parent Class D Share comprising such Escrowed Stock being
deemed to be the Applicable Class D Value for such purposes. For the
avoidance of doubt (i) the Escrowed Cash deposited into the post-Closing
escrow pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall consist of cash in an amount equal
to the Escrowed Series A Cash Consideration withheld from the Aggregate
Series A Cash Consideration, and cash in an amount equal to the Escrowed
Series B Cash Consideration withheld from the Aggregate Series B Cash
Consideration, (ii) the Escrowed Stock deposited into the post-Closing escrow
pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall consist of a number of Parent Class D
Shares equal to the Escrowed Series A Stock Merger Consideration which shall
be withheld from the Aggregate Series A Stock Merger Consideration, and a
number of Parent Class D Shares equal to the Escrowed Series B Stock Merger
Consideration which shall be withheld from the Aggregate Series B Stock
Merger Consideration, and (iii) no portion of the Aggregate Series D Stock
Merger Consideration or Aggregate Series D Cash Merger Consideration shall be
deposited into the post-Closing escrow, and no Series D Stockholder shall
have any rights with respect to the Escrowed Property.   (g) As of the
Effective Time, the Series A Stockholders shall have the right to modify the
Escrowed Series A Stock Merger Consideration and the Escrowed Series A Cash
Merger Consideration as follows: (i) the Series A Stockholders shall have the
right to reduce the amount of the Escrowed Series A Cash Merger Consideration
by directing the Parent to increase the Parent Class D Shares that will
constitute the Escrowed Series A Merger Consideration by that number of
shares equal to the amount of the desired cash reduction divided by the
Applicable Class D Value; and/or (ii) the Series A Stockholders shall have
the right to deliver, in lieu of any or all Parent Class D Shares that would
constitute the Escrowed Series A Stock Merger Consideration, a sum of
immediately available funds equal to the Applicable Class D Value multiplied
by the number of Parent Class D Shares being substituted as set forth in
Section 2(c) of the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement. Any and all Parent Class
D Shares so substituted shall be distributed immediately to the
Stockholder(s) who elect to deliver cash pursuant to this Section 2.6(g). The
Parties agree that, notwithstanding any modifications to the post-Closing
escrow pursuant to this Section 2.6(g), the aggregate value of the cash and
the Parent Class D Shares (valued at the Applicable Class D Value) deposited
into the post-Closing escrow at the Effective Time shall be Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000.00).   2.7. The Merger Consideration Adjustment.   (a)
Not later than five (5) business days before Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Parent a statement (the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement")
that sets forth a good faith estimate of the amount of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital and the Consolidated Liabilities (including the unpaid
Transaction Fees and Costs) at Closing and the Company\'s calculation of the
Adjusted Consideration and Merger Consideration for each Stockholder.
The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall show the Company\'s calculations
in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by a good faith, estimated
balance sheet of the Company (as of the date of the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement) prepared by the Company Accountant in accordance with GAAP and
other supporting documentation.    (b) Not later than 90 days after
Closing, the Parent shall deliver to the Series A Stockholders\'
Representative and the Series B Stockholders\' Representative a statement
(the "Final Adjustment Statement") that sets forth the amount of the Closing
Date Net Working   -23-   Capital and the Consolidated Liabilities at
Closing and the Parent\'s calculation of the Adjusted Consideration and the
Merger Consideration for each Stockholder. The Final Adjustment Statement
shall show the Parent\'s calculations in reasonable detail and shall be
accompanied by a balance sheet of the Company (as of the Closing Date)
prepared by the Parent\'s Accountant in accordance with GAAP and other
supporting documentation and shall explain in reasonable detail
any differences between the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
Final Adjustment Statement.   (c) If the Series A Stockholders\'
Representative or the Series B Stockholders\' Representative disputes any
item in the Final Adjustment Statement, such Stockholders\' Representative
shall notify the Parent in writing thereof (specifying the amount of each
item in dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each
item in dispute) within fifteen (15) business days of receipt by such
Stockholders\' Representative of the Final Adjustment Statement. If the
Series A Stockholders\' Representative or the Series B Stockholders\'
Representative does not notify the Parent of any such dispute within such
time, then the Final Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to be final and
binding on the parties. In the event of such a dispute, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to attempt to reconcile their differences. If
such dispute has not been resolved within twenty (20) business days, the
parties shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, as promptly as practicable but in
any event within twenty (20) business days, resolve the disputed items and
report to the parties, and such report shall have the effect of an arbitral
award and shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated equally
between the Parent and the Series A Stockholders and the Series B
Stockholders.   (d) If the Merger Consideration as determined in accordance
with this Section 2.7 differs from the amount calculated at the Effective
Time, then within five (5) business days of such determination, the parties
shall make appropriate settlement thereof. If such settlement is in favor of
the Stockholders, the Parent shall promptly deliver additional Parent Class D
Shares to the Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders, on a pro
rata basis, in an amount equal to such settlement, or in the Parent\'s
sole discretion, the Parent may pay all or a portion of such settlement in
cash up to such amount as will not, when aggregated with the Aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration paid at Closing, exceed Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000.00); provided, however, that the aggregate amount of cash paid
at Closing and pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall in all events be less than
the amount that would cause the Merger not to qualify as a reorganization
under (S)368(a) of the Code as determined in the reasonable opinion of
Graydon, Head and Ritchey LLP ; and, further provided, however, that if the
Parent pays such amount in a combination of cash and stock, then the cash
portion shall be delivered first to the Series B Stockholders until either
(i) the amount payable to the Series B Stockholders is satisfied in full, in
which case any remaining cash and all of the stock shall then be delivered to
the Series A Stockholders, or (ii) no cash remains, in which case the balance
of the amount payable to the Series B Stockholders shall be paid in stock and
the amount payable to the Series A Stockholders shall be payable entirely in
stock. In any such settlement, the number of Parent Class D Shares subject to
settlement shall be determined by dividing the amount of the settlement by
the Applicable Class D Value. If such settlement is in favor of the Parent,
the Parent shall be entitled to withdraw such settlement amount from the
Escrowed Property as provided in Section 2.6 hereof; provided that within
fourteen (14) days of such settlement, each Series A Stockholder and Series B
Stockholder shall be required to deliver to the Escrow Agent an amount  
-24-   equal to that Stockholder\'s pro rata share of the amount of
Escrowed Property withdrawn by the Parent in connection with such
settlement.   2.8. Payment of Liabilities. Simultaneously with Closing
on the Closing Date, the Blue Chip Companies long term indebtedness payable
to Fleet and Blue Chip Venture and all other Blue Chip Companies\'
financial institutions and banks, the Transaction Fees and Costs and that
portion of the Employee Award Payments that become payable on the Closing
Date, shall be paid and satisfied by the Parent and in connection with such
satisfactions, the Company shall cause the Blue Chip Companies\' lenders to
release and discharge any and all security interests, stock pledges,
mortgage, liens, claims and encumbrances whatsoever that they may have or
possess against and in respect of the Blue Chip Companies\' assets,
including, without limitation, the execution, delivery and filing of mortgage
satisfactions and UCC termination statements in all required
jurisdictions.   2.9. Company Options. The Company shall take all
actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, upon the Effective Time,
each outstanding option and related rights to purchase Company Shares or
other similar interest (collectively, the "Company Options") granted under
any of the Company\'s stock option plans or under any other plan or
arrangement, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and
all rights of all optionees thereunder shall be terminated.   3.

significant portion of the Company\'s business assets in a business. The
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will each pay its own expenses incurred
in connection with the Merger.   (h) Qualification. The Parent is legally,
financially and otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, acquire, own and
operate the Blue Chip Stations under the Communications Act and the rules and
regulations of the FCC. There are no facts that would, under existing law and
the existing rules and regulations of the FCC, disqualify the Parent as an
assignee of the FCC Licenses or as the owner and operator of the Blue Chip
Stations. No waiver of any FCC rule on behalf of the Parent is necessary for
the FCC Consent to be obtained. There is no action, suit or proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, threatened against the Parent
which questions the legality or propriety of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or could materially adversely affect the Parent\'s ability to
perform its obligations hereunder, other than rule- making proceedings
affecting the broadcasting industry in general. The Parent will have
available on the Closing Date sufficient consideration to enable it to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   (i) Reports and Financial

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) did not
contain any untrue statement of a   -29-   material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided that the foregoing clause (B) shall not apply to the
financial statements included in the Parent SEC Reports (which are covered by
the following sentence). The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included in the Parent
SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the periods or as of the dates then ended (subject,

filed all material reports, registration statements and other filings
required to be filed by it with the SEC under the rules and regulations of

liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent
or otherwise, of a type required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet except (a) liabilities or obligations reflected in any of the
Parent SEC Reports and (b) liabilities or obligations which would not in the
aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent.   (k) No Violation
of Law. The business of the Parent is not being conducted in violation of any
law, ordinance or regulation of any governmental body or authority except (a)
as described in any of the Parent SEC Reports and (b) for violations or
possible violations which would not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Parent.   (l) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Other
than as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, since September 30, 2000, the
business of the Parent has been conducted in all material respects in the
ordinary course and there has not been any event, occurrence, development or
set of circumstances or facts that has had a Material Adverse Effect on the
Parent.   (m) Investigations; Litigation. Except as described in any of the
Parent SEC Reports or previously disclosed in writing to the Company:   (i)
no investigation or review by any  governmental body or authority with
respect to the Parent which would  in the aggregate have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Parent is  pending nor has any governmental body or authority
notified the Parent  of an intention to conduct the same; and   (ii) there
are no actions, suits or proceedings  pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Parent, threatened against or  affecting Parent, or any of its respective
properties, or before any  federal, state, local or foreign governmental body

general applicability), and there is not now issued or outstanding, or
pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened, by or before the FCC,
any order to show cause, notice of violation, notice of apparent liability or
notice of forfeiture. To the Company\'s Knowledge, there is not now before
the FCC any pending or threatened complaint, or other adverse or potentially
adverse action against the Blue Chip Companies or the Blue Chip Stations.  
-41-    (b) All material reports and filings required to be filed with,
and all regulatory fees required to be paid to, the FCC by the Blue Chip
Companies with respect to the Blue Chip Stations have been timely filed
and paid, and all such reports and filings are accurate and complete in all
material respects. The Blue Chip Companies maintain public files for the Blue
Chip Stations which are in material compliance with FCC rules. With respect
to FCC licenses, permits and authorizations, the Blue Chip Companies are
operating only those facilities for which an appropriate FCC Authorization
has been obtained and is in effect, and the Blue Chip Companies are meeting
all of the material conditions of each such FCC Authorization. The Blue Chip
Stations are operating in compliance in all material respects with the FCC
Authorizations, the Communications Act, and the rules, regulations and
policies of the FCC.   (c) The Company is not aware of any facts
indicating that the Stockholders, the Blue Chip Companies or the Blue Chip
Stations are not in compliance with all rules, regulations, policies, and
other requirements of the FCC, the Communications Act, or any other
applicable federal, state and local statutes, regulations and ordinances. The
Company is not aware of any facts and the Company has received no notice or
communication, formal or informal, indicating that the FCC is considering
revoking, suspending, canceling, rescinding or terminating any FCC
Authorization.   (d) The operation of the Blue Chip Stations does not cause
or result in exposure of workers or the general public to levels of
radio frequency radiation in excess of the "Radio Frequency Protection
Guides" recommended in "American National Standard Safety Levels with Respect
to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields 3 kHz to 300 GHz"
(ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992) issued by the American National Standards Institute,
adopted by the FCC effective October 15, 1997, and described in OET Bulletin
No. 65. Renewal of the FCC Authorizations would not constitute a "major
action" within the meaning of (S)1.1301, et seq., of the FCC\'s rules.  
(e) Each communications tower structure used in the operation of the Blue
Chip Stations has (to the Company\'s Knowledge with respect to leased
communications tower structures) been registered under the rules
and regulations of the FCC, and the Federal Aviation Administration has
issued a determination of no hazard to air navigation with respect to each
such tower for which such a determination is required.   4.16. Notes and
Accounts Receivable. All notes and accounts receivable of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are reflected properly on their books and records, are valid
receivables subject to no setoffs or counterclaims, are current and
collectible, and will be collected in accordance with their terms at their
recorded amounts, subject only to the reserve for bad debts set forth on the
face of the Most Recent Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) as
adjusted for operations and transactions through the Closing Date
in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.   4.17 Powers of Attorney. To the Company\'s Knowledge,
there are no material outstanding powers of attorney executed on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.   -42-    4.18. Insurance. Section
4.18 of the Disclosure Schedule lists each material insurance policy
(including policies providing property, casualty, liability, and workers\'
compensation coverage and bond and surety arrangements) with respect to which
any of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a party. Section 4.18 of the
Disclosure Schedule describes any material self-insurance arrangements
affecting the Company and its Subsidiaries. With respect to each such
insurance policy: (i) the policy is legal, valid, binding, enforceable,
and in full force and effect in all material respects; (ii) neither the
Company and its Subsidiaries nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any other
party to the policy is in material breach or default (including with respect
to the payment of premiums or the giving of notices), and no event has
occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
material breach or default, or permit termination, modification, or
acceleration, under the policy; and (iii) no party to the policy has
repudiated any material provision thereof.   4.19. Litigation. Section 4.19
of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each instance in which any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (a) is subject to any outstanding injunction,
judgment, order, decree, ruling, or charge or (b) is a party or, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, or investigation of, in, or before any court or quasi-
judicial or administrative agency of any federal, state, local, or foreign
jurisdiction or before any arbitrator.   4.20. Employees. To the Company\'s
Knowledge, no executive, key employee, or significant group of employees
plans to terminate employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries during
the next 12 months. Neither the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any collective bargaining agreement, nor has any of them experienced
any strike or material grievance, claim of unfair labor practices, or other
collective bargaining dispute within the past three years. Neither the
Company or its Subsidiaries has committed any material unfair labor practice.
To the Company\'s Knowledge, there is no organizational effort presently
being made or threatened by or on behalf of any labor union with respect to
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has delivered to
the Parent a true and correct copy of all written policies of any of the Blue
Chip Companies provided to employees of any of the Blue Chip Companies.  
4.21. Employee Benefits.   (a) Section 4.21 of the Disclosure Schedule lists
each Employee Benefit Plan that any of the Company and its Subsidiaries
maintains or to which any of the Company and its Subsidiaries contributes or
has any obligation to contribute.   (b) Each such Employee Benefit Plan
(and each related trust, insurance contract, or fund) has been maintained,
funded and administered in accordance with the terms of such Employee Benefit
Plan and complies in form and in operation in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable laws.  
(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.21(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, all
required reports and descriptions (including annual reports (IRS Form 5500),
summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions) have been timely filed
and/or distributed in accordance with the applicable requirements of ERISA
and the Code with respect to each such Employee Benefit   -43-   Plan.
The requirements of COBRA have been met in all material respects with respect
to each such Employee Benefit Plan which is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan
subject to COBRA.   (d) Except as set forth in Section 4.21(d) of
the Disclosure Schedule, all contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) which are due have
been made within the time period prescribed by ERISA to each such Employee
Benefit Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan and all contributions
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date which are not yet due
have been paid to each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan or accrued in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. All premiums or other payments for all periods ending on or
before the Closing Date have been made with respect to each such Employee
Benefit Plan which is an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan.   (e) The Blue Chip
Broadcasting, Inc. 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Company\'s 401(k)
Plan") is the only employee benefit plan maintained by the Company that is
intended to meet the requirements of a "qualified plan" under Code (S)401(a).
The Company\'s 401(k) Plan was originally established effective May 1, 1997
by adoption of a standardized prototype document, and the Company was
entitled to rely on the favorable opinion letter issued by the IRS to the
prototype plan sponsor. The Company\'s 401(k) Plan was amended and restated
effective May 1, 1997 by adoption on June 26, 2000 of a volume submitter
document. The Company intends to file the Company\'s 401(k) Plan as amended
and restated for a determination letter prior to the end of the remedial
amendment period for compliance with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of
1994, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of
1994, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the Taxpayer Relief Act
of 1997 and the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of
1998. The Company does not maintain any Employee Benefit Plans for the
benefit of retired employees, other than the Company\'s 401(k) Plan and COBRA
group health continuation coverage.   After receipt of a favorable
determination letter on plan termination, distributions will be made to
participants in the Company\'s 401(k) Plan, and such participants who
continue in the employment with the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
successor thereto shall be permitted to make a direct rollover of such
distributions to a qualified retirement plan sponsored by the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any successor thereto, including the direct rollover
of any outstanding plan loan obligations. Prior to assumption of such loans,
the Parent shall take such actions as are necessary with respect to its
payroll to assure that the loans of such participants may continue to be
repaid and do not go into default.   (f) The market value of assets under
each such Employee Benefit Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan
(other than any Multiemployer Plan) equals or exceeds the present value of
all vested and nonvested liabilities thereunder (determined in accordance
with then current funding assumptions).   (g) The Company has delivered to
the Parent correct and complete copies of the plan documents and summary plan
descriptions, the most recent determination letter received from the Internal
Revenue Service, the most recent annual report (IRS Form 5500, with all  
-44-   applicable attachments), and all related trust agreements, insurance
contracts, and other funding arrangements which implement each such Employee
Benefit Plan.   (h) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that any of
the Company, its Subsidiaries, and any ERISA Affiliate maintains or to
which any of them contributes, or has any obligation to contribute, or with
respect to which any of them has any liability or potential liability:  
(i) no such Employee Benefit Plan which is an  Employee Pension Benefit Plan
(other than any Multiemployer Plan) has  been completely or partially
terminated or been the subject of a  Reportable Event as to which notices
would be required to be filed with  the PBGC. No proceeding by the PBGC to
terminate any such Employee  Pension Benefit Plan (other than any
Multiemployer Plan) has been  instituted or, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
threatened;   (ii) except as set forth in Section 4.21(h) of the 
Disclosure Schedule, to the Company\'s Knowledge, there have been no 
Prohibited Transactions with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plan.  No
Fiduciary has any liability for material breach of fiduciary duty or  any
other material failure to act or comply in connection with the 
administration or investment of the assets of any such Employee Benefit 
Plan. No action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation with  respect to
the administration or the investment of the assets of any  such Employee
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is  pending or, to the
Company\'s Knowledge, threatened; and   (iii) neither the Company nor any of
its  Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability (whether known or 
unknown, whether asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or  contingent,
whether accrued or unaccrued, whether liquidated or  unliquidated, and
whether due or to become due) to the PBGC (other than  with respect to PBGC
premium payments not yet due) or otherwise under  Title IV of ERISA
(including any withdrawal liability as defined in  ERISA (S)4201) or under
the Code with respect to any such Employee  Benefit Plan which is an Employee
Pension Benefit Plan, or under COBRA  with respect to any such Employee
Benefit Plan which is an Employee  Welfare Benefit Plan.   (i) Neither the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has any
obligation to contribute to, or has any material liability (whether known or
unknown, whether asserted or unasserted, whether absolute or contingent,
whether accrued or unaccrued, whether liquidated or unliquidated, and whether
due or to become due), including any withdrawal liability (as defined in
ERISA (S)4201), under or with respect to any Multiemployer Plan.   (j)
Neither the Company or its Subsidiaries maintains, contributes to or has an
obligation to contribute to, or has any material liability or potential
liability with respect to, any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan providing
medical, health, or life insurance or other welfare-type benefits for current
or future retired or terminated employees, their spouses, or their dependents
(other than in accordance with COBRA).   (k) The Company has complied in all
material respects with all applicable federal and state employment laws,
including, but not limited to, the Family and Medical Leave Act

Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Older Workers Benefit
Protection Act of 1990, the National Labor Relations Act, the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act of 1978, all applicable civil rights acts, the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and all rules and regulations
established by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.   4.22. Guaranties. Neither the

Schedule 4.23, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
predecessors and Affiliates has complied and is in compliance, in each case
in all material respects, with all Environmental, Health, and Safety
Requirements.   (b) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.23, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and
their respective Affiliates, has obtained, has complied, and is in compliance
with, in each case in all material respects, all material permits, licenses
and other authorizations that are required pursuant to Environmental, Health,
and Safety Requirements for the occupation of its facilities and
the operation of its business; a list of all such material permits, licenses
and other authorizations is set forth on the attached Schedule 4.23(b).  
(c) Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.23, neither the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates has received any written or oral
notice, report or other information regarding any actual or alleged material
violation of Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, or any material
liabilities or potential material liabilities (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unliquidated or otherwise), including any material investigatory,
remedial or corrective obligations, relating to any of them or its facilities
arising under Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements.   (d) Except
as set forth on the attached Schedule 4.23(d), none of the following exists
at any property or facility owned or operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in violation of Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements so
as to create a Material Adverse Effect: (i) underground storage tanks; (ii)
asbestos-containing material in any friable and damaged form or condition;
(iii) materials or equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls; or (iv)
landfills, surface impoundments, or disposal areas.   (e) Neither the
Company, its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any of their
respective predecessors or Affiliates has treated, stored, disposed of,
arranged for or permitted the disposal of, transported, handled, or released
any substance, including without limitation any hazardous substance, or owned
or operated any property or facility (and no such property or facility is
contaminated by any such substance) in a manner that has given or would give
rise to liability under any Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements
except any such liability that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  
-46-    (f) Neither this Agreement nor the consummation of the transaction
that is the subject of this Agreement will result in any material obligations
for site investigation or cleanup, or notification to or consent
of government agencies or third parties, pursuant to any of the so-
called "transaction-triggered" or "responsible property transfer"
Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements.   (g) All representations
and warranties applicable to Environmental, Health and Safety Requirements,
hazardous substances, materials or waste, pollutants, contaminants or other
environmental matters are contained solely in this Section 4.23.   4.24.
Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 4 do
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements and information
contained in this Section 4 not misleading.   4.25. Continuity of Business
Enterprise. The Company operates at least one significant historic business
line, or owns at least a significant portion of its historic business assets,
in each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulations (S)1.368-1(d).  
4.26. Continuity of Stockholder Interest. Prior to the Merger, the
Stockholders neither had portions of their Company Shares redeemed by
the Company, nor received extraordinary distributions with respect to their
Company Shares, and no corporation related to the Company within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations ss.1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(B) acquired any Company stock,
where such dispositions or acquisitions would reduce the aggregate fair
market value of the Parent Class D Shares to be received by the Stockholders
as a group (with such fair market value measured as of the Effective Time) to
an amount less than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate fair market value of
the Company\'s stock determined immediately before any of such distributions,
dispositions, or acquisitions.   4.27. Reorganization.   (a) The Company
has no plan or intention to take any action that would cause the Merger not
to qualify and continue to qualify as a reorganization under (S)368(a) of the
Code. The Company liabilities assumed by the Surviving Corporation and
liabilities to which the Company assets are subject were incurred by the
Company in the Ordinary Course of Business; and the Company is not an
"investment company" as defined in (S) 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the
Code. The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or
similar case within the meaning of (S)368(a)(3)(A) of the Code. The fair
market value of the assets of the Company transferred to the
Merger Subsidiary will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by
the Merger Subsidiary, plus the amount of the liabilities, if any, to which
the transferred assets are subject.   (b) The Merger Subsidiary will
acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the net
assets, and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the
gross assets, held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger. For
purposes of this representation, the Company assets used to pay the
Company\'s expenses of the Merger, and all redemptions and distributions made
by the Company in contemplation of the Merger, will be included as assets of
the Company held immediately prior to the Merger.   -47-    4.28.

creditors, voluntary or involuntary, affecting the Company, are pending or,
to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened. The Company has not made
an assignment for the benefit of creditors.   4.29. Certain Interests and
Related Parties. Except as set forth in Section 4.29 of the Disclosure
Schedule, (a) no Stockholder has any material interest in any assets used in
or pertaining to the Company, nor are any Stockholders indebted or otherwise
obligated to the Company; (b) the Company is not indebted or otherwise
obligated to any Stockholder except for amounts due under normal arrangements
as to salary or reimbursement of ordinary business expenses not unusual in
amount or significance; (c) to the Company\'s Knowledge, no Stockholder, nor
any officer or director of the Company has any material interest in any

or found deficient for any reason, the Party liable for the  rejection or
deficiency shall take all reasonable steps to cure the  basis for rejection
or finding for deficiency and, if necessary, the  Parent and the Company
shall jointly resubmit such FCC Application. The  FCC\'s pubic notice or
other written consent to the FCC Applications is  referred to herein as the
"FCC Consent."   5.3. Operation of Business. The Company will not and
will cause its Subsidiaries not to engage in any practice, take any action,

contracts, and documents of or pertaining to the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Parent and the Company hereby reaffirm that the
Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the Parent and the Company
dated October 31, 2000 is still in full force and effect, and shall remain in
full force and effect under the terms of such agreement.   5.7 Notice of
Developments. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Parent of
any material adverse development causing a breach of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 4 hereof. Each Party will give
prompt written notice to the others of any material adverse development
causing a breach of any of his or its own representations and warranties in
Section 3 hereof. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section 5.7,
however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule or to

ALTA Owner\'s Policy of  Title Insurance 1992 Form (or equivalent policy
reasonably acceptable  to the Parent if the real property is located in a
state in which an  ALTA Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance 1992 Form is not
available)  issued by a title insurer (the "Title Company") reasonably
satisfactory  to the Parent (and, if requested by the Parent, reinsured in
whole or  in part by one or more insurance companies and pursuant to a
direct  access agreement reasonably acceptable to the Parent), in such
amount  as the Parent   -50-    reasonably may determine to be the fair

thereon), insuring title  to such real property to be in the Company or its
Subsidiary as of the  Closing (subject only to (i) the title exceptions
described in Sections  4.11(a) and 4.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule and

warranties  contained in Section 4 of this Agreement), together with a copy

of real estate that any  of the Company and its Subsidiaries leases or
subleases and which is  listed on Section 4.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
as a property for  which a title insurance policy is to be procured, an ALTA
Leasehold  Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance-1992 (or equivalent policy
reasonably  acceptable to the Parent if the real property is located in a
state in  which an ALTA Leasehold Owner\'s Policy of Title Insurance-1992 is
not  available) issued by a title insurer reasonably satisfactory to the 
Parent (and, if requested by the Parent, reinsured in whole or in part  by
one or more insurance companies and pursuant to a direct access  agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Parent) in such amount as the  Parent reasonably
may determine (taking into account the time cost of  money using the
Applicable Rate as the discount rate and such other  factors as whether the
fair market rental value of the premises exceeds  the stipulated
consideration in the lease or sublease, whether the  tenant or subtenant has
any option to renew or extend, whether the  tenant or subtenant owns any
improvements located on the premises,  whether the tenant or subtenant is
permitted to sublease, and whether  the tenant or subtenant would owe any
amount under the lease or  sublease if evicted), insuring title to the
leasehold or subleasehold  estate to be in the Company or its Subsidiary as
of the Closing  (subject only to (i) the title exceptions described in
Sections 4.11(a)  and 4.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii) any
exceptions which do  not cause a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in  Section 4 of this Agreement).   Each title insurance policy

creditor\'s right exception deleted, (B) insure title to the real property
and all recorded easements benefitting such real property, (C) contain an

survey of the real property certified to the Parent,  prepared by a licensed
surveyor and conforming to current 1999 ALTA  Minimum Detail Requirements for
Urban Land Title Surveys, including  standards as the Title Company requires

respect to the surveys.   (b) If the title policies obtained by the Parent 
pursuant to Section 5.10 hereof and/or the surveys obtained by the  Parent

Parent shall so notify the Company within no later than  ten (10) business
days prior to the Closing and the amount of money  reasonably required to
cure such defects shall be deducted from the  Adjusted Consideration,
provided that if the cost of curing such  defects would reasonably require
expenditures in excess of $500,000,  the Company shall not be obligated to
reduce the Adjusted Consideration  by such excess. If the amount reasonably

shall have the right at  its option to terminate this Agreement unless the
Company agrees to  further reduce the Adjusted Consideration by the amount in
excess of  $500,000 required to effect the cures desired by the Parent;
provided,  however, that such right to terminate shall expire if not
exercised  before the date on which the Parent elects to delay the Closing
Date as  provided in clause (b) of Section 2.3 hereof.   5.12. Waiver of
Rights. Each Stockholder hereby (a) waives and relinquishes his, her or its

in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.7(a) hereof.   5.15.

percent (70%) of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the
Company immediately prior to the Merger. For this purpose, amounts, if

Parent may disclose any financial statements of the Company and its

The Company shall be provided with copies of any and all such survey reports
at the Company\'s request only. If the survey discloses any material
environmental hazard or liability for environmental damages or clean-up
costs, the Parent shall so notify the Company within fifty (50) days of the
date of this Agreement and the amount of money reasonably required to
cure such environmental hazards or damages shall be deducted from the
Adjusted Consideration, provided that if the remediation of all such hazards
or damages under this Agreement would reasonably require expenditures in
excess of $500,000, the Company shall not be obligated to reduce the
Adjusted Consideration by such amount. If the amount reasonably required to
effect such remediation would exceed $500,000, then the Parent shall have the
right at its option to terminate this Agreement unless the Company agrees to
further reduce the Adjusted Consideration by the amount in excess of $500,000
reasonably required to effect the remediation desired by the Parent;
provided, however, that such right to terminate shall expire if not exercised
before the date on which the Parent elects to delay the Closing Date as
provided in clause (b) of Section 2.3 hereof. The Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Stockholders from any and

intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of the Company and its Subsidiaries
from maintaining the same business relationships with the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.   6.4. Confidentiality. Each of the
Stockholders, severally and not jointly, agree to treat and hold as such all

his, her or its possession. In the event that any of the Stockholders is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, that Stockholder will notify the Parent promptly of the request
or requirement so that the Parent may seek an appropriate protective order or

of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any of the
Stockholders is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt,
that Stockholder may disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal;
provided, however, that the disclosing Stockholder shall use his, her or its

an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the
Parent shall designate.   6.5. Delivery of Final Adjustment Statement. The

Benefit Plan Continuation.   (a) The Parent agrees that it shall continue
the Company health plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing for a

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each Employee Award Payment
when due to the employee entitled thereto. In the event that the Surviving

cash to the Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders in proportion
to the Merger Consideration received by each of them within fifteen (15) days

Stations and Louisville Station.   (a) Enforcement of Louisville Contract
and Lexington Contract.   (i) In the event that the Louisville Contract,

Closing Date, the Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the  sale
of the Louisville Station to be consummated in accordance with the  terms of
the Louisville Contract after the Closing Date. In the event  that the sale
of the Louisville Station contemplated by the Louisville  Contract is
consummated   -57-    prior to Closing Date and, pursuant to the terms of
the Louisville  Contract, any portion of the proceeds are due to the Company
after the  Closing Date, the Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to
collect  such proceeds in accordance with the terms of the Louisville

the  Series B Stockholders shall have the right to pursue and retain the 
collection of any or all such proceeds.   (ii) In the event that the Company
shall have  entered into a Lexington Contract pursuant to Section 5.21(b)

with  the terms of the Lexington Contract after the Closing Date. In the 
event that the sale of the Lexington Stations contemplated by the  Lexington
Contract is consummated prior to Closing Date and, pursuant  to the terms of
the Lexington Contract, any portion of the proceeds are  due to the Company
after the Closing Date, the Parent shall use its  reasonable efforts to
collect such proceeds in accordance with the  terms of the Lexington
Contract. If the Parent is unable to collect all  such proceeds in accordance
with the terms of the Lexington Contract,  the Series A Stockholders and the
Series B Stockholders shall have the  right to pursue and retain the
collection of any or all such proceeds.    (b) Brokered Sale of the
Louisville Station or the  Lexington Stations.   (i) In the event that the
Louisville Contract has  been terminated and the Company shall not have
entered into a new  agreement for the sale of the Louisville Station prior to
the Closing  Date, the Parent shall within thirty (30) days of the Closing
Date,  engage a broker (the "Broker"), reasonably acceptable to the Series
A  Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders, to arrange for the sale of 
the Louisville Station to one or more unaffiliated third parties in an 
arm\'s-length transaction on reasonable terms and conditions. If such  Broker
finds a willing buyer for the Louisville Station within  twenty-four (24)
months of the Closing Date, the Parent shall take all  actions reasonably
necessary to consummate the sale of the Louisville  Station to such buyer,
and the Stockholders shall raise no objection to  such sale. If, on the
twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing  Date, a contract for the
sale of the Louisville Station has not been  executed, the Broker\'s
engagement shall be terminated, and the Parent  shall thereafter have no
further liability or obligation to the  Stockholders with respect to the
Louisville Station.   (ii) In the event that the Company shall not have 
entered into a Lexington Contract pursuant to Section 5.21(b) hereof on  or
prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall within thirty (30) days  of the
Closing Date, engage a Broker reasonably acceptable to the  Series A
Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders, to arrange for the  sale of the
Lexington Stations to one or more unaffiliated third  parties in an

finds a willing buyer for the Lexington  Stations within twenty-four (24)
months of the Closing Date, the Parent  shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to consummate the sale of  the Lexington Stations to such buyer,
and the Stockholders shall raise  no objection to such sale. If, on the
twenty-four (24)   -58-    month anniversary of the Closing Date, a
contract for the sale of the  Lexington Stations has not been executed, the
Broker\'s engagement shall  be terminated, and the Parent shall thereafter
have no further  liability or obligation to the Stockholders with respect to
the  Lexington Stations.   (c) Post-Closing Operation of the Lexington
Stations and  the Louisville Station.   (i) In the event that a sale of the
Lexington  Stations has not been consummated on or prior to the Closing Date,
the  Parent shall assume operational responsibility for the Lexington 
Stations on the Closing Date and shall use its reasonable efforts to  operate
such Lexington Stations in an orderly, efficient and  businesslike manner
until the Lexington Stations are sold or otherwise  transferred in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.10(a) or  Section 6.10(b) hereof. The
revenue and expenses associated with the  post-Closing operation of the
Lexington Stations shall be for the  account of the Parent, provided that the
Parent shall deduct from the  net cash proceeds from the sale of the
Lexington Stations any net  operating losses (the "Lexington Operating
Losses") incurred by the  Parent in connection with its operation of the
Lexington Stations  during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the  earlier of (A) the sale of the Lexington Stations to an
unrelated third  party by the Parent or (B) the date that is twenty-four (24)

Stockholders agree to reimburse the Parent, on a pro rata basis, for  any
Lexington Operating Losses incurred by the Parent in connection  with its
operation of the Lexington Stations which exceed the net cash  proceeds of
the sale of the Lexington Stations or are not recovered by  the Parent from
the Lexington Escrowed Cash.   (ii) In the event that a sale of the
Louisville  Station has not been consummated on or prior to the Closing Date,
the  Parent shall assume operational responsibility for the Louisville 
Station on the Closing Date and shall use its reasonable efforts to  operate
such Louisville Station in an orderly, efficient and  businesslike manner
until the Louisville Station is sold or otherwise  transferred in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.10(a) or  Section 6.10(b) hereof. The Parent
shall deduct from the proceeds from  the sale of the Louisville Station any
net operating losses (the  "Louisville Operating Losses") incurred by the
Parent in connection  with its operation of the Louisville Station during the
period  commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (A) the 
sale of the Louisville Station to an unrelated third party by the  Parent or
(B) the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the  Closing Date. The
Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders  agree to reimburse the
Parent, on a pro rata basis, for any Louisville  Operating Losses incurred by
the Parent in connection with its  operation of the Louisville Station which
exceed the net cash proceeds  of the sale of the Louisville Station or are
not recovered by the  Parent from the Louisville Escrowed Cash.   (iii) The
Parent shall provide, upon reasonable  request from the Series A
Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\'
Representative, appropriate documentation and records to  allow the Series A
Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\' Representative
to perform a reasonable audit of the  Lexington   -59-    Net Operating
Losses prior to the deduction of such losses from the  proceeds of the sale
of the Lexington Stations or the satisfaction of  the Series A Stockholders
and the Series B Stockholders\' obligation to  reimburse the Parent for such
losses pursuant to Section 6.10(c)(i)  above. If the Series A Stockholders\'
Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\' Representative dispute any
item in the Lexington Net  Operating Losses, the Series A Representative and
the Series B  Stockholders\' Representative shall notify the Parent in
writing thereof  (specifying the amount of each item in dispute and setting
forth in  reasonable detail the basis for each item in dispute) within
fifteen  (15) business days of receipt by the Series A Stockholders\' 
Representative and the Series B Stockholders\' Representative of the 
documentation and records provided to the Series A Representative and  the
Series B Stockholders\' Representative. If the Series A  Stockholders\'
Representative and the Series B Stockholders\'  Representative do not notify
the Parent of any such dispute within such  time, then the Lexington Net
Operating Losses shall be deemed to be  final and binding on the parties. In
the event of such a dispute, the  parties shall negotiate in good faith to
attempt to reconcile their  differences. If such dispute has not been
resolved within twenty (20)  business days, the parties shall submit the
items remaining in dispute  for resolution to the Independent Accounting
Firm, which shall, as  promptly as practicable but in any event within twenty
(20) business  days, resolve the disputed items and report to the parties,
and such  report shall have the effect of an arbitral award and shall be
final  and binding on the parties. The fees and disbursements of the 
Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated equally between the  Parent
and the Series A Stockholders and the Series B Stockholders.   (iv) The
Parent shall provide, upon reasonable  request from the Series A
Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\'
Representative, appropriate documentation and records to  allow the Series A
Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\' Representative

Stockholders\' satisfaction of the  obligation to reimburse the Parent for
such losses pursuant to Section  6.10(c)(ii) above. If the Series A
Stockholders\' Representative and the  Series B Stockholders\' Representative
dispute any item in the  Louisville Net Operating Losses, the Series A
Stockholders\'  Representative and the Series B Stockholders\' Representative
shall  notify the Parent in writing thereof (specifying the amount of each 
item in dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for  each
item in dispute) within fifteen (15) business days of receipt by  the Series
A Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\'
Representative of the documentation and records provided  to the Series A
Stockholders\' Representative and the Series B  Stockholders\'
Representative. If the Series A Stockholders\'  Representative and the Series
B Stockholders\' Representative do not  notify the Parent of any such dispute
within such time, then the  Louisville Net Operating Losses shall be deemed
to be final and binding  on the parties. In the event of such a dispute, the
parties shall  negotiate in good faith to attempt to reconcile their
differences. If  such dispute has not been resolved within twenty (20)
business days,  the parties shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution  to the Independent Accounting Firm, which shall, as promptly as 
practicable but in any event within twenty (20) business days, resolve  the
disputed items and report to the parties, and such report shall  have the
effect of an arbitral award and shall be final and binding on  the parties.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting  Firm shall  
-60-    be allocated equally between the Parent and the Series A
Stockholders  and the Series B Stockholders.   (d) Sale Proceeds and
Expenses.   (i) Promptly upon the receipt by the Surviving  Corporation of
any cash proceeds for the sale of the Lexington Stations  under Sections

executed in connection with such sale), the  Parent shall distribute to the
Series A Stockholders and the Series B  Stockholders, on a pro rata basis,
such proceeds, provided that the  Parent may, at its option, first deduct
from such proceeds (i) the  reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Parent in connection with  such sale, to the extent such costs and expenses

or By-laws of the Company and the applicable organizational documents of its
Subsidiaries or any Indemnity Agreement (as defined below) shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect. To the extent permitted by (i)
the Delaware General Corporation Law (or the applicable state corporation or
limited liability company laws as to any Subsidiary that is not formed under
the laws of the State of Delaware), (ii) the organizational documents of the
Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, or (iii) any agreement providing
for indemnification by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any
Indemnitee in effect on the date of this Agreement (including any indemnity
provisions contained in any agreement providing for the registration of

defined below) pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be mandatory rather than

(as defined   -61-   below) in connection with such indemnification. The
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, expressly assume
and honor in accordance with their terms all Indemnity Agreements.   (b) In
addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 6.11 and not in
limitation thereof, for six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest

against all losses, Expenses (as hereinafter defined), claims, damages,
liabilities, judgments, or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Costs")
in respect to any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or
proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative based
on, or arising out of or relating to the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, manager or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time (excluding acts or omissions in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) (an "Indemnifiable DandO;
Claim") and (ii) advance to such Indemnitees all Expenses incurred in
connection with any Indemnifiable DandO; Claim promptly after receipt of
reasonably detailed statements therefor; provided, that, except as otherwise
provided pursuant to any Indemnity Agreement, the person to whom Expenses are
to be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification from the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event
any Indemnifiable DandO; Claim is asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification and advancement of Expenses in respect of any
such Indemnifiable DandO; Claim shall continue until such Indemnifiable DandO;
Claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in
connection with such Indemnifiable DandO; Claim are fully satisfied; provided,
however, that the Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). Except as otherwise may be provided pursuant to any Indemnity
Agreement, the Indemnitees as a group may retain only one law firm with
respect to each related matter except to the extent there is, in the opinion
of counsel to an Indemnitee, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between positions of any two or
more Indemnitees. For the purposes of this Section 6.11, "Expenses" shall
include reasonable attorneys\' fees and all other costs, charges and expenses
paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness
in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a
witness in or participate in any Indemnifiable DandO; Claim.   (c)

Corporation. In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11.   -62-    (d) The obligations of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, and the Parent under this Section 6.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.11 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnitee (it

shall not apply to the Stockholders\' liability to indemnify the Parent for
Adverse Consequences arising from any breach of the representation and

liable. Claims for indemnification under this Section 8.2(a) shall be the

contained in Section 4 hereof.   (b) In the event any Stockholder breaches
any of his, her or its representations and warranties contained in Section

indemnification against such Stockholder pursuant to Section 11.8, then that
Stockholder severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify the Parent from and
against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Parent may suffer
through and after the date of the claim for indemnification resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach. The
Parent shall be entitled to satisfy such claim from amounts of Escrowed
Property withheld from distributions to be made to such Stockholder pursuant
to Section 2.6(c)(iii) hereof, and otherwise, the Parent shall proceed
directly against any Stockholder with respect to any claim for
indemnification under this Section 8.2(b).   (c) In the event any of the

Series A Stockholders agree to indemnify the Parent from and against any
Adverse Consequences the Parent may suffer through and after the date of the
claim for indemnification arising directly out of the indemnification
provisions of the Cincinnati Contract, including any adverse tax consequences

(e) Any indemnification claim arising under Section 8.2(a) hereof (other than
any such claim arising from the breach of a covenant set forth in Section 5
hereof) shall be paid out of the Escrowed Property (and the accrued interest
thereon), provided that, to the extent that the Escrowed Property (and the
accrued interest thereon) is insufficient to cover such claim as a result of
the adjustment set forth in Section 2.6(a) hereof, each Series A Stockholder
and Series B Stockholder shall be obligated to pay to the Parent his, her or
its pro rata portion of the amount by which such claim exceeds the Escrowed
Property (and accrued interest thereon).   -68-    8.3. Indemnification
Provisions for Benefit of the Stockholders. In the event the Parent breaches
any of its representations, warranties, and covenants contained herein, and,
if there is an applicable survival period pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof,
provided that any of the Stockholders makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Parent pursuant to Section 11.8 hereof within
such survival period, then the Parent agrees to indemnify each of the
Stockholders from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the
Stockholder may suffer through and after the date of the claim for
indemnification (including any Adverse Consequences such Stockholder may
suffer after the end of any applicable survival period) resulting from,

8.4. Matters Involving Third Parties.   (a) If any third party shall notify
any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third
Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against any
other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Section 8, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent)
the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.   (b) Any Indemnifying Party
will have the right to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with
counsel of his, her or its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party at any time within 15 days after the Indemnified Party has given notice
of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party must
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently
thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard; and, provided
further, however, that the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel
at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third
Party Claim.   (c) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and
is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with
Section 8.4(b) hereof, (i) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not
to be withheld unreasonably) unless the judgment or proposed settlement
involves only the payment of money damages by one or more of the Indemnifying
Parties and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not
to be withheld unreasonably).   (d) In the event none of the Indemnifying
Parties assumes and conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance with Section 8.4(b) hereof, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may
defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner he or it
reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult
with, or obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith) and (ii) the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible for any
Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising   -69-   out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the
Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 8.   8.5.

adjustments for tax consequences and insurance coverage and take into account
the time cost of money (using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate) in

are intended to be the sole remedies of the Parties as to the other Parties
subsequent to the Closing Date as to all matters arising out of the breach of
any representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement,
except as expressly specified to the contrary in this Section 8.6. In the
event that all conditions set forth in Section 7 hereof are satisfied on
or before the Final Closing Date and the Closing of the transactions is
not consummated as a result of actions taken by the Company or Stockholders,
the Parent shall be entitled to seek as against the Company and Stockholders
all remedies normally available to a party for breach of a contract,
including but not limited to specific performance and damages proximately

hereof are satisfied on or before the Final Closing Date and the Closing of
the transactions is not consummated as a result of actions taken by the
Parent, the Company\'s and the Stockholders\' sole and exclusive remedy shall
be as set forth in Section 10.2 hereof. Each of the Stockholders hereby
agrees that he, she or it will not make any claim for indemnification against
the Company and its Subsidiaries by reason of the fact that he, she or it was
a director, officer, employee, or agent of any such entity or was serving at
the request of any such entity as a partner, trustee, director, officer,
employee, or agent of another entity (whether such claim is for judgments,
damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses,
expenses, or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any statute,
charter document, bylaw, agreement, or otherwise) with respect to any action,
suit, proceeding, complaint, claim, or demand for indemnification by such
Stockholder pursuant to this Section 8 brought by the Parent against such
Stockholder (whether such action, suit, proceeding, complaint, claim, or
demand is pursuant to this Agreement, applicable law, or otherwise).   9.
Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between the Parent and the Stockholders for certain tax
matters following the Closing Date:   9.1. Tax Periods Ending on or Before
the Closing Date. The Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the
Closing Date. The Stockholders shall reimburse the Parent for (a) Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such periods within fifteen
(15) days after payment by the Parent or the Company and its Subsidiaries of
such Taxes to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax
Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the
Final Adjustment Statement, and (b) for all cost and expenses incurred by the
Parent in connection with the Parent\'s preparation of Tax Returns pursuant
to this Section 9.1.   -70-    9.2. Tax Periods Beginning Before and
Ending After the Closing Date. The Parent shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date. The Stockholders shall pay to the Parent within
fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such
periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such
Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Final Adjustment Statement. For
purposes of this Section 9, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case
of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon
or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. Any
credits relating to a Tax period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant Tax period
ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries.   9.3. Cooperation on Tax
Matters.   (a) The Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the Stockholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section 9 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Party\'s request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
The Stockholders agree (i) to retain all books and records in their
possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the Parent reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Stockholders shall allow the
Parent to take possession of such books and records.   (b) The Parent and
the Stockholders further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or
any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).   (c) The Parent and the Stockholders
further agree, upon request, to provide the other party with all information
that either party may be required to report pursuant to ss.6043 of the Code
and all Treasury Department Regulations promulgated thereunder.  
-71-    9.4. Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder.   9.5. Certain Taxes. All transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement, shall be paid equally by the Stockholders and the Parent when due.
The Stockholders will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law,
the Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The expense of such filings
(including fees payable in connection with Section 5.23 hereof) shall be
borne equally by the Stockholders and the Parent.   10. Termination.  
10.1. Termination of Agreement. Certain of the Parties may terminate this
Agreement as provided below:   (a) the Parent and the Company may terminate
this  Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the
Closing;   (b) the Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving  written
notice to the Company and to the Stockholders\' Representatives  at any time
prior to the Closing (i) in the event any of the  Stockholders or the Company
has breached any material representation,  warranty, or covenant contained in
this Agreement in any material  respect, the Parent has notified the Company
and the Stockholders\'  Representatives in writing of the breach, and the
breach has continued  without cure for a period of 30 days after the notice
of breach, (ii)  if the Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  Sections 5.8, 5.11 or 5.19 hereof, or (iii) if the Closing shall
not  have occurred on or before the Final Closing Date by reason of the 
failure of any condition precedent under Section 7.1 hereof (unless the 
failure results primarily from the Parent itself breaching any 
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement); and  
(c) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving  written notice to the
Parent at any time prior to the Closing (i) in  the event the Parent has
breached any material representation,  warranty, or covenant contained in
this Agreement in any material  respect, the Company has notified the Parent
of the breach, and the  breach has continued without cure for a period of 30
days after the  notice of breach or (ii) if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or  before the Final Closing Date by reason of the failure of any
condition  precedent under Section 7.2 hereof (unless the failure results 
primarily from any of the Stockholders or the Company breaching any 
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement;  provided,
however, that if the Closing has not occurred solely as the  result of the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(i) hereof not having  been satisfied, and
the Closing has not been delayed by the Parent  pursuant to clause (b) of
Section 2.3 hereof, the Parent shall have the  right, at its option, to
increase the number of Parent Class D Shares   -72-    constituting the
Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration so as to cause  such condition to be
satisfied), and, further provided, however, that  if the Closing has not
occurred solely as a result of the condition set  forth in Section 7.2(i)
hereof not having been satisfied and the  Closing has been delayed by the
Parent pursuant to clause (b) of  Section 2.3 hereof, the Parent shall
increase the number of Parent  Class D Shares constituting the Aggregate
Merger Consideration so as to  cause such condition to be satisfied. In the
event that additional  Parent Class D Shares are issued pursuant to the
preceding sentence,  then such shares shall be issued to the Series A
Stockholders, the  Series B Stockholders and the Series D Stockholders in the
same  proportions as the Parent Class D Shares were to be issued to them as 
if the additional shares were not being issued.   10.2. Effect of
Termination.   (a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Sections 10.1(a), 10.1(b)(ii), 10.1(b)(iii) or 10.1(c)(ii) hereof, all rights
and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any
liability of any Party to any other Party (except for any liability of any
Party then in breach).   (b) If the Parent has the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i) hereof, then, at the Parent\'s
election, in addition to any other remedy available to it, the Parent shall
be entitled to an injunction restraining any such breach or threatened breach
and, subject to obtaining any requisite approval of the FCC, to enforcement
of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance requiring the Company
and the Stockholders to fulfill their respective obligations under this
Agreement, in each case without the necessity of showing economic loss or
other actual damage and without any bond or other security being required.
The remedies provided the Parent in this Agreement shall be cumulative and
shall not preclude the assertion by the Parent of any other rights or the
seeking of any other remedies against the Stockholders.   (c) If the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i) hereof,
then, the Company shall be entitled to the liquidated damages as set forth in
Section 2.2(b) hereof; provided, however, that, if the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i) hereof after the Closing has
been delayed by the Parent pursuant to clause (b) of Section 2.3 hereof, the
Parent shall pay to the Company, in addition to the liquidated damages set
forth in Section 2.2(b) hereof, cash in the amount of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000.00).   11. Miscellaneous.   11.1. Nature of Certain
Obligations. The representations and warranties of each of the Stockholders
in Section 3.1 hereof concerning the transaction are several obligations.
This means that the particular Stockholder making the representation or
warranty will be solely responsible to the extent provided in Section 8
hereof for any Adverse Consequences the Parent may suffer as a result of any
breach thereof.   11.2. Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party
shall issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement prior to   -73-   the Closing without
the prior written approval of the Parent and the Stockholders; provided,
however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it believes in good
faith is required by applicable law or any listing or trading agreement
concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing Party
will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other Parties prior to
making the disclosure).   11.3. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set
forth in Sections 6.8, 6.9 and 6.11 hereof, this Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.   11.4. Entire Agreement. This
Agreement (including the documents referred to herein) constitutes the entire
agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior negotiations,
understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the subject matter
hereof.   11.5. Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either
this Agreement or any of his, her or its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of the Parent and the
Stockholders; provided, however, that the Parent may (a) assign any or all of
its rights and interests hereunder to (i) one or more of its Affiliates or
(ii) the Senior Lenders as collateral, and (b) designate one or more of its
Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases
the Parent nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of
its obligations hereunder), but in no event shall such an assignment be
permitted if it would result in delaying the Closing.   11.6. Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument.   11.7. Headings. The section headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   11.8. Notices. All
notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder will

hereunder shall be deemed duly given if (and then two business days after) it

Appointment and Authority. The Series A Stockholders, for themselves and
their personal representatives and other successors, hereby constitute and

Series B Stockholders, for themselves and their personal representatives and
other successors, hereby constitute and appoint Nils Larsen (the "Series B
Stockholders\' Representative") and the Series D Stockholders, for themselves
and their personal representatives and other successors, hereby constitute
and appoint Lauren Tyler (the "Series D Stockholders\' Representative")
(each, a "Stockholders\' Representative" and, collectively, the
"Stockholders\' Representatives") with full power and authority (including
power of substitution), except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, in the name of and for and on behalf of the Stockholders or
in their own name as Stockholders\' Representatives, to take all actions
required or permitted to be taken by the Stockholders, or any of them, under
this Agreement (including the giving and receiving of all reports, notices
and consents hereunder). Any action taken or document executed by the
Stockholders\' Representatives shall be valid and binding only if agreed to
in writing or executed by all of the Stockholders\' Representatives. The
authority conferred under this Section 11.9 is an agency coupled with an
interest, and all authority conferred hereby is irrevocable and not subject
to termination by the Stockholders, or by any of them, or by operation of
law, whether by the death or incapacity of any Stockholder, the termination
of any trust or estate, or the occurrence of any other event. If any
Stockholder should die or become incapacitated, if any trust or estate should
terminate, or if any other such event should occur, any action taken by the
Stockholders\' Representatives pursuant to this Section 11.9 shall be as
valid as if such death or incapacity, termination or other event had not
occurred, regardless of whether or not the Stockholders\' Representatives or
the Parent shall have received notice of such death, incapacity, termination
or other event. Any notice given to the Stockholders\' Representatives
pursuant to Section 11.8 hereof shall constitute effective notice to all
Stockholders, and the Parent or any other person may rely on any notice,
consent, election or other communication received from the Stockholders\'
Representatives as if it had been received from all Stockholders on whose
behalf it was given.   (b) Successors. A Stockholders\' Representative
may resign upon twenty (20) days\' prior written notice to the Parent and
each other Stockholder. Upon the death, resignation, removal or incapacity of
a Stockholders\' Representative, the Stockholders of the series of the
Company\'s Common Stock who appointed such Stockholders\' Representative
shall appoint a successor Stockholders\' Representative, by written consent
of the holders of a majority of the   -76-   outstanding shares of such
series immediately prior to the Effective Time, and any successor
Stockholders\' Representative so appointed shall, with the surviving
Stockholders\' Representative, constitute the Stockholders\' Representatives
to the same effect as if originally named in this Section 11.9. The
Stockholders of the series of the Company\'s Common Stock who appointed
such Stockholders\' Representative may remove its Stockholders\'
Representative at any time, by written consent of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of such series immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The remaining Stockholders\' Representatives shall give the Parent
written notice of the appointment or removal of any Stockholders\'
Representative pursuant to this Section 11.9, including a copy of the written
consent of the Stockholders having the power to so appoint or remove such
Stockholders\' Representative relating thereto, as soon as practicable after
any such appointment or removal, and such appointment or removal shall not be
effective as against the Parent or the other Stockholders until such notice
shall have been given, unless the Parent or the other Stockholders shall have
actual knowledge of such appointment or removal.   11.10. Governing Law.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.   11.11. Amendments and
Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Parent and the
Stockholders. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.   11.12.
Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction.   11.13. Expenses. Each of the
Parties will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   11.14. Construction. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to
any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without
limitation.   11.15. Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules.
