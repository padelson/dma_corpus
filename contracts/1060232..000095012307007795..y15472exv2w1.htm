 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates_   

  

 5.1.  _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock (a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _ _Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders (" _ _Dissenting Shareholders__ ") who are entitled to demand and have made a demand for appraisal and who have otherwise perfected appraisal rights in accordance 

    ##### 

  

 

with the MBCA, not voted in favor of the Merger and have not withdrawn a
demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA, if applicable
(each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ ," and collectively, _"_ _ _Excluded Shares__
_"_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive $20.50 per Share, without
interest (the _"_ _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__ _")_. At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a _"_ _ _Certificate__ _"_ )
formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under Section 5.2(f). 

   

 (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 5.2.  _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall (i) designate, or cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment or exchange in accordance with this Article V of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the Shareholders. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds in an amount sufficient in the aggregate to make the payments contemplated by Section 5.1(a) (the " _ _Merger Consideration__ ") of this Agreement, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement (such funds, the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make all such payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any amounts in excess of the Merger Consideration shall be promptly returned to Parent. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 5.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 5.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 5.2(e)) to the 

    ##### 

  

 

Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 5.2(g)) equal
to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 5.2(e)) multiplied by (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE V. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Shareholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE V shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 5.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

   

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration. 

   

 (f) _Appraisal Rights_. No holder of Dissenting Shares who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to the MBCA shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the MBCA. Each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Part 13 of 

    ##### 

  

 

the MBCA with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company
relating to shareholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal
under the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent or pursuant to a valid court order, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. 

   

 5.3.  _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

  

 (a)  _Company Action_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary: 

   

(i) to cause any unexercisable options to purchase Shares (" _ _Company Stock
Options__ ") granted under any stock option plans or other equity-related
plans of the Company (the " _ _Stock Plans__ ") to be accelerated and become
exercisable in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; 

  

       | (ii)  |   | to effectuate the termination upon
the Effective Time of all Company Stock Options outstanding at such
time (without regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock
Options); and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (iii)  |   | to cause, pursuant to the Stock Plans,
each outstanding Company Stock Option to represent upon the Effective
Time solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 5.3,
a lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration
(as defined below), if any, with respect to such Company Stock Option and to
no longer represent the right to purchase Company Common Stock or any other
equity security of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or any other person or any other consideration.  
   

  

 (b) _Option Consideration_. Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each 

    ##### 

  

 

Company Stock Option so cancelled, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than 10 (ten)
business days following the Effective Time; provided that the Company
provides to Parent at the Closing an accurate and updated list of the Company
Stock Options outstanding as of the Closing), an amount equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B)
the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied
by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option
(whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any interest thereon
(the " _ _Option Consideration__ "), which cash payment shall be treated as
compensation and shall be net of any applicable federal or state withholding
tax. In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Option
Consideration for such Company Stock Option shall be zero and such Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled and have no further force or effect. 

   

 (c) _Instructions_. As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 5.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options. Parent shall at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 5.3. 

   

 (d) _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is subject to vesting and restrictions on transfer (" _ _Company Restricted Stock__ ") and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become at the Effective Time fully vested and free of restrictions on transfer and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration subject to the terms and conditions of Article V hereof. 

   

 (e) _Company Awards_. Except as set forth on Section 5.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, at the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans, other than Company Options (the _"_ _ _Company Awards__ _"_ ), shall be cancelled and no longer represent the right to acquire any Shares or other equity security of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration. 

   

 (f) _Registration_. If registration of any interests in the Stock Plans or other Benefit Plans is required under the Securities Act, Parent shall file with the SEC on the Effective Time a registration statement on Form S 8 with respect to such interests, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the relevant Stock Plans or other Benefit Plans, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests therein continues to be required. As soon as practicable after the registration of such interests, as applicable, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Options and Company Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Options and Company Awards, and stating that such Company Options and Company Awards and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.3 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Stock Plans). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

   

 (h) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall amend the Companys Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the _"_ _ _ESPP__ _"_ ) to suspend any payroll deductions and the purchase of additional Shares immediately after the next regularly scheduled date on which Shares are purchased under the Companys ESPP. The Company shall terminate the ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time.

the Transactions. 

  

 (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i) constitute or result in a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of organization, by laws or the comparable governing instruments of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) constitute or result in, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions) compliance with the matters referred to in Section 6.1.4(a), under any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) constitute or result in any change (adverse to the interests of the Company) in the rights or obligations of any party under any Contract binding on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation to the Transactions.

tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of
ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur a material tax or penalty imposed by Section
4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any liability under Section 4071

Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has been required to file information pursuant to Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year. It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be materially increased by application of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a change in funding method, of such Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year. 

  

 (f) As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened material litigation relating to the Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement. The Company or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination. 

  

 (g) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither the execution of this Agreement, shareholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (i) entitle any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or, after the consummation of the Transactions, Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans or (iv) result in payments under any of the Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. 

  

 (h) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects with applicable local Law. All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed on Section 6.1.9(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened material litigation relating to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

Entity. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, no change is
required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries processes,
properties or procedures to comply with any Laws applicable as of the date
hereof and the Company has not received any written notice of any
noncompliance with any such Laws from a Governmental Entity that has not been

 7.2. _No Solicitation of Transactions; Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that, except as permitted by this Section 7.2, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the 

   ##### 

  

    

officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use
its reasonable best efforts to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: 

  

 (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); 

  

 (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

 (iii) otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, after any officer or director of the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including (i) the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (ii) a copy of all written materials provided by such Person in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (iii) a written summary, if it is not in writing, of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company shall continue promptly to keep Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including, but not limited to, notice of all material amendments thereto, notice of withdrawal or rejection thereof). The Company shall provide Parent with two business days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board at which such Company Board is reasonably expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal or any Change of Recommendation. 

  

 (c) If, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company receives from a Person a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent written notice (the " _ _Superior Proposal Notice__ ") that shall state (i) that it has received a Superior Proposal (or an Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal), (ii) the identity of the Person making such proposal and (iii) the material terms and conditions of such proposal and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such Person as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 10.7); provided, that, contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes to Parent all such non-public information not previously provided to Parent or (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person, if prior to taking any action described in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to take any action described in clause (A) or (B) above would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law and the Company Board believes 

   ##### 

  

    

in good faith, after consultation with its advisors, that the Acquisition
Proposal in respect of which such action is to be taken, if consummated, is
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (a " _ _Board
Determination__ "). 

  

 (d) The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not: 

  

 (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or make any statement with the substantive effect of withholding, withdrawing, qualifying or modifying), in a manner adverse to Parent (any such action, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), the Company recommendation with respect to the Merger unless the Company Board is entitled to take the actions specified under Section 7.2(d)(ii); 

  

 (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) a transaction relating to an Acquisition Proposal unless the Company Board has made a Board Determination with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or 

  

 (iii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, this Section 7.2 or Section 9.1(d), cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with Section 7.2(c)) (an " _ _Alternative Acquisition Agreement__ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to receipt of the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 7.2, withhold, withdraw or modify its recommendation with respect to the Company Voting Proposal or approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, but only on or after the third (3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Company Board desires to withhold, withdraw or modify the recommendation due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including any material changes) and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal . Such three (3) Business Day period shall be required for each and every Superior Proposal or material modification thereto, as applicable. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if such disclosure has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 9.1(c). 

  

 (g) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted 

   ##### 

  

    

heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that
it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 7.2 and in the Confidentiality Agreement. Since
May 1, 2006, neither the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Companys or its
Subsidiaries Representatives have executed a confidentiality agreement with
a third party (other than Parent) in connection with such third partys
consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or a
material portion of their assets or equity. 

  

 7.3.  _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within 30 days of this Agreement, a proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders Meeting (the " _ _Proxy Statement__ ").

 7.4. _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by laws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of the Shareholders (the " _ _Shareholders Meeting__ ") to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement. The Shareholders Meeting shall be held on a date agreed to by the parties hereto no later than 30 business days following the earliest of the date on which the SEC staff advises the Company that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (or that the SEC staff advises that it is not reviewing the Proxy Statement) or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. At the Shareholders Meeting, the Company Board shall recommend approval of this Agreement (unless a Change of Recommendation shall have occurred prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained), and even if a Change of Recommendation has occurred shall take all lawful action to submit the adoption of this Agreement. Without the consent of Parent, The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting, except to the extent required by applicable Law. 

  

 7.5.  _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. 

  

 (b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all 

   ##### 

  

    

documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing
in this Agreement, including without limitation, this Section 7.5, shall
require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold
separate and agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale,
divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by
the Company of any of its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein or to any agreement by the Company to
take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to any material change
(including without limitation, through a licensing arrangement) or
restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own or operate, of
any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interests therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends
or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the
Surviving Company, (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to take any other
action under this Section 7.5 if the United States Department of Justice or
the United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff to seek a
preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger, and (iii) nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 7.5 shall
require Parent and its Affiliates to make any material payments, other than
filing fees required by Law, or provide any other material consideration
in connection with any waiver or consent reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
Transactions (or to consent to any material payment, other than filing fees
required by Law, or provide any other material consideration by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such waivers or consents). Subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions (including the Proxy Statement).
In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (c) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon reasonable request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions. 

  

 (d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Law and as required by any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating 

   ##### 

  

    

to completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other material communications received by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third
party and/or Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other
Transactions. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change,
fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or
any other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat. 

  

 7.6. _Access and Reports_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, contracts, books and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent all readily available information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, that in its reasonable judgment would: (a) violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality (provided that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of any confidentiality obligation); (d) jeopardize protections afforded it under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine (provided that the Company shall take any commercially reasonable action to allow such access to be granted in whole or in part without jeopardizing such protections); (e) violate any Law; or (f) materially interfere with the conduct of its business. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement. The Company shall furnish promptly to Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it or its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Legal Requirements to the extent that such report, schedule, registration statement or other document is not publicly available on EDGAR. 

  

 7.7.  _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date. 

  

 7.8.  _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent, and thereafter the parties hereto shall consult with each other and give due consideration to any reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party and its counsel prior to 

   ##### 

  

    

issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that (i) the
Company need not consult with Parent in connection with any press release or
public statement to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or with respect to any Change in Recommendation and (ii) Parent need
not consult with the Company in connection with any press release or
public statement to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or with respect to any Change in Recommendation. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
materials that are to be presented during any road shows conducted
in connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated herein, and
Parent shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.8, Parent may utilize
such materials in substantially the form presented (after consideration of any
comments received from the Company or its counsel) and make public statements
consistent with such materials during the road show, without any further
consultation, approval, review or commentary from the Company or its
counsel. 

  

 7.9. _Employee Benefits_. (a) Parent agrees that during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed after the Effective Time (the " _ _Company Employees__ ") will continue to be provided with base salary, commissions, cash-based incentive opportunities, pension and welfare benefits at levels that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those currently provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employees without regard to any compensation or benefit arrangements, whether special incentives or otherwise, implemented by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent will cause any employee benefit plans which the Company Employees are entitled to participate in to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations under any health or similar plan of Parent to be waived with respect to the Company Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Date, and any deductibles paid by the Company Employee under any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Date occurs shall be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. Parent will make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.9(b) and (c), nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular benefit plan, or (ii) retain the employment of any particular employee; provided, however, that Parent shall continue to maintain the Companys Benefit Plans (other than stock-based plans) until the Company Employees are permitted to participate in the plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in accordance with Section 7.9(a). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Existing Compensation Agreements_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, all compensation agreements listed in Section 7.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) _Severance Plans_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to keep in effect without modification and honor the severance plans listed in Section 7.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Date. 

  

 (d) The Company agrees to cause each of its officers and directors to repay any outstanding liens or notes to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 7.10.  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the publishing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (but not the attorneys fees related thereto, which shall be paid by the party incurring such expense) shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company. 

  

 7.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the _"_ _ _Indemnified Parties__ _"_ ), against any Costs incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under Massachusetts Law and its articles of organization or by laws in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under Massachusetts Law and the Companys articles of organization and by laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 7.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in 

   ##### 

  

    

connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with
a conflict of interest; _provided_ , that the fewest number of counsels
necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that
the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. 

  

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy (which by its terms shall survive the Merger) for its directors and officers, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable on the whole to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is less than $650,000. In the event that less than $650,000 is insufficient for such coverage, the Company may spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.11. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 7.11 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (f) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided for in the respective organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof, shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time. During such period, Parent shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for indemnification in any manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of 

   ##### 

  

    

individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time was a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company and its Subsidiary in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), unless such modification is required by law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made either
prior to the Effective Time or within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims. 

  

 7.12. _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and close any financing necessary for it to deliver the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to provide, such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of, and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, its financing (and any substitutions, replacements or refinancing thereof), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause appropriate officers and employees to be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with prospective lenders and due diligence sessions each conducted at the expense of Parent, and (ii) assist with the preparation of disclosure documents in connection therewith, provided that the Company shall not be obligated to incur any liability to any third party on account thereof. 

  

 7.13. _Other Actions by the Company_. __  

  

 (a) _Rights_. Prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company Board shall take all necessary action to cause the Rights to cease to be outstanding and to terminate the Rights Agreement, effective immediately as of the Effective Time, without payment of any consideration in respect thereof. 

  

 (b) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other Transactions, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such Transactions. 

  

 7.14.  _Parent Vote_. If a Stockholders Meeting is held, Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to) any Shares and any shares of common stock of Merger Sub beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement at any meeting of stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at which this Agreement shall be submitted for adoption and approval and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable, by any action of shareholders of either the Company or Merger Sub by consent in lieu of a meeting).

make a recommendation; (v) there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect on any
date subsequent to the date of this Agreement, such that Section 8.2(b) would
not be satisfied and such breach or failure to be true or correct is
not curable or, if curable, has not been cured within the earlier of (x) the
Termination Date, and (y) 30 days after written notice thereof has been given
by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company, or (vi) the Company shall have
materially breached its obligations under Section 7.2; or 

  

 (d) by the Company, (i) if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, such that Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, has not been cured within the earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such breach or (ii) in connection with entering into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.2; provided, however, that prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d), the Company shall have (i) provided Parent with three (3) business days prior written notice of the Companys decision to so terminate (which notification shall indicate in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including, without limitation, the amount and form of the proposed consideration and whether such Superior Proposal is subject to any material conditions), (ii) prior to 5:00 p.m. Massachusetts time on the third Business Day of such three (3) Business Day period Parent has not made an offer that in the reasonable judgment of the Company Board after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors is at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view as such Superior Proposal; and (iii) the Company prior to or concurrently with such termination pays to Parent in immediately available funds all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.2(b);
