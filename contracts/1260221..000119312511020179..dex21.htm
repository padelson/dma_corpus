<U>Section&nbsp;2.3(b)</U>, Buyer will make available to Sellers, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, all records and work papers used by Buyer or its agents in preparing each Closing Balance Sheet, and its computation

to resolve any disagreement as to the computation of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date as soon as practicable, but if they cannot reach a final resolution within thirty
(30)&nbsp;calendar days after Buyer has received the Objection Notice, Buyer and Sellers will jointly retain an internationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to both Buyer and Sellers (the &#147;<U>Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). Buyer and
Sellers will direct the Accounting Firm to render a determination within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days of its retention and Buyer and Sellers and their respective agents will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during its engagement. The Accounting
Firm will consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Objection Notice that Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. In rendering its determination, the Accounting Firm shall act as an expert in GAAP and not as an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm&#146;s
determination will be based on such review as the Accounting Firm deems necessary to make its determination, the definitions Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement and the
methodologies, practices and assumptions used in preparing each Base Balance Sheet (see <U>Section&nbsp;4.7(a)</U>). The determination of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date by
