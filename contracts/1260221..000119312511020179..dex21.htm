(a) _Closing Date Adjustment_. The purpose of the purchase price adjustments
set forth in this _Section 2.3_ is to measure, with respect to each of
Valley-Todeco and Linread separately, any changes in Working Capital of each
of the Fastener Subsidiaries from their respective targets to the final
amounts on the same accounting basis consistently applied to reflect
transactions and/or events up to and conditions existing at the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Determination_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a balance sheet for
each of the Fastener Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (each a " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ "), a computation of Cash and Cash Equivalents and the Working
Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries based upon each Closing Balance
Sheet in a manner consistent with (i) the definitions of Cash and Cash
Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries set forth
herein, and (ii) the methodologies, practices and assumptions used in
preparing each Base Balance Sheet (see _Section 4.7(a)_). After the delivery
by Buyer of the calculations described in this _Section 2.3(b)_ until the
final determination of such amounts pursuant to this  _Section 2.3(b)_,
Buyer will make available to Sellers, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, all records and work papers used by Buyer or its
agents in preparing each Closing Balance Sheet, and its computation of Cash
and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_. Sellers may, within thirty (30) calendar
days after receipt of both Closing Balance Sheets, deliver a notice (an "
_Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers
calculation of the Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of
the Fastener Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. If Sellers do not deliver
an Objection Notice within such thirty (30) calendar day period, then Buyers
calculations of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of
Fastener Subsidiaries based upon each Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed to
be the Actual Closing Cash and Cash Equivalents and the Actual Closing
Working Capital of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries (as defined below). If
Sellers deliver an Objection Notice to Buyer, then Buyer and Sellers will use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreement as to the
computation of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the
Fastener Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date as soon as practicable, but if
they cannot reach a final resolution within thirty (30) calendar days after
Buyer has received the Objection Notice, Buyer and Sellers will jointly retain
an internationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to both Buyer and
Sellers (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Buyer and Sellers will direct the
Accounting Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) calendar days of
its retention and Buyer and Sellers and their respective agents will cooperate
with the Accounting Firm during its engagement. The Accounting Firm will
consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Objection Notice that
Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. In rendering its determination, the
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert in GAAP and not as an arbitrator. The
Accounting Firms determination will be based on such review as the
Accounting Firm deems necessary to make its determination, the definitions
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of the Fastener
Subsidiaries set forth in this Agreement and the methodologies, practices and
assumptions used in preparing each Base Balance Sheet (see _Section 4.7(a)_).
The determination of Cash and Cash Equivalents and Working Capital of each of

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS _

Except as set forth in the _Disclosure Letter_ , Sellers hereby represent and
warrant to Buyer as follows as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date (except to the extent made as of a specified date, in which case,
as of such specified date):

4.1  _Organization and Qualification; Fastener Subsidiaries_. Each Seller and
each Fastener Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, has all requisite corporate power and corporate authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on the Fastener Business in
all material respects as now being conducted. Each Fastener Subsidiary is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the ownership, lease or operation of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, other than where the failure to
be so duly licensed or qualified has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 4.1_ of the _Disclosure
Letter_ sets forth a list of those jurisdictions in which each Fastener
Subsidiary is qualified to do business and the jurisdiction of organization
for each Fastener Subsidiary. Neither Fastener Subsidiary owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other equity interests in or of any Person.

4.2 _Certificates of Incorporation and By-Laws; Corporate Records_. Sellers
have furnished or made available to Buyer a copy of the certificate or
articles of incorporation and the by-laws or similar organizational documents
(collectively " _Organizational Documents_ "), in each case, as amended or
restated to date, of each Fastener Subsidiary. Neither Fastener Subsidiary is
in violation in any material respect of any provision of its Organizational
Documents. Sellers have made available to Buyer for inspection its minute
books, stock record book and stock ledger of each Fastener Subsidiary.

4.3 _Capitalization_.

(a) _Section 4.3(a)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_ sets forth with respect to
each Fastener Subsidiary its authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock
or other equity interests. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
or other equity interest of each Fastener Subsidiary has been duly authorized
and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and is free of preemptive
rights. All such shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Fastener Subsidiary are owned free and clear of any and all Liens. 

(b) (i) There are no options, warrants or other rights (including registration
rights), agreements, arrangements or commitments to which TransDigm or any of
its Affiliates is a party relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or
other equity interests of either Fastener Subsidiary or obligating TransDigm
or any of its Affiliates to grant, issue or sell any shares of

 



15 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 the capital stock or other equity interests of either Fastener Subsidiary or
subjecting any such share of capital stock or other equity interest to any
right of first refusal, right of first offer, tag-along right, drag-along
right or similar right; (ii) there are no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, of TransDigm or any of its Affiliates to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of the capital stock or other equity interests
of either Fastener Subsidiary; and (iii) there are no voting trusts, proxies
or other agreements or understandings to which TransDigm or any of its
Affiliates is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock
or other equity interests of either Fastener Subsidiary.

4.4 _Authority; Enforceability_. Each Seller has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller
of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary company action
required by the Organizational Documents of the Fastener Subsidiaries,
TransDigm, Parent, US Seller and UK Seller, and no other action or corporate
proceeding on the part of Sellers or either Fastener Subsidiary will be
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each Seller. This Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of each Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general equitable principles.

4.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The execution and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement does not, and
the performance by each Seller of this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with
or violate in any material respect the Organizational Documents of Parent,
TransDigm, the US Seller, the UK Seller or either Fastener Subsidiary, (ii)
conflict with or violate in any material respect any Laws applicable to such
Seller or either Fastener Subsidiary by or to which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound or subject or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default) under any Material Contract or result in the
creation of a Lien on any of the Shares or any of the assets or properties of
either Fastener Subsidiary other than such breaches, defaults or Liens as
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, provided that such Material Adverse
Effect exclusion does not apply to any breach, default or Lien under any of
the Credit Facilities or Material Contracts identified in _Section
4.11(a)(v)_ or on _Section 4.5(a)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement
will not require any Seller or any Fastener Subsidiary to obtain any material
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or to make any filing with or
notification to (" _Consent_ "), any Governmental Entity or any third party,
except for (i) applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and any similar
foreign antitrust Laws; and (ii) as may be necessary as a result of any fact
or circumstance relating solely to Buyer.

 

4.6 _Permits; Compliance_.

 



16 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(a) Each Fastener Subsidiary is and has been since the Compliance Date, in
possession of all material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals
and orders necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
the Fastener Business in all material respects as now being conducted
(collectively, the " _Permits_ ") (other than those required under
environmental Laws, as to which no representation is given), and there is no
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge
of Sellers, threatened regarding suspension or cancellation of any such
Permits. None of the Permits will lapse, terminate or expire as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Fastener Subsidiaries have filed
all necessary reports and maintained and retained all necessary records
pertaining to the Permits other than where the failure to do so has not had,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. All
Permits were properly transferred and all necessary Consents with respect to
the Permits (including without limitation Consents to assign and Consents to
change of control) were obtained in connection with the sale of the Fastener
Subsidiaries to Sellers. 

(b) The Fastener Subsidiaries are, and have been since the Compliance Date, in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws (which compliance includes,
but is not limited to, the possession by a Fastener Subsidiary of all Permits
required under applicable Laws and compliance with the terms and conditions
thereof) applicable to either Fastener Subsidiary, including but not limited
to The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1
et seq. and other similar anti-corruption Laws of any country. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this _Section 4.6(b)_ does not apply to employee benefits
matters (which are instead addressed in _Section 4.10_), Tax matters (which
are instead addressed in _Section 4.12_), environmental matters (as to which
no representation is given), or labor matters (which are instead addressed in
_Section 4.17_).

4.7 _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) _Section 4.7(a)(i)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_ sets forth (i) the
unaudited balance sheets of Valley-Todeco as at December 31, 2009 and January
1, 2011 and of Linread as at January 1, 2011 (the January 1, 2011 balance
sheet of each of the Fastener Subsidiaries being a " _Base Balance Sheet_ ")
and (ii) the unaudited statements of income of Valley-Todeco for the twelve
month period ended January 1, 2011 and of Linread for the twelve month period
ended January 1, 2011 (the financial statements in (i) and (ii), collectively,
the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ "). The Unaudited Financial Statements
have been prepared in accordance with the books and records of the Fastener
Subsidiaries and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Fastener Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results
of operations of the Fastener Subsidiaries for the periods then ended. To
Sellers Knowledge, the Unaudited Financial Statements were prepared in
accordance with GAAP except as disclosed in the Basis of Presentation
reflected on _Section 4.7(a)(ii)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_. _Section
4.7(a)(iii)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_ sets forth the audited balance sheet
and statement of profit and loss account for Linread as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2009 (the " _Statutory Statements_ "). The Statutory
Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Linread in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).

(b) Neither the Fastener Business nor any Fastener Subsidiary has any
liabilities of any kind that would have been required to be reflected in or
reserved against on the Base Balance

 Sheet in accordance with GAAP and were not so reflected or reserved against,
other than (i) liabilities arising or incurred in the ordinary course of the
business of the Fastener Subsidiaries after the date of the Base Balance
Sheet, and (ii) liabilities incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. All liabilities reflected in or reserved against on the
Base Balance Sheet relate exclusively to the Fastener Subsidiaries and to no
other business, such as the business of Sellers, Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 4.7(b)_ will not
apply to any product liabilities, environmental liabilities or product
warranty claims and no representation is given on those matters.

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 6, 2010, (a) each
Fastener Subsidiary has conducted the Fastener Business in the ordinary
course, consistent in all material respects with past practice, (b) the
Fastener Subsidiaries have not lost any key employees, nor has TransDigm or
any of its Affiliates disposed of any material assets of the Fastener
Business, and (c) neither Fastener Subsidiary has engaged in or taken any
action which would be prohibited by _Section 6.2_ if taken after the
date hereof. Since December 6, 2010, there has not occurred, nor has there
been any change or event which has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect.

4.9 _Absence of Litigation_. (a) There is no material claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of any kind, at law or in equity (including
actions or proceedings seeking injunctive relief), by or before any
Governmental Entity or by or on behalf of any third party (" _Litigation_ ")
pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened in writing against
TransDigm or any of its Affiliates affecting any of the assets or rights of
either Fastener Subsidiary, and (b) neither TransDigm or any of its Affiliates
(excluding the Fastener Subsidiaries), with respect to the Fastener Business,
nor either of the Fastener Subsidiaries, is a party or subject to or

Entity.

4.10. _Employee Benefits; ERISA._

 

(a) _Section 4.10.(a)_ of the _Disclosure Letter_ contains a list of each
employee benefit plan including those within the meaning of Section 3.3 of
ERISA, and including but not limited to, each bonus, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option, severance or termination
pay, hospitalization or other medical, life or other insurance, disability,
vacation, supplemental unemployment benefits, profit sharing, pension or
retirement plan, program, agreement or arrangement, and each other program,
agreement or arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed to or required
to be contributed to by TransDigm or any of its Affiliates, that together
with a Fastener Subsidiary would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("
_ERISA_ ") (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), for the benefit of any Fastener
Subsidiary employee, retired employee or terminated employee whether formal or
informal (individually, a " _Plan_ " and, collectively, the " _Plans_ ").
Neither a Fastener Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has any formal plan or
commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional Plan
or modify or change any existing Plan (except as required by applicable Law)
in a way that would materially affect any Fastener Subsidiary employee,
retired employee or terminated employee of either Fastener Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate, nor has any intention to do any of the foregoing been
communicated to any Fastener Subsidiary employee, retired employee or
terminated employee of either Fastener Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate.

 



18 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(b) With respect to each of the Plans, Sellers have provided to Buyer copies
of each of the following documents: (i) a copy of the Plan (including all
amendments thereto); (ii) a copy of the prior two years of annual reports and
summary annual reports, if required under ERISA; (iii) if the Plan is funded
through a trust or any third-party funding vehicle, a copy of the trust or
other funding agreement (including all amendments thereto), the prior two
years of financial statements and copies of any reports required by the Code
or the Department of Labor and applicable rules and regulations; (iv) the
most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each Plan to the extent applicable; and (v) the most recent
summary plan descriptions with respect to each of the Plans, all of which
have been timely distributed to participants and beneficiaries.

(c) No Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and no
Plan based in the United Kingdom is subject to Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004
or Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995. No liability under Title IV of ERISA
has been incurred by either Fastener Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate that
has not been satisfied in full, except where such failure to satisfy would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, and no condition exists that presents a risk to
either Fastener Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability
under Title IV of ERISA which would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each Plan which
is an employee pension plan under ERISA meets the requirements of a qualified
plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received within the last two years
a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to
its qualification and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no event has occurred
that could reasonably be expected to result in disqualification of such Plan.
No Fastener Subsidiary is a party to a Plan unrelated to the Fastener
Business. No Fastener Subsidiary is a party to any defined benefit plan or
similar plan or any retiree medical or similar plan.

(d) Each Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with its terms
and applicable Law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws relating to Taxes. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge
of Sellers, threatened claims by or on behalf of any of the Plans, by any
employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan or otherwise involving any
such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

(e) Except for government sponsored plans and as otherwise required by
applicable Law, no Plan provides benefits, including death or medical benefits
(whether or not insured), with respect to current or former Fastener
Subsidiary employees of either Fastener Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
beyond their retirement or other termination of service.

(f) The performance by Sellers of this Agreement will not, in any respect, (i)
entitle any current or former director, officer or employee of either Fastener
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation
or any other payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation due any such director, officer or
employee.

 

(g) The requirements of COBRA, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, as
amended, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and
any amendment to each such act, and any similar provisions of state law have
been met in all material respects with

 



19 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 respect to each Plan to which they have application, as they relate to
Fastener Business employees or former employees of either Fastener Subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliate.

 

(h) All contributions and/or premiums (including all Fastener Subsidiary and
ERISA Affiliate contributions and employee salary reduction contributions)
that are due to have been paid to each such Plan have been paid to each such
Plan or accrued in accordance with the past custom and practice of the
Fastener Subsidiaries and any ERISA Affiliate.

 

(i) No Plan has been completely or partially terminated or been the subject of
a reportable event under ERISA as to which notices were or would be required
to be filed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. No proceeding by

Sheet, and (ii) Actual Closing Working Capital. All such amounts payable or

former employee of the Fastener Subsidiaries whose employment terminated prior

current or future non-fastener product offerings. Sellers and Buyer
acknowledge that the non-competition covenant granted in this _Section 6.11_

Closing set forth in Article VIII, the Closing shall nonetheless take place on
the terms specified herein and Sellers shall, until such Consent is obtained,
cooperate with Buyer, at Buyers expense, in any reasonable arrangement

in respect of Damages incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_ for any individual item or Claim, or series of related items
or Claims, in which the Damages related thereto are less than $50,000 (any

9.2(a)_ in excess of the Threshold Amount;

 

(c) the aggregate amount of all Damages for which Sellers may become liable
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ shall not in any event exceed $10,000,000 (the

liability set forth in this _Section 9.3_ shall not apply to any Damages

the part of Sellers in the negotiation or execution of, or performance under,
this Agreement; and

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Seller breaches, in any respect, the
representations set forth in _Section 4.7(b),_ Section _4.11(a)(ix)(a)_ or
_Section 4.27_ Buyer may recover Damages from such Seller pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ without application of any limitations set forth in this
_Section 9.3_ (the Qualifying Claim and the Threshold Amount), and such
Damages will not be included in calculating the Indemnity Cap.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this _Section
9.3_ shall not apply to the indemnification for Taxes under Article X.

misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set
forth in _Article V_ of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered

_Indemnitee_ "). An Indemnitee may give notice of a

 



45 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages
incurred by any other Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, pursuant to written notice of such Claim executed by an officer
of Buyer (in the case of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party) or Sellers (in
the case of a Claim by a Seller Indemnified Party) (a " _Notice of Claim_ "),
and delivered to the other party (such receiving party, the " _Indemnitor_ ")
promptly after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any potential
Claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under this _Article IX_ , but in
any event before the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth
in _Section 9.1_, arising out of or resulting from:

(i) any item subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of _Section
9.2_ or _Section 9.4_; or

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnitee of a
claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding
brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") that arises out of or results from any item subject to
indemnification pursuant to the terms of _Section 9.2_ or _9.4_.

 

(b) Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee shall contain the amount, if known,
claimed, and a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent
reasonably available to the Indemnitee), of the facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnities good faith belief
thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant
(to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee). Following delivery of
the Notice of Claim (or at the same time if the Indemnitee so elects) the
Indemnitee shall deliver copies of any demand or complaint, the amount of
Damages, the date each such item was incurred or paid or the basis for such
anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such
item is related.

 

9.6 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

(a) The Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim
to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that the failure to timely give such notice
shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder
unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is prejudiced
thereby.

(b) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the
Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim
utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, and the costs
and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such defense shall
be paid by the Indemnitor (and included in determining whether the Indemnity
Cap has been exceeded). The Indemnitee may participate (in the manner and to
the extent set forth below in _Section 9.6(c)_), through counsel of its own
choice and at its own expense, in the defense of any Third-Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnitor elects to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor
shall: (i) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable
diligence and keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material developments
in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (ii) promptly submit to the
Indemnitee copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other
similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith;
(iii) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel to confer on the conduct of the
defense thereof; and (iv) permit the Indemnitee and its counsel an opportunity
to review all legal papers to be

 



46 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 submitted prior to their submission (to the extent practical). Buyer and
Sellers will make available to each other and each others counsel and
accountants, without charge, all of its or their books and records relating
to the Third-Party Claim (subject to applicable non-disclosure restrictions
and privilege claims), and each party will render to the other party such
assistance as may be reasonably required in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection
therewith. 

(d) If the Indemnitor elects to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor
shall have the right to enter into any settlement of a Third-Party Claim on
the Indemnitees behalf without the consent of the Indemnitee; _provided_ that
(i) the Indemnitor shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of
such settlement concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii)
such settlement does not involve any injunctive or other equitable relief or
other covenant to take, or refrain from, any action, binding upon the
Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (iii) such settlement does not encumber
any of the assets of the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or otherwise
impose any restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect
any the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or the conduct of
their respective businesses, and (iv) such settlement expressly and
unconditionally releases the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations
with respect to such claim, without prejudice, and (iv) such settlement does
not involve any admission of liability or fault; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no settlement by the Indemnitor of a Third-Party Claim shall limit or
reduce (other than by application of the Indemnity Cap) the right of any
Indemnified Person to indemnity hereunder for all Damages they may incur
arising out of or resulting from the Third-Party Claim, subject to the
provisions of this _Article IX_.

9.7 _Other Indemnification Provisions_.

(a) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
reduced by the amounts of (i) any insurance proceeds actually received by the
Indemnitee in connection therewith, less the reasonable and documented costs
and expenses of obtaining such insurance proceeds (including increased
premiums) and reasonable projected increases in insurance premiums arising
because of any claim, (ii) any proceeds actually received from any other third
party in connection therewith, less the reasonable and documented costs of
obtaining such proceeds and (iii) any tax benefits that have been actually
realized by the Indemnitee arising out of indemnifiable Damages. The
Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain full
recovery under all insurance policies and rights against any other third
party with respect to any Damages. In the event that an insurance, third party
or tax benefit recovery is received by any Indemnitee with respect to any
Damages for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder for Damages
related to such Claim, then a refund equal to the amount of the recovery less
any Damages for which they were not indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.3_,
less the reasonable and documented costs and expenses of obtaining such
recovery, shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor that made or directed and
provided such indemnification payments to such Indemnitee. As used in this
_Section 9.7(a)_, "tax benefit" shall mean the Tax savings attributable to
any deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund to the Indemnitee, when
actually realized, net of any Tax detriment associated with the receipt, or
right to receive indemnification hereunder. The amount of any tax benefit
actually realized shall be equal to the actual reduction in Taxes paid in cash
determined with the applicable Tax items taken into account as compared with
the Taxes that would have been payable without the applicable Tax items.

 



47 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(b) No party shall be entitled to recover under this _Article IX_ with respect
to, and the term "Damages" shall not include, (i) losses relating to any
Claim with respect to Taxes arising as a result of any action by the
Indemnitee the effect of which is to induce a third party to assert a Third-
Party Claim or (ii) SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR ANY MEASURE OF
DAMAGES BASED ON ANY MULTIPLE OF EARNINGS OR EBITDA OR SIMILAR CONCEPT (EXCEPT
WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF SECTION 4.4), OR FOR LOSSES BASED UPON DAMAGE TO
REPUTATION THAT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE
OR BREACH THEREOF, EXCEPT IF IN ANY SUCH CASE SUCH DAMAGES ARE IN RESPECT OF
DAMAGES ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A FINAL AND
NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER, IN WHICH CASE THE RESTRICTIONS OF THIS _SECTION
9.7(b)(ii)_ SHALL NOT APPLY AND THE INDEMNITOR SHALL BE PERMITTED TO SO
RECOVER, INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES RELATING
TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of fraud
in the inducement or willful misconduct by Sellers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the foregoing limitations on
Damages shall not apply.

9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. If the Closing occurs, except as provided in _Article
X_ , a claim pursuant to _Article IX_ shall be the Indemnities sole and
exclusive remedy as to monetary damages with respect to any breach of
representation or warranty or covenant in this Agreement, or with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether such claim arises
in contract, tort, breach of warranty or any other legal or equitable theory,
and shall be limited to the rights contained in this _Article IX,_ except in
the case of fraud in the inducement or willful misconduct by Sellers in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The rights
and limitations of this _Article IX_ shall not apply to any claim for failure
to pay the Net Purchase Price - US or Net Purchase Price - UK, including any
adjustments thereto pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, and the parties shall
retain all rights and remedies available hereunder or under applicable Law for
such breach. In addition, each party shall be entitled to specific performance
for failure of the other party to perform its obligations hereunder,
except in the case of fraud in the inducement or willful misconduct by
Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
provided in this Agreement.

Straddle Period shall be determined as though the relevant Tax period ended
on and included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of Sellers and the Fastener Subsidiaries.

 

10.4 _Buyer Indemnities_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
the Fasteners Subsidiaries to indemnify Sellers and its Affiliates against
and hold them harmless from any Tax Liability to the extent attributable to
(i) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Fasteners Subsidiaries (or for
which any Fasteners Subsidiary is otherwise liable) for any Post-Closing
Tax Period, (ii) any Taxes resulting from a breach of any Tax-related
covenant contained in this Agreement by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (other
than the Fasteners Subsidiaries) or, after the applicable Closing, by any
Fasteners Subsidiary. 

10.5 _Seller Indemnities_. Sellers shall be responsible for payment of and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Fastener Subsidiaries and all
of their Affiliates from and against:

(a) all Tax Liabilities of the Fastener Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, including any such liability arising under principles of transferee or
successor liability;

(b) any Tax Liability attributable to any breach by any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller (including, prior to the Closing, the Fastener
Subsidiaries) of any covenant or agreement contained in this Article X or
representations contained in  _Section 4.12_;

(c) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which either of the Fastener Subsidiaries is or was a member
on or before the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign Law;

 



49 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(d) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Fastener Subsidiaries)
imposed on Buyer or any of the Fastener Subsidiaries as a transferee or
successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event
or transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date;

 

(e) Taxes arising as a result of any inclusion under Section 951(a) of the
Code (or any similar or corresponding provision of state or local Tax law)
with respect to either Fastener Subsidiary attributable to (A) "subpart F
income," within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code (or any similar or
corresponding provision of state or local Tax law), received or accrued on or
prior to the applicable Closing Date or (B) the holding of "United States
property," within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code (or similar or
corresponding provision of state or local Tax Law), on or prior to the
applicable Closing Date, computed, in each case, based on the amount of such
Taxes that would be payable with respect to either Fastener Subsidiary if the
relevant Tax period ended on the applicable Closing Date; and

 

(f) To the extent that Sellers do not elect to control any audit pursuant to
their rights hereunder, any and all costs (including reasonable legal and
accounting fees) that Buyer or any Fastener Subsidiary incurs in connection
with such audit.

10.6 _Survival_. The indemnification for Taxes set forth in this _Article X_
shall survive the Closing until fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, Article IX will
not apply in any respect with regard to the indemnification for Taxes set
forth in this Article X, including without limitation the limitations on
Sellers indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 9.3_.

 

10.7 _Treatment of Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer,
the Fastener Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates after the
Closing, and any amounts credited or offset against Taxes of Buyer, the
Fastener Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing
that are actually realized by such parties, that in each case relate to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods of the Fastener Subsidiaries shall be for the account of
Sellers. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of
Taxes of the Fastener Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be
for the account of Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds,
credits or offsets of Taxes of the Fastener Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period shall be equitably apportioned between Sellers and Buyer within forty-
five (45) days of the later of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date the
refund, credit or offset is identified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all net
operating losses of the Fastener Subsidiaries shall be for the account of the
Fastener Subsidiaries and the Buyer and not for the account of the Sellers,
and the Buyer shall have no obligation to pay to Sellers any amount with
respect to the Fastener Subsidiaries net operating losses. Sellers and their
Affiliates shall not be obligated to forego any carryback of net operating
losses incurred by the Fastener Subsidiaries during a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

10.8 _Termination of Tax Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreement between
Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Fastener Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and the Fastener Subsidiaries, on the other hand shall be
terminated on or before the Closing Date and will have no further effect for
any taxable year.

10.9 _Cooperation in Preparation of Tax Returns_. All Tax Returns addressed in
this _Article X_ shall be prepared in accordance with the methodology used by
Sellers and the Fastener Subsidiaries in prior taxable years. Sellers and
Buyer shall each provide the other with such

 



50 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 assistance as may be reasonably requested (including making employees
reasonably available to provide information or testimony) in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return or the determination of Liability for Taxes
with respect to the Fastener Subsidiaries or the Business (including those
Liabilities as may arise relating to any audits, disputes, administration,
judicial or other proceeding relating to Taxes). Sellers and Buyer shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in preparing and
pursuing any claims for refunds or credits of income Taxes (including refunds)
of the Fastener Subsidiaries. Sellers and Buyer each shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, retain until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers, accounting
records and other records that are owned by such Person immediately after the
Closing Date and that relate to the Fastener Subsidiaries or the Business;
after the end of such period, before disposing of any such Tax Returns,
schedules, work papers or other records, each shall give notice to such effect
to the other, and shall give the other, at the others cost and expense, a
reasonable opportunity to remove and retain all or any part of such Tax
Returns, schedules, work papers or other records as the other may select.

10.10 _Notice of Tax Disputes and Audits_. If any Taxing Authority informs
Sellers or Buyer of any notice of a proposed audit, claim, assessment or other
dispute concerning an amount of Taxes with respect to which the other party
may incur Liability hereunder, the party so informed shall promptly notify the
other party of such matter. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known) describing any asserted Tax Liability in reasonable detail
and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other documents received
from any Taxing Authority with respect to such matter. If a party has
knowledge of an asserted Tax Liability with respect to a matter for which it
is to be indemnified hereunder and such party fails to provide the
indemnifying party prompt notice of such asserted Tax Liability, (i) if the
indemnifying party is precluded from contesting the asserted Tax Liability in
any forum as a result of the failure to give prompt notice and could have
asserted in good faith that the Tax Liability should be reduced, the
indemnifying party shall have no obligation to indemnify the indemnified party
for the amount of such reduction; and (ii) if the indemnifying party is not
precluded from contesting the asserted Tax Liability in any forum, but such
failure to provide prompt notice results in a monetary detriment to the
indemnifying party, then any amount which the indemnifying party is otherwise
required to pay to or on behalf of the indemnified party pursuant to this
Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

 

10.11 _Control of Tax Disputes and Audits_. The party responsible under this
_Article X_ for filing the Tax Returns applicable to the relevant Tax shall
control any audits, disputes, administrative, judicial or other proceedings
related to Taxes with respect to which either party may incur Liability
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, if an adverse determination may
result in each party having responsibility for an amount of Taxes under this
_Article X_ , each party shall be entitled to fully participate in that
portion of the proceedings relating to the Taxes with respect to which it may
incur liability hereunder. For purposes of this _Article X_ the term
"participation" shall include (i) participation in conferences, meetings or
proceedings with any Taxing Authority, the subject matter of which includes an
item for which such party may have liability hereunder, (ii) participation in
appearances before any court or tribunal, the subject matter of which includes
an item for which a party may have liability hereunder, and (iii) with respect
to the matters described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), participation
in the submission and

 



51 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 determination of the content of the documentation, protests, memorandum of
fact and law, briefs, and the conduct of oral arguments and presentations.

 

10.12 _Tax Elections_. Sellers shall not make or change any Tax elections or
file for any change in any method of accounting with the IRS with respect to
the Fastener Subsidiaries without the prior consent of Buyer if such election
or change would have a material adverse impact on Buyer or the Fastener
Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

10.13 _Section 338 Election_

(a) At Buyers option Buyer and US Seller shall make an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the IRC with respect to the sale of the Valley-Todeco Shares,
and Buyer shall make an election under Section 338(g) of the IRC with respect
to the Linread Shares to the extent permissible under applicable Treasury
regulations or other applicable law. Any such election shall be referred to
herein as a " _Section 338 Election_ ". The parties shall cooperate to
prepare and timely file Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or any successor
form) and any other forms required by applicable law necessary to make the
Section 338 Election.

 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms and
documents required in connection with the Section 338 Elections. For the
purpose of making the Section 338 Election for Valley Todeco, on or before the
Closing Date Buyer and US Seller each shall execute two copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form 8023 (or successor form) and any other forms required by
applicable law. Sellers shall execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to
Buyer such additional documents or forms as are reasonably requested to
complete properly the Section 338 Elections at least 30 days prior to the
date such Section 338 Elections is required to be filed. Each Seller shall
include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax item resulting from
each such Section 338 Election on its Tax Return to the extent required by
applicable law. Each Seller shall also be responsible for the payment of any
Tax that is attributable to the making of each such Section 338 Election,
including any federal, state or local Tax and will indemnify and hold Buyer
and its Affiliates harmless from any adverse consequences arising out of any
failure to pay such Tax. The parties intend for each such Section 338 Election
to be effective, if possible, for state (as well as federal and, to the extent
applicable, non-U.S.) income Tax purposes, and they shall timely execute and
file any documents that may be required under any applicable law for such
election (or any corresponding election(s) allowable under applicable law) to
be effective for state income Tax purposes.

 

(c) Buyer and Sellers shall mutually agree on allocations of (i) the Purchase
Price - US (and all other capitalized costs of Valley-Todeco) among the
assets of Valley-Todeco; and (ii) the Purchase Price - UK (and all other
capitalized costs of Linread) among the assets of Linread (the final
allocation schedules, whether agreed upon or determined in accordance
with the following sentence, the " _Allocation Schedules_ ") not later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date Balance Sheet for each Fastener
Subsidiary is completed. Buyer and Sellers agree that the portion of the
Purchase Price - US and Purchase Price - UK allocated to the assets and the
liabilities of each Fastener Subsidiary (plus other relevant items) will be
allocated for tax purposes in a manner consistent with IRC Section 338 and
Section 1060 and the Treasury regulations thereunder. If Sellers and Buyer
cannot agree to such allocations within such sixty (60) day period, each party
may prepare allocations on its own behalf for all tax purposes and in all
filings, declarations and reports with the IRS and corresponding UK
authority. Except to the

 



52 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 extent the proviso in the previous sentence applies, Buyer and Sellers will
file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594, amended
Tax Returns, claims for refund and Form 8883) in a manner consistent with
such Allocation Schedules; provided, however, that (i) the deemed purchase
price of the assets may differ from the deemed sales price to the extent
necessary to reflect the inclusion in the total deemed purchase price of
Buyers transaction costs not included in the total deemed sales price and
(ii) the amount realized upon the deemed sale of assets may differ from the
deemed sales price to reflect transaction costs that reduce the
amount realized for federal income tax purposes.

ARTICLE XI

 

 _TERMINATION_

11.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated by giving written
notice at any time prior to the Closing as follows:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers;

(b) by either Buyer or Sellers, if there shall be any order which is final and
nonappealable preventing the performance by Buyer or Sellers of their
respective obligations under this Agreement; 

(c) by Buyer (i) at any time after the Outside Date if the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur at the Closing shall not have been consummated
for any reason other than the failure of Buyer to comply with any covenant or
agreement of Buyer, or (ii) at any time, if Sellers shall have breached or
violated any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
this Agreement in a manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or, _Section 8.2(b)_ or
_Section 8.2(c)_ or _Section 8.2(d)_ or  _Section 8.2(e)_ and (except in
the case of a breach of the obligation to close within two (2) Business Days
of the date contemplated in _Section 3.1_, in which case such two (2)
Business Day period shall apply) such breach or violation shall not have been
cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof has been given by
Buyer to Sellers;

(d) by Sellers, (i) at any time after the Outside Date if the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur at the Closing shall not have been consummated
for any reason other than the failure of Sellers to comply with any covenant
or agreement of Sellers, or (ii) at any time, if Buyer shall have breached or
violated any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this
Agreement in a manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions
to Closing set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_, and (except in
the case of a breach of the obligation to close within two (2) Business Days
of the date contemplated in _Section 3.1_, in which case such two (2)
Business Day period shall apply) such breach or violation shall not have been
cured within ten (10) days after notice thereof has been given by Sellers to
Buyer; or

 

(e) by either Buyer or Sellers, if the other party shall have failed to
consummate the Closing no later than three (3) Business Days after the date
on which the Closing should have occurred despite all of the conditions set
forth in Article VIII having been satisfied.

11.2  _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in _Section 6.5_, in the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, 

 



53 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 there shall be no liability on the part of Buyer or Sellers or any of their
respective partners, officers, directors, Subsidiaries, or Affiliates to any
other party and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease,
except that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for
any breach of this Agreement.

12.2 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument signed by Buyer and Sellers.

12.3  _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer and Sellers may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party or parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party or parties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the
other party or parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.

12.4 _Headings_. The headings and captions contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

12.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or any
portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the remaining portion thereof, shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any such term
or other provision, or any portion thereof, is invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated to the fullest extent possible.

12.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Transition Services
Agreement, Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto and the _Disclosure Letter_
) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, between or among the parties, or any of them, with respect
to the subject matter hereof.

 

12.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may assign any of its rights hereunder and
may delegate any of its obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer, but
no such assignment or delegation shall relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder.

 



55 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

12.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer
on any person other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement, including any third-party beneficiary rights,
except that current or former directors and officers of the Fastener
Subsidiaries shall be third party beneficiaries of  _Section 6.6_.

12.9 _Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay
on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

 

12.10 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges that money
damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any
breach of this Agreement by such party and that any such breach would cause
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, irreparable harm.
Accordingly, each party hereto also agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such party, Buyer,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or other security,
including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific performance. Any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

12.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, its
rules of conflict of laws notwithstanding. Each party hereby agrees and
consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of
Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal
court having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County,
Delaware, in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereby
irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such suit,
action or proceeding by the delivery of such process to such party at the
address and in the manner provided in  _Section 12.1_ hereof. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, or if the Court of
Chancery lacks jurisdiction over such dispute, in any state or federal court
having jurisdiction over the matter situated in New Castle County, Delaware,
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



56 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.11(b)_.

 

12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, including by means of facsimile, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

12.13  _Interpretation_. As used in this Agreement, (x) the term "including"
means "including, without limitation" and "including, but not limited to," (y)
the word "or" is not exclusive, unless the context otherwise requires. All
references in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States
Dollars.

12.14  _Costs of Dispute_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event of any dispute between the parties arising under this
Agreement, the party prevailing in that dispute shall be entitled to receive
from the other party reimbursement for its attorneys fees, court costs,
expert witness fees and other similar costs.

12.15 _Fees, Expenses and Other Payments_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including costs of their
respective attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, brokers and other
representatives. All actual unpaid Company Fees and Expenses shall be paid by
TransDigm and its Affiliates (excluding the Fastener Subsidiaries) after the
Closing, to the parties to whom such actual unpaid Company Fees and
Expenses are payable. In no event shall Buyer, the Fastener Business or any
Fastener Subsidiary be liable for such fees and expenses.

12.16 _Certain Legal Representation Matters_.

In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, TransDigm and
its Affiliates (excluding the Fastener Subsidiaries) shall have the right, at
their election, to retain the firm of Baker and Hostetler LLP (the " _Retained
Firm_ ") to represent TransDigm or any of its Affiliates (excluding

 



57 _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 the Fastener Subsidiaries) in such matter, and Buyer hereby irrevocably
consents to, and waives any conflict associated with, any such representation
in any such matter. Each of Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
Retained Firm has acted as counsel for TransDigm (and its Affiliates,
including the Fastener Subsidiaries) and in connection with this Agreement.
The parties agree that the fact that the Retained Firm has
represented Sellers and the Fastener Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall
not prevent the Retained Firm from representing Sellers (or any of their
Affiliates, excluding the Fastener Subsidiaries) in connection with any
matters involving this Agreement, including any disputes between any of the
parties hereto that may arise after the Closing; provided, however, Buyer and
Sellers further agree that the Fastener Subsidiaries are the client of the
Retained Firm for the purposes of the attorney-client privilege, and none of
TransDigm or its Affiliates (not including the Fastener Subsidiaries) will
invoke the attorney-client privilege to prevent the Fastener Subsidiaries from
using, after the Closing, any privileged communications or advice given by
the Retained Firm to the Fastener Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Buyer and
Sellers hereby waive any actual or potential conflict of interest relating to
the Retained Firms representation of Sellers in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (but nothing herein shall require Buyer, the Fastener
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates to consent to the representation of Sellers
and their Affiliates by the Retained Firm if the Retained Firms conflict
arises out of any matter other than the representation of the Sellers or the
Fastener Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time).
