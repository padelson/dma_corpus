Agreement and Plan of Merger

  

  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of March 21, 2011 by and among Shutterfly, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Horsley Acquisition Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Horsley Acquisition Sub
II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Sister Sub"), Tiny Prints, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and the Stockholder Representative, for the purposes of Section
6.6 hereof only. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings set forth in Article 8.

  

  

Recitals

  

  

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the "Merger")
of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), with the
Company to be the surviving entity of the Merger. Immediately following the
Effective Time of the Merger, in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL,
Parent will cause the Company to merge with and into Sister Sub, with Sister
Sub surviving such Subsequent Merger.

  

  

B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has unanimously
(i) determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and the Stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, the Merger, the Escrow Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) recommended that the Stockholders
adopt and approve this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and approve the Merger.

  

  

C. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent,
Merger Sub and Sister Sub and as a condition and inducement to Parent's,
Merger Sub's and Sister Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
Company has delivered to Parent (a) Equity Consideration Lock-Up Agreements,
executed by each Stockholder (other than the Founders) that is to receive
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and Founder Lock-Up Agreements, executed by
each of the Founders, which Equity Consideration Lock-Up Agreements and
Founder Lock-Up Agreements shall include, among other provisions, certain
transfer restrictions as well as investment representations and warranties
required to be given by each Stockholder to enable Parent to reasonably
establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
Regulation D thereunder for the issuance of such Parent Common Stock, and (b)
written consents from each of the Series 1 Common Stockholders, the Series 2
Common Stockholders and the Series A Preferred Stockholders, representing at
least the minimum number of votes required by the DGCL and the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation (i) necessary to approve this Agreement, the
Merger, the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the allocation of the Adjusted Net Base Amount and the
distribution thereof to the Stockholders, and (ii) which include, effective as
of the Closing Date, an irrevocable limited waiver, release and discharge of
Parent, Company, Merger Sub, Sister Sub, the Transitory Surviving Corporation
and the Surviving Company, and their respective Affiliates as provided for
therein, the form of such stockholder consent is attached hereto as Exhibit A
(each, a "Stockholder Consent" and collectively, the "Stockholder Consents").

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

D. To induce Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Sub to enter into this Agreement,
each of the Founders has concurrently herewith entered into the Specified
Employee Offer Package Agreements, each effective as of the Closing, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibits B-1, B-2 and B-3, respectively, which
includes (A) an offer letter, (B) an irrevocable limited waiver, release and
discharge of the Company and its Affiliates as provided for therein, (C) a
Proprietary Information Agreement, and (D), a Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreement providing for non-competition and non-solicitation
obligations of the Founders from and after the Closing for a two (2) year
period as provided therein ((A) through (D) together, the "Specified Employee
Offer Package Agreements").

  

  

E. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger constitute an integrated plan described in Rev. Rul.
2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 (the "Integrated Transaction").

  

  

F. In the event that the Integrated Transaction qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, then the parties intend for this Agreement to constitute a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes.

  

  

G. In the event that the Integrated Transaction does not qualify as a
reorganization, the parties intend to treat the Merger and the Subsequent
Merger as separate transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes not
subject to the "integration doctrine" pursuant to Ruling 90-95, 1990-2 C.B.
67.

  

  

Now, Therefore, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, by virtue of
the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Sister Sub or any Stockholder (except as
expressly provided herein), the following shall occur at the Effective Time of
the Merger:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares), in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, shall be cancelled
and converted into and represent the right to receive, in accordance with and
subject to the Merger Participation Provisions, (1) cash in an amount equal to
(w) the Series A Per Share Closing Cash Amount, plus (x) the Series A Per
Share Escrow Cash Amount, if any, and (2) Parent Common Stock in an amount
equal to (y) the Series A Per Share Closing Stock Amount, plus (z) the Series
A Per Share Escrow Stock Amount, if any (collectively, the "Per Share
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration"). The receipt of the Per Share Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL shall be deemed to
constitute full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Series A

Agreement and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, shall be cancelled
and converted into and represent the right to receive, in accordance with and
subject to the Merger Participation Provisions, (1) cash in an amount equal to

Escrow Cash Amount, if any, and (2) Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to
(y) the Common Per Share Closing Stock Amount, plus (z) the Common Per Share
Escrow Stock Amount, if any (collectively, the "Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration"). The receipt of the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL shall be deemed to constitute full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Share Limit; Cash Limit. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if at any time the Adjusted Net Base Amount exceeds the Gross Merger
Consideration (such amount, the "Incremental Amount"), then Parent will not be
required to (i) issue any shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of an amount
that, when taken together with all shares of Parent Common Stock that Parent
is to issue (or has issued) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any shares of Parent Common Stock that Parent
will subsequently issue (or has issued) in connection with any Company Equity
Rights assumed by Parent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), would
reasonably be expected to require, in Parent's good faith discretion following
consultation with outside securities counsel, the prior approval of Parent's
stockholders pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5635 (the "Parent Share Limit"), and/or
(ii) pay any cash that, when taken together with all cash amounts that Parent
will pay (or has paid) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, would
reasonably be expected to exceed the Parent Cash Cap. In the event that this
Section 1.9(c) operates to limit the amount of Parent Common Stock that a
Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement because the Parent Share Limit would be exceeded, then Parent
shall substitute cash in an amount that equals the value of the Parent Common
Stock (valued at the Parent Share Price) in excess of the Parent Share Limit
("Substitute Cash"); provided, however, in no event shall the amount of
Substitute Cash, when taken together with all other cash amounts that Parent
will pay (or has paid) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, exceed the
Parent Cash Cap; provided further that in no event shall the amount of
Substitute Cash, when taken together with all other cash amounts that Parent
will pay (or has paid) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the
Stockholders prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" under
the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code unless the Stockholder
Representative consents otherwise in writing pursuant to the Company Election.
In the event that the Incremental Amount would result in (x) the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock in excess of the Parent Share Limit, and/or (y)
the payment of cash in excess of the Parent Cash Cap, then the Incremental
Amount shall be reduced to an amount that does not result in the Parent Share
Limit and the Parent Cash Cap being exceeded and all calculations and formulas
provided for in this Agreement shall be adjusted, or reduced, as applicable,
to achieve such result.

  

  

(d) No Further Registration of Transfer. There shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Transitory Surviving
Corporation, or the Surviving Company, of Series A Preferred Stock or Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger. If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates are
presented to the Transitory Surviving Corporation, or the Surviving Company,
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Section 1.9 and Section 1.15.

  

  

(e) Company Options. Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a
"Company Option") that is outstanding as of the Effective Time of the Merger,
to the extent such Company Option is not then exercised, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be, conditioned upon consummation of the Merger,
assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase Parent Common Stock
(each, a "Parent Option"), in an amount and at an exercise price as determined
in accordance with this Section 1.9(e). Each Company Option so assumed and
converted by Parent in accordance with this Agreement shall be subject to, and
exercisable and vested on, the same terms and conditions applicable to such
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
except that each assumed Company Option shall constitute a Parent Option (1)
to acquire that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, by (ii) the Option/RSU
Exchange Ratio; and (2) with an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
by (ii) the Option/RSU Exchange Ratio.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Company RSUs. Each restricted stock unit to receive shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU") that is outstanding as of the Effective
Time of the Merger, whether or not then vested, shall be, conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger, assumed by Parent and converted into the right to
receive that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a "Parent
RSU"), in an amount as determined in accordance with this Section 1.9(f). Each
Company RSU so assumed and converted by Parent in accordance with this
Agreement shall be subject to, and vested on, the same terms and conditions
applicable to such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, except that each assumed Company RSU shall constitute a Parent
RSU to acquire that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, by (ii) the Option/RSU
Exchange Ratio.

  

  

(g) Form S-8. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but not later
than five (5) Business Days after receiving the Company's financial
statements, and auditor consent, necessary to permit Parent to file the S-8
Registration Statement), Parent shall file an appropriate Registration
Statement on Form S-8 (to the extent that such form is available to a holder
of Parent Options or Parent RSUs) with respect to the offering of the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Parent Options and Parent RSUs (the
"S-8 Registration Statement") and shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such S-8 Registration Statement
thereafter for so long as any of such Parent Options or Parent RSUs remain
outstanding. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the provisions of Sections 1.9(e)-(f) without paying
any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of Parent,
Merger Sub, Sister Sub, the Company, the Transitory Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates. It is the intention
of the parties hereto that each Company Option so assumed by Parent shall
qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined
in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the
Code and to the extent such Company Option qualified as an incentive stock
option prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(h) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Transitory Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Transitory Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Conversion and Exchange of Transitory Surviving Corporation Securities in
the Subsequent Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
by virtue of the Subsequent Merger and without the need for any further action
on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Sister Sub or any Stockholder,
at the Effective Time of the Subsequent Merger, the one issued and outstanding
share of common stock of the Transitory Surviving Corporation, shall be
cancelled and converted into and represent one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

  

  

(j) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share of Parent Common Stock, each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled
to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Sections
1.9(a)-(b), computed after aggregating all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by such Stockholder pursuant to Sections 1.9(a)-(b) with respect to a
particular Certificate, shall instead receive from Parent, upon surrender of
such Stockholder's Certificate pursuant to Section 1.15 hereof, an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product of such fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by Parent Share Price (the "Fractional
Share Cash Amount").

  

  

1.10 Company Warrants. To the extent that any Company Warrant is not converted
into Company Common Stock on or before the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Company shall cause such Company Warrant to be terminated prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, pursuant to the form of warrant termination
agreement attached hereto as Exhibit K (the "Warrant Termination Agreement"),
and any cost incurred in connection with such termination, including the
redemption cost in connection with the termination of the Company Warrants,
shall be paid by the Company. No Company Warrants shall survive the Effective
Time of the Merger.

  

  

1.11 Tax Treatment. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger and the Subsequent Merger constitute an "Integrated Transaction."
In the event that the Integrated Transaction qualifies as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, then the parties intend for this Agreement to
constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. In the event that the
Integrated Transaction does not qualify as a reorganization, the parties
intend to treat the Merger and the Subsequent Merger as separate transactions
for U.S. federal income tax purposes not subject to the "integration doctrine"
pursuant to Ruling 90-95, 1990-2 C.B. 67.

  

  

1.12 Withholding Rights; Deductions from Consideration. Parent, the Transitory
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Adjusted Net Base Amount payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Transitory
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company are required to deduct and
withhold therefrom under any applicable Tax provision. To the extent that
amounts are deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid and delivered to the
Stockholders or holders of Company Options in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

1.13 Escrow. On the Closing Date and pursuant to the terms of the escrow
agreement in the form of Exhibit E (the "Escrow Agreement"), Parent will
withhold (i) the Escrow Cash, and (ii) the Escrow Stock (the Escrow Cash and
the Escrow Stock being collectively referred to as the "Escrow Amount"), and
deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") to be
held in trust by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (the "Escrow Agent" and
also the "Exchange Agent") . The Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow
Account will be released from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount will be available as a source of
funding to the Indemnified Parties for any Losses for which they are entitled
to be indemnified pursuant to Article 6. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement:

  

  

(a) The shares of Escrow Stock will be issued to, and registered in, book
entry form pursuant to a restricted CUSIP number in an account in the name of
each Stockholder in proportion to each Stockholder's Pro Rata Share, and for
all purposes under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement each share of
Escrow Stock shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price.
Each Stockholder shall be entitled to vote his, her or its shares in the
escrow while such shares are in the escrow.

  

  

(b) Any recovery by Parent of Losses from the Escrow Amount shall be made from
the Escrow Stock and Escrow Cash in the same proportion that the Escrow Stock
and the Escrow Cash respectively bear to the Escrow Amount (with each share of
Escrow Stock being deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price).

  

  

(c) On the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (or, if such
date is not a Business Day, then the first Business Day thereafter) (the
"Escrow Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release to the Exchange Agent
for distribution to the Stockholders, in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares, the Escrow Funds (as such term is defined in the Escrow
Agreement) minus (A) any Pending Claims Amount (as such term is defined in the
Escrow Agreement) as of the Claim Termination Date, minus (B) the aggregate
Claimed Escrow Amounts (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement) paid
to Parent, on behalf of any Indemnified Party, pursuant to this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement through the Claim Termination Date, and minus (C) the
aggregate outstanding Claimed Escrow Amounts set forth in any Claim
Certificates, which have not been paid to Parent, or contested by the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, as
of the Claim Termination Date; plus (D) the Escrow Earnings (as such term is
defined in the Escrow Agreement).

1.14 Adjustments for Capital Changes. In the event of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, all references in this Agreement to
specified numbers of shares affected thereby, and all calculations provided
for that are based upon numbers of shares affected thereby, shall be equitably
adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change.

  

  

1.15 Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time of the Merger, but in any event no later than two (2) Business
Days after the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send to each Stockholder a letter of transmittal in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F (the "Letter of Transmittal") for use in surrendering to
the Company certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger evidenced Company Common Stock (the "Common Certificates") or Series A
Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Certificates", and together with the Common
Certificates, the "Certificates"), as applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 1.15, each (A) Common Certificate (other than
Common Certificates representing Dissenting Shares), shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time of the Merger to represent only the right to
receive upon the surrender of such Common Certificate, the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of each share of such Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, and (B) Preferred Certificate (other than Preferred
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares), shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time of the Merger to represent only the right to receive
upon the surrender of such Preferred Certificate, the Per Share Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in
respect of each share of such Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. Other than with respect to interest that accrues
on the Escrow Account, no interest shall be paid or will accrue on any of the
cash merger consideration payable to the Stockholders. As it relates to
holders of (A) Company Common Stock, upon the surrender of Common Certificates
or, in the absence thereof, Affidavits (as defined below), representing
Company Common Stock and the delivery of an executed Letter of Transmittal to
Parent, each Stockholder shall be paid for each share of Company Common Stock
represented by such Common Certificates, without interest thereon, the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration, and (B) Series A Preferred Stock,
upon the surrender of Preferred Certificates or, in the absence thereof,
Affidavits (as defined below), representing Series A Preferred Stock and the
delivery of an executed Letter of Transmittal to Parent, each Stockholder
shall be paid for each share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such
Preferred Certificates, without interest thereon, the Per Share Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration, by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days) thereafter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall pay, or cause the Exchange Agent to pay, immediately
following the Effective Time of Merger, to each Stockholder, the Per Share
Common Stock Merger Consideration or Per Share Preferred Stock Merger
Consideration, as applicable, payable to such Stockholder hereunder, if such
Stockholder has delivered to the Exchange Agent properly executed Letter(s) of
Transmittal and the Certificates evidencing such shares of Company Common
Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no payment of the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or the
Per Share Preferred Stock Merger Consideration shall be made to any
Stockholder who does not present the applicable Certificates for cancellation
representing shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, or,
in the alternative, an affidavit and bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
stating that any of such Certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed and that
such holder will indemnify and hold Parent, the Transitory Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Company, and each of their respective officers,
directors and agents harmless from any costs, expenses and damages that may be
incurred if such certificates are later produced (an "Affidavit").

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

1.16 No Liability for Compliance with Escheat Laws. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Transitory Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company, or any party hereto shall be liable for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Exemption from Registration.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Stockholders made to Parent in the Equity Consideration Lock-Up Agreements,
the Founder Lock-Up Agreements and Letters of Transmittal, and assuming
neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, have taken any action to
prevent the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger from
being exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, or any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger are to be issued pursuant to
Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"); provided, however, that in the event that that Parent determines, in
its good faith discretion following consultation with outside securities
counsel, that Regulation D, or, in Parent's sole discretion, another
applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,
is not available for such issuance, each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to promptly amend this Agreement, as appropriate, to provide for the
registration of the Parent Common Stock issuance contemplated by this
Agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the appropriate form
of registration statement and make appropriate conforming changes throughout
this Agreement (e.g., specifying that effectiveness of such registration
statement would be a condition to closing in lieu of the condition to closing
currently set forth in Section 5.2(n)).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) All shares of Closing Stock and Escrow Stock (if certificated) issued
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall bear the restrictive securities
legend set forth in the Letter of Transmittal. In addition, each Stockholder's
account reflecting the book entry of Escrow Stock applicable to such
Stockholder shall contain a notation that such shares of Escrow Stock are
subject to the restrictive securities legend set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal and shall be issued pursuant to a restricted CUSIP number
designated specifically for the Escrow Stock. Any such legends on Escrow Stock
will be removed upon request of the Stockholder thereof after the time such
Escrow Stock is no longer subject to the restrictions imposed by the Escrow
Agreement or applicable securities Laws.

  

  

1.18 Working Capital Adjustment; Net Cash/Net Debt Adjustment.

  

  

(a) The Company shall deliver the Closing Report, comprised of a Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement and a Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt Statement,
to Parent on the Closing Date and shall deliver a draft of the Closing Report
(with such supporting documentation or data of the Company as Parent may
reasonably request) (the "Draft Report") at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. Each of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement
and the Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt Statement shall be accompanied by the
Company's reasonable supporting documentation, setting forth a reasonably
specific and detailed description of its calculations and rationale for the
determination of (i) the Net Working Capital, and (ii) the Net Cash/Net Debt.
From the delivery of the Draft Report until the Closing Date, Parent shall
have the right to review the Draft Report and such supporting documentation or
data of the Company as Parent may reasonably request. If Parent does not agree
with the Net Working Capital and/or the Net Cash/Net Debt set forth in the
Draft Report, the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to mutually
agree on, as applicable, an acceptable (i) Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement and Net Working Capital, and/or (ii) Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt
Statement and Net Cash/Net Debt, and the Company and Parent shall each
consider in good faith any proposed comments or changes that the other party
may reasonably suggest; provided, however, that the inclusion of, or the
failure to include, in, as applicable (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement or the Net Working Capital, and/or (ii) the Closing Date Net
Cash/Net Debt Statement or the Net Cash/Net Debt, any changes proposed by
Parent, shall not limit or otherwise affect Parent's remedies under this
Agreement, including Parent's right to dispute such amount pursuant to the
Notice of Objection, or constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of the accuracy
of either, as applicable (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or
the Net Working Capital, and/or (ii) Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt Statement
or the Net Cash/Net Debt.

  

  

(b) If pursuant to the terms of Section 1.18(a) it is determined that:

  

  

(i) the Net Working Capital as reflected on the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement is less than the Net Working Capital Target (such difference
shall be referred to herein as the "Working Capital Shortfall"), then at
Closing, the calculation of the Adjusted Net Base Amount shall take into
account such Working Capital Shortfall; and/or

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) the Net Cash/Net Debt as reflected on the Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt
Statement is a negative amount (e.g., there is more debt than cash) (the "Net
Cash/Net Debt Negative Amount"), then at Closing, the calculation of the
Adjusted Net Base Amount shall take into account such Net Cash/Net Debt
Negative Amount; and/or

  

  

(iii) the Net Working Capital as reflected on the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement exceeds the Net Working Capital Target (such difference
shall be referred to herein as the "Working Capital Surplus"), then at
Closing, the calculation of the Adjusted Net Base Amount shall take into
account such Working Capital Surplus; and/or

  

  

(iv) the Net Cash/Net Debt as reflected on the Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt
Statement is a positive amount (e.g., there is more cash than debt) (the "Net
Cash/Net Debt Positive Amount"), then at Closing, the calculation of the
Adjusted Net Base Amount shall take into account such Net Cash/Net Debt
Positive Amount.

  

  

(c) Parent shall have sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, and, in the
event of a Good Faith Correction Notice, sixty (60) days following Parent's
receipt of any such Good Faith Correction Notice, to notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing (the "Notice of Objection") of any good faith
objections to the calculation of the Net Working Capital and/or the Net
Cash/Net Debt set forth in the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or
the Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt Statement (as such amounts may be modified
pursuant to a Good Faith Correction Notice), as applicable, setting forth a
reasonably specific and detailed description of its objections and the dollar
amount of each objection (including calculations and rationale for the
objection), and shall be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation.
If Parent objects to the calculation of the Net Working Capital and/or the Net
Cash/Net Debt set forth in the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or
the Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt Statement (as such amounts may be modified
pursuant to a Good Faith Correction Notice), as applicable, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall attempt to resolve any such objections within
thirty (30) days of the receipt by Stockholder Representative of the Notice of
Objection. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve
any such dispute within such thirty (30) day period, Parent or the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to submit the dispute to the Settling
Audit Firm. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, provide reasonable cooperation to the Settling Audit
Firm. The Settling Audit Firm shall (i) act in its capacity as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only those matters as to which there is a
dispute between the parties (meaning for example, that its final determination
of Net Working Capital and/or the Net Cash/Net Debt, as applicable, will be
within (and not outside) the upper and lower bounds set forth by the parties
for such amounts), and (iii) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding
any such dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment and provide a
written explanation of its decision. In the event that Parent submits any
dispute to the Settling Audit Firm, each of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative may submit a "position paper" to the Settling Audit Firm
setting forth the position of such party with respect to such dispute, to be
considered by the Settling Audit Firm as it deems fit. The expenses relating
to the engagement of the Settling Audit Firm shall be paid by either Parent or
the Stockholders, as the case may be, whose final proposed calculation of the
Net Working Capital and/or the Net Cash/Net Debt, as applicable, prior to the
submission of this matter to the Settling Audit Firm was further from the Net
Working Capital and/or the Net Cash/Net Debt, as applicable, or, if both the
Net Working Capital and the Net Cash/Net Debt are being disputed, the
determination will be based made on whose final proposed calculation, on a net
basis, was further from the from the combined Net Working Capital and the Net
Cash/Net Debt, in all cases, as determined by the Settling Audit Firm;
provided, however, that in the event the Stockholders are responsible for the
Settling Audit Firm expenses, the parties agree that Parent shall pay such
Settling Audit Firm expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be
deemed a Loss, which shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount, including
not counting towards the Threshold Amount) from the Escrow Amount, in the same
proportion as the Escrow Stock and the Escrow Cash respectively bear to the
Escrow Account (with each share of Escrow Stock being deemed to have a value
equal to the Parent Share Price).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If Parent does not deliver a Notice of Objection in accordance with
Section 1.18(c) hereof (i.e., within the latest applicable sixty (60) day
period), the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement and the Closing Date
Net Cash/Net Debt Statement (as such amounts may be modified pursuant to a
Good Faith Correction Notice) shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of
the parties to this Agreement. If Parent delivers a Notice of Objection in
accordance with the provisions above and Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are able to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, then (i)
the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, together with the Company's
calculation of the Net Working Capital, reflected thereon, to the extent
modified by mutual agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to have been
accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement, and/or (ii) the Net Cash/Net
Debt Statement, together with the Company's calculation of the Net Cash/Net
Debt, reflected thereon, to the extent modified by mutual agreement of such
parties, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this
Agreement. In the event that the parties' mutually agreed upon modification of
(i) the Net Working Capital results in a reduction of the Net Working Capital
(the "Working Capital Reduction"), and/or (ii) the Net Cash/Net Debt resulting
in a reduction of the Net Cash/Net Debt (the "Net Cash/Net Debt Reduction"),
Parent shall, in each case, be entitled to recover an amount equal to such
Working Capital Reduction and/or Net Cash/Net Debt Reduction from the Escrow
Account (without regard to the Threshold Amount, including not counting
towards the Threshold Amount) promptly following the mutual agreement of the
parties pursuant to this Section 1.18; provided, that, such recovery by Parent
of the Working Capital Reduction and/or the Net Cash/Net Debt Reduction from
the Escrow Account shall be from the Escrow Stock and the Escrow Cash in the
same proportion that the Escrow Stock and the Escrow Cash respectively bear to
the Escrow Account (with each share of Escrow Stock being deemed to have a
value equal to the Parent Share Price). In the event that the parties'
mutually agreed upon modification of (i) the Net Working Capital results in a
increase of the Net Working Capital (the "Working Capital Increase"), and/or
(ii) the Net Cash/Net Debt resulting in a increase of the Net Cash/Net Debt
(the "Net Cash/Net Debt Increase"), Parent shall, in each case, cause the
Exchange Agent to distribute an amount equal to such Working Capital Increase
and/or Net Cash/Net Debt Increase (in cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
(valued at the Parent Share Price)) in the same proportion as the Escrow Stock
and the Escrow Cash respectively bear to the Escrow Account (with each shares
of Escrow Stock being deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price)
to the Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares
promptly following the mutual agreement of the parties pursuant to this
Section 1.18. If Parent delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance with the
provisions set forth above and Parent and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the determination of the
Settling Audit Firm shall be final and binding on the parties (other than in
the case of manifest error or fraud on the part of the Settling Audit Firm),
and the calculation of the Net Working Capital and/or the Net Cash/Net Debt by
the Settling Audit Firm shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the
parties to this Agreement (other than in the case of manifest error or fraud
on the part of the Settling Audit Firm). In the event that the Settling Audit
Firm's calculation of (i) the Net Working Capital results in a Working Capital
Reduction, and/or (ii) the Net Cash/Net Debt results in a Net Cash/Net Debt
Reduction, as applicable, Parent shall, in each case, be entitled to recover
an amount equal to such Working Capital Reduction and/or Net Cash/Net Debt
Reduction from the Escrow Account (without regard to the Threshold Amount,
including not counting towards the Threshold Amount) promptly following the
Settling Audit Firm's determination pursuant to this Section 1.18; provided,
that, such recovery by Parent of the Working Capital Reduction and/or the Net
Cash/Net Debt Reduction from the Escrow Account shall be from the Escrow Stock
and the Escrow Cash in the same proportion that the Escrow Stock and the
Escrow Cash respectively bear to the Escrow Account (with each share of Escrow
Stock being deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price). In the
event that the Settling Audit Firm's calculation of (i) the Net Working
Capital results in a Working Capital Increase, and/or (ii) the Net Cash/Net
Debt results in a Net Cash/Net Debt Increase, as applicable, Parent shall, in
each case, cause the Exchange Agent to distribute an amount equal to such
Working Capital Increase and/or Net Cash/Net Debt Increase (in cash and shares
of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Share Price) in the same
proportion as the Escrow Stock and the Escrow Cash respectively bear to the
Escrow Account (with each shares of Escrow Stock being deemed to have a value
equal to the Parent Share Price) to the Stockholders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares promptly following the Settling Audit Firm's
determination pursuant to this Section 1.18.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(e) For clarity, (1) any Working Capital Reduction will be applied against any
Net Cash/Net Debt Increase (and vice versa) and (2) any Net Cash/Net Debt
Reduction will be applied against any Working Capital Increase (and vice
versa), such that in each case any payments thereof to Parent or the
Stockholders, as applicable, will be made on a net basis. For clarity, any
adjustments made pursuant to this Section 1.18 to balance sheet line item
components of the Net Working Capital calculation will result in correlative
adjustments to the balance sheet line item components of the Net Cash/Net Debt
calculation (and vice versa) to the extent properly applicable (e.g., if an
accounts receivable amount used in the Net Working Capital calculation is
overstated because the cash subject to such accounts receivable has actually
been collected, Net Working Capital will be reduced by the amount of such
overstatement, but Net Cash/Net Debt will be increased by a corresponding
amount, while if such overstatement is simply incorrect, only Net Working
Capital will be reduced by the amount of such overstatement).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(f) In addition, the Stockholder Representative shall have sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date to notify Parent in writing of any good faith
corrections to the calculation of the Net Working Capital and/or the Net
Cash/Net Debt set forth in the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or
the Closing Date Net Cash/Net Debt Statement (a "Good Faith Correction
Notice"). Such Good Faith Correction Notice shall set forth a reasonably
specific and detailed description of the good faith correction (including
calculations and rationale for the correction) and shall be accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation for such correction. Parent shall provide
the Stockholder Representative with reasonable access during normal business
hours to the financial books and records of the Company for periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

1.19 Tax Consequences. Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or
warranty to the Company or any Stockholder regarding the Tax treatment of the
Merger or the Subsequent Merger, or any of the Tax consequences to the Company
or any Stockholder of this Agreement, the Merger, Sister Sub or the Subsequent
Merger or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The
Company acknowledges that it is relying solely on its own Tax advisors in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and
agreements contemplated hereby, and shall advise the Stockholders to do the
same. In the event that the Subsequent Merger is consummated, Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts not to take any action or fail to take any
action after the Closing Date that will reasonably cause the Integrated
Transaction not to qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

1.20 Further Assurances. The Company agrees that if, at any time after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Parent believes or is advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to
vest, perfect, confirm or continue in the Transitory Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Company, Merger Sub, Sister Sub or Parent title to any property
or any right of the Company as provided herein, Parent and any of its officers
are hereby authorized by the Company to execute and deliver all such proper
deeds, assignments and assurances and to do all other things necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect, confirm or continue title to such property or
rights in the Transitory Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, Merger
Sub, Sister Sub or Parent and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, in the name of the Company or otherwise.

Company Dissenter Rights.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and unless
provided for by applicable Law, each share of Company Capital Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
and that is owned by a Stockholder who has properly perfected such
stockholder's rights of appraisal or dissent within the meaning of Section 262
of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL (each a "Dissenting Share" and together
the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Per Share Preferred Stock
Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect thereto, unless and until
such Stockholder shall have failed to perfect their right of appraisal under
applicable Law, but, instead, the holder thereof shall be entitled to payment
of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of
appraisal, each share of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable, held by such Stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into the right to receive and become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration
or the Per Share Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, with respect thereto,
as applicable, in the manner provided for in Section 1.9.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served or delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under the DGCL or CGCL
consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment
with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any such demand
or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights or dissenters' rights
in accordance with the DGCL or CGCL.

  

  

(c) The Company shall send to any stockholder of the Company who did not
consent to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, the notices
contemplated in Section 1301 of the CGCL and Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the "Dissenters' Notice"), which Dissenters' Notice may be made
a part of the Information Statement. Parent shall furnish such information to
the Company as the Company may reasonably request.

  

  

ARTICLE 2 
 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Sub that,
except as set forth in the letter addressed to Parent, Merger Sub and Sister
Sub from the Company and dated as of the date hereof, including all Schedules
thereto (which will specifically reference the Sections of this Agreement to
which the specific items of disclosure therein constitute an exception, unless
the relevance to other Sections of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from
the wording of the disclosed exceptions, in which case the disclosed
exceptions shall also constitute exceptions to such other Sections of this
Agreement) which has been delivered by the Company to Parent, Merger Sub and
Sister Sub concurrently with the parties' execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter"), each of the representations, warranties and
statements contained in the following Sections of this Article 2 is true and
correct as of the date hereof.

2.1 Organization of the Company.

  

  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the full
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction listed on Schedule 2.1(a)(i) and in each jurisdiction in
which the conduct of its business or the ownership, leasing, holding or use of
its properties makes such qualification necessary, except for such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company By-Laws, each as amended
to date and in full force and effect on the date hereof. The Company is not in
violation of the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws.
Schedule 2.1(a)(ii) lists every state or foreign jurisdiction in which the
Company has facilities, maintains an office, owns any material tangible assets
or has an Employee. Schedule 2.1(a)(iii) sets forth the true and correct
organizational identification number and tax identification number of the
Company. Schedule 2.1(a)(iv) sets forth any trade names or other names under
which the Company is or has done business in the last five (5) years. Schedule
2.1(a)(v) sets forth the true and correct list of all jurisdictions in which
the Company is and has been organized in the last 5 years with corresponding
dates. The Company has not acquired the stock or equity interests or
substantially all the assets of any other Person pursuant to any acquisition
or merger. The phrases "has delivered," "has made available," "has provided"
and any similar phrases, as they relate to information or documents delivered,
made available or provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement, shall be understood to mean that such information or documents have
been either physically delivered by the Company to Parent or posted by the
Company to Fenwick and West's electronic data room for review by Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Company does not own and has never otherwise owned, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of or any other equity interest in, or
controlled, directly or indirectly, any other Person, and the Company is not
and has not otherwise been, directly or indirectly, a party to, member of or
participant in any partnership, joint venture or similar business entity.

  

  

2.2 Authority.

  

  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and any other agreements, certificates or documents
contemplated thereby or hereby (collectively, the "Related Agreements") to
which it is or will be a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that the
Merger is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the
Stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, and (iii)
recommended that the Stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement, the
Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
approve the Merger. The Company has delivered to Parent certified copies of
the resolutions adopted by the Company Board approving this Agreement, the
Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
approving the Merger (the "Board Approval") and such approval has not been
materially altered, rescinded or revoked. No other action by the Company Board
is needed or necessary to duly and validly approve and authorize, on behalf of
the Company, this Agreement, the Merger and all Related Agreements. The
approval of the Merger by the holders of (a) a majority of the issued and
outstanding Company Capital Stock (voting on an as-converted basis), (b) a
majority of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock (voting together
as a single class), and (c) sixty percent (60%) of the Series A Preferred
Stock (collectively, the "Required Company Vote") are the only votes of the
holders of any of the equity interests of the Company necessary to approve the
Merger and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Stockholder Approval"), which approval will be provided
through delivery to the Company of the Stockholder Consents dated as of the
date of this Agreement. The Board Approval and the Stockholder Approval
constitute all necessary corporate and Stockholder action on the part of the
Company Board and the Stockholders for the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Related Agreements by the Company and the
performance by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution of the Stockholder Consents is
sufficient for the Stockholder Approval.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) This Agreement has been, and each of the Related Agreements to which the
Company is a party will be at the Closing, duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties hereto and thereto (other than the Company), this Agreement
constitutes, and in the case of the Related Agreements, they will at Closing
constitute, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by rules and general principles of law and
equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies; provided, however, that the First Certificate of Merger will not be
effective until filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

  

  

2.3 No Conflict. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
and the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (i) do not
and will not conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Certificate
of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws or any resolution adopted by the
Company Board (or any committee thereof), (ii) do not and will not result in
the creation of any Lien upon shares of Company Common Stock or any of the
properties or assets (tangible or intangible) of the Company pursuant to any
Contract to which the Company is a party, (iii) do not and will not conflict
with or result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under,
or trigger any contingent obligations under any Material Contract or Company
Authorization, (iv) do not and will not violate any Law applicable to the
Company or any of its properties or assets (whether tangible or intangible),
and (v) do not and will not give rise to, or trigger the application of, (A)
any rights of any third party under any Material Contract or Company
Authorization or (B) any rights of any third party that would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the Company, in the case of each of
clauses (A) and (B) that would come into effect upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Schedule 2.3(vi) sets forth all
notices to, and all necessary consents, waivers, assignments, releases,
authorizations and approvals of, parties to any Company Contract as are
required thereunder in connection with the Merger, or for any such Company
Contract to remain in full force and effect without limitation, modification
or alteration (including payment of any additional amounts or consideration
other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which the Company would
otherwise be required to pay pursuant to the terms of such Company Contract
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred) after the
Effective Time of the Merger, so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits
to, the Company under such Company Contract from and after the Effective Time
of the Merger, other than such notices, consents, waivers, assignments,
releases, authorizations or approvals that if not obtained by the Company
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be
materially adverse to the Company (provided the foregoing exception does not
extend to Company Contracts that are Material Contracts). No "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation (each, a "Takeover Statute") or any anti-takeover
provision in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws
is applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Agreements.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

2.4 Consents. Other than as set forth on Schedule 2.3(vi) as provided above,
no consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to any court, administrative agency or
commission or other federal, state, county, local or foreign governmental
authority, instrumentality, agency or commission (each, a "Governmental
Entity") or any third party, is required by, or with respect to, the Company
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements to which the Company is a party or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for (i) the filing of the
First Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, (ii) the applicable requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and (iii) such
other filings, authorizations, consents and approvals of third parties that
are not Governmental Entities that if not obtained or made would not
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company.

  

  

2.5 Governmental Authorization. Schedule 2.5 lists each consent, license,
permit, grant or other authorization issued to the Company or to any current
or former employee on behalf of the Company or for the express benefit of the
Company by a Governmental Entity (i) pursuant to which the Company currently
operates or holds any interest in any of its properties or (ii) which is
required for the operation of its business as currently conducted or as
currently proposed to be conducted prior to the Closing or for the holding of
any such interest (collectively, the "Company Authorizations"). The Company
Authorizations are in full force and effect and constitute all Company
Authorizations required to permit the Company to operate or conduct its
business as currently conducted. Neither the Company nor, to the Company's
knowledge, any such Employee is in violation of any material term of any
Company Authorization.

2.6 Capital Structure.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of 52,000,000
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, 40,000,000 of which are
designated as Series 1 Common Stock and 12,000,000 of which are designated as
Series 2 Common Stock, and 12,750,600 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par
value $0.0001 per share. As of the date hereof, there are 44,613 shares of
Series 1 Common Stock issued and outstanding, 9,953,679 shares of Series 2
Common Stock issued and outstanding, 12,750,504 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding. As of the date hereof, the outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into 12,750,504 shares of Series 1
Common Stock. The Company has reserved a sufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock for issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock. The Company has reserved an aggregate of 40,000,000 shares of Series 1
Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Company's 2008 Equity Incentive
Plan, under which as of the date of this Agreement, Company Options are
outstanding for an aggregate of 4,186,058 shares of Series 1 Common Stock,
Company RSUs are outstanding for an aggregate of 196,896 shares of Series 1
Common Stock, and 1,267,559 shares of Series 1 Common Stock are available for
future grant. The Company has delivered to Parent true and complete and
current copies of the Company's form(s) of stock option agreement evidencing
Company Options, form(s) of RSU agreement evidencing Company RSUs and the
Company's 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company has no shares of Company
Capital Stock subject to outstanding Company Equity Rights issued outside of
the Company's 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. As of the date hereof, there are
outstanding Company Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 289,496 shares of
Series 1 Common Stock. The Company has reserved a sufficient number of shares
of Series 1 Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of Company Warrants
outstanding on the date hereof. All shares of Series 1 Company Stock subject
to issuance upon the exercise of Company Options and Company Warrants and
settlement of Company RSUs outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, upon
issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to
which they are issuable, would be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no other issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company and
no outstanding Company Equity Rights. Schedule 2.6(a) accurately sets forth,
as of the date of this Agreement, the name of each Person that is the
registered owner of any shares of Company Capital Stock or any Company Equity
Rights and the number of such shares so owned by such Person or shares that
may be acquired upon exercise or settlement of any Company Equity Rights. The
number of such shares set forth as being so owned by such Person constitutes
the entire interest of such Person in the issued and outstanding capital stock
or voting securities of the Company. All issued and outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock: (i) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and are free of any Lien, preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal or "put" or "call" rights created by statute, the Company Certificate
of Incorporation, the Company By-Laws or any Contract to which the Company is
a party or by which the Company is bound, and (ii) have been offered, sold and

Company Option. All grants of Company Options and Company RSUs were validly
issued and properly approved by the Board in accordance with all applicable
Laws and, with respect to Company Options, no such grants involved any
"backdating" or other option grant timing or similar practices with respect to
the effective date of grant. Any required approval by the Stockholders by the
necessary number of votes or written consent and each such grant was made in

which the Company is a party, by which the Company is bound, or of which the
Company has knowledge relating to the registration, sale or transfer
(including agreements relating to rights of first refusal, "co-sale" rights or
"drag-along" rights) of any Company Common Stock.

of any Company Capital Stock between or among the Company and any of the

Sheet") of the Company as of January 31, 2011 (the "Balance Sheet Date") and
the related unaudited statements of operations and cash flows of the Company
for the one month ended January 31, 2011 (the financial statements referred to
in items (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Company Financial Statements"). The
Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods and at the dates involved and fairly
present, in all material respects, the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and during the
periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited interim period
financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which
individually or in the aggregate would be material in amount, and the omission
of notes thereto).

  

  

(b) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances given the size and stage
of development of the Company (i) that material transactions and expenditures
of the Company (other than customer purchases) are being executed and made
only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the
Company Board, and (ii) that the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data is not materially adversely affected
(collectively, the "Controls"). Neither the Company nor to the Company's
knowledge, any current or former employee or director of the Company, has
identified any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Company's
management or other current or former employees or directors of the Company
who have a role in the preparation of financial statements or the Controls
utilized by the Company, or any written claim or allegation regarding any of
the foregoing. Neither the Company nor, to the Company's knowledge, any
director, officer, employee, auditor or accountant of the Company has received
any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding
deficient accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or its Controls or any material inaccuracy in the
Company's financial statements. No attorney representing the Company, whether
or not employed by the Company, has reported to the Company Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors or employees. There
has been no change in the Company's accounting policies since the Company's
inception, except as described in the Company Financial Statements.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(c) To the Company's knowledge, no Employee has provided information to any
Governmental Entity regarding the commission of any crime by the Company or
the violation by the Company of any Law or Order applicable to the Company.

  

  

(d) The Current Net Working Capital Statement was prepared by the Company in
good faith based on reasonable assumptions and fairly presents the Company's
Net Working Capital as of January 31, 2011 (as determined in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis). The Current Net Working Capital Statement
also presents the Company's estimated Net Working Capital as of March 31,
2011, and such estimate was prepared in good faith based on reasonable
assumptions.

business of the Company or Parent as currently engaged in or conducted by the
Company or Parent, (ii) cause or require Parent to grant to any third party

of Parent (other than the Transitory Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company), (B) any judgment, injunction, order or decree to which the foregoing
Persons are a party, subject to or bound by, or (C) the business practices or

2.12 Real Property; Leases.

  

  

(a) None of the real property used or occupied by the Company, in each case,
together with all buildout, fixtures and improvements created thereon
("Company Real Property"), is owned by the Company, nor has the Company ever
owned any real property. All of the Company Real Property is leased or
subleased by the Company, or the Company has an interest in such Company Real
Property pursuant to a warehousing, license or occupancy agreement.

  

  

(b) Schedule 2.12(b) sets forth all leases, subleases and other agreements
pursuant to which the Company derive their rights in the Company Real Property
(the "Leases"), including, with respect to each such Lease, the identity of

amendment thereto, and the aggregate annual rent.

  

  

(c) The Leases are (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
thereof by the other parties thereto) valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, and there does not exist under any
such Lease any material default by the Company or, to the Company's knowledge,
by any other Person, or any event that, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a material default by the Company or, to the
Company's knowledge, by any other Person. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Agreements will not, in
connection with such Leases, (i) impose any penalty or additional fee upon the
Company, the Transitory Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company, as
successor in interest to the Company, (ii) cause the provisions of any Lease
to be altered, or (iii) cause a breach or default with respect to any Lease.
The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
Leases, including all amendments and agreements related thereto, and the
Leases constitute the entire agreement between the Company and each landlord
or sublandlord with respect to the Company Real Property. All rent and other
charges currently due and payable under the Leases have been paid, subject to
any good faith disputes over such charges.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Company is the holder of the tenant's interest under the Leases and
has not assigned the Leases or subleased all or any portion of the premises
leased thereunder. The Company has not made any alterations, additions or
Improvements to the premises leased under the Leases that are required to be
removed (or of which any landlord or sublandlord could require removal) at the
termination of the applicable Lease term. The Company owns or leases from
third parties all trade fixtures, equipment and personal property located in
the premises leased under the Leases and the landlords thereunder have no Lien
thereon or claim thereto.

  

  

(e) All Improvements on the Company Real Property owned by, leased to, or used
by the Company (i) to the knowledge of the Company substantially conform to

and health and safety ordinances, and to the knowledge of the Company, such
Company Real Property is zoned for the various purposes for which the Company
Real Property and Improvements thereon are presently being used, (ii) are in
good repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and are suitable for the use
presently being made of such Improvements by the Company and (iii) are
adequate and sufficient for the operation of the business of the Company.

  

  

2.13 Assets; Absence of Liens.

  

  

(a) The Company has good and valid title to, or, in the case of Company Real
Property and leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all
of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held
for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except as reflected in
the Company Financial Statements.

  

  

(b) All facilities, machinery, equipment, fixtures, vehicles, and other
tangible personal properties owned, leased or used by the Company (i) are

tear, and reasonably fit and usable for the purposes for which they are being
used, and (iii) comply in all respects with, and are being operated and
otherwise used in material compliance with, all applicable Law.

  

  

2.14 Intellectual Property.

  

  

(a) General. Schedule 2.14(a)(i) sets forth a true and complete list of all
Registered Intellectual Property Rights, specifying, as applicable: the
jurisdictions by or in which such intellectual property has been issued or
registered or in which an application for such issuance or registration has
been filed (or, in the case of Domain Names, the registrars with which such
Domain Names are registered), including the respective registration or
application numbers and dates of issuance, registration or filing, as
applicable. Schedule 2.14(a)(ii) sets forth a true and complete list of all
Company Contracts pursuant to which the Company is authorized to use
Intellectual Property of another Person (excluding Standard Inbound Licenses
and Standard NDAs). Schedule 2.14(a)(iii) sets forth a true and complete list
of all Company Contracts pursuant to which Company has authorized any Person
to use any Company Intellectual Property (other than pursuant to the Company's
applicable standard terms and conditions of sale, license or lease, which
standard terms and conditions have been made available to Parent). Each
Registered Intellectual Property Right: (x) is, to the Company's knowledge,
valid, subsisting and in full force and effect (or in the case of
applications, applied for); (y) has not been abandoned or passed into the
public domain, other than through the expiration of Registered Intellectual
Property Rights at the end of their terms as intentionally permitted by the
Company and as indicated on Schedule 2.14(a)(i); and (z) is free and clear of
all Liens.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Sufficiency of Company Intellectual Property. The Company Intellectual
Property constitutes all of the Intellectual Property used in and/or necessary
to the conduct of the Company's business as it is currently conducted and as
it is currently planned to be conducted by the Company prior to the Closing,
including the design, development, manufacture, use, import and sale of any of
the Company Products, provided that with respect to Patents, the foregoing
representation is made only to the Company's knowledge.

  

  

(c) Title to Company Intellectual Property. Each item of Intellectual Property
used in and/or necessary to the conduct of the Company's business as it is
currently conducted and as it is currently planned to be conducted by the
Company prior to the Closing either: (i) is exclusively owned by the Company
and was written and created solely by employees of the Company acting within
the scope of their employment or by third parties, all of which employees and
third parties have validly and irrevocably assigned (and/or waived in the case
of moral rights) all of their rights, including any Intellectual Property
therein, to the Company except as set forth on Schedule 2.14(c)(i), and no
such third party owns or has any rights to any such Intellectual Property
(other than reversionary interests under the U.S. Copyright Act); or (ii) is
duly and validly licensed to the Company for use in the manner currently used
by the Company and as currently planned to be used by the Company prior to the
Closing, provided that with respect to Patents, the representation in this
clause (ii) is made only to the Company's knowledge. In each case in which the
Company has acquired ownership of any Intellectual Property from any Person,
the Company has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to
irrevocably transfer all rights in such Intellectual Property to the Company
(other than reversionary interests under the U.S. Copyright Act). No Person
who has licensed Intellectual Property to the Company has ownership rights or
license rights to improvements or derivative works made by the Company in such
Intellectual Property. The Company has not transferred to any Person ownership
of, or granted any exclusive license of or right to use, or authorized the
retention of any exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of, any
Intellectual Property that is or was Company Intellectual Property to any
Person (other than the expiration of Registered Intellectual Property Rights
at the end of their terms as intentionally permitted by the Company and as
indicated on Schedule 2.14(a)). None of the Company Intellectual Property
owned by the Company is jointly owned by any other Person.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Validity; Enforceability. To the Company's knowledge, there are no facts
or circumstances that would: (i) render any Company Intellectual Property that
is owned by the Company invalid or unenforceable; (ii) adversely affect any

prior to the date of this Agreement have been accrued on the Company Balance

(f) Each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and
each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code is, to the
knowledge of the Company, so qualified and (1) the Company has received a

(h) With respect to each Company Plan or other arrangement to which the
Company is a party, each such Company Plan and other arrangement has (i) been
maintained and operated since January 1, 2005, in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder so as to avoid the imposition of any Tax, penalty or interest under
Section 409A of the Code and, as to any such Company Plan or such other
arrangement in existence prior to January 1, 2005, has not been "materially
modified" (within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at any time after October
3, 2004, or has been amended in a manner that conforms with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code, and (ii) since January 1, 2009, been operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance
promulgated thereunder both operationally and documentarily. No additional Tax
under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to
be incurred by any "service provider" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-1(f)) under any such Company Plan or such other
arrangement. The Company is not a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any
Company Plan, contract, agreement, or arrangement that provides for the gross-

to the Company's knowledge, threatened (other than routine claims for
benefits) against any such Company Plan or fiduciary thereto or against the
assets of any such Company Plan; (iii) there are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened by any
governmental authority with respect to any Company Plan; and (iv) to the
knowledge of the Company, there has been no breach of fiduciary duty
(including violations under Part 4 of Title I of ERISA) which has resulted or
would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company,
its ERISA Affiliates, or any of their respective employees.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Benefits under each Company Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit
plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, with the exception of any
medical expense reimbursement arrangements subject to Sections 105 and 125 of
the Code) are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies
issued by an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or similar
organization unrelated to the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates, the
premiums for which are paid directly by the Company or its ERISA Affiliates
from its general assets or partly from its general assets and partly from
contributions by its employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to
any such Company Plan requires or permits retroactive increase in premiums or
payments due thereunder.

  

  

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not conflict with or result in any violation of or default under (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
loss of any benefit under any Company Plan, trust or loan that will or may
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee, or any other
material liability for the Company.

  

  

(k) Each Company Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Effective Time of the Merger in accordance with its terms, without
liability to Company or any ERISA Affiliates (except for benefits protected
under Section 411(d) of the Code or Section 204(g) of ERISA and other than
ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event).
None of the Company Plans will be subject to any surrender fees, deferred
sales charges, commissions, or other fees upon termination other than the
normal and reasonable administrative fees associated with their amendment,
transfer or termination.

  

  

(l) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains or
contributes to, or is obligated to contribute to, any material employment,
severance or similar Contract or any material plan, policy, fund, program or
Contract, including multiemployer plan, retirement savings, superannuation,
pension, severance, employment, change-in-control, fringe benefit, bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation and any other employee benefit plan,
agreement, program, policy or other arrangement that is maintained outside the
United States primarily for the benefit of Persons substantially all of whom
are "nonresident aliens" within the meaning of Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA.

Company, or (B) the Company's business or operations; (iv) to the Company's
knowledge, no current Employee, contractor or consultant is in violation of

Employees, consultants or contractors for any wages (including overtime),
salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits or other compensation for any
services performed by them or amounts required to be reimbursed to such
individuals. The Company is not liable for any payment to any trust or other
fund or to any Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for Employees
(other than routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice).

  

  

(i) The Company has not established a severance pay practice or policy. Except
as set forth in Schedule 2.26(i), (i) the Company is not liable for any

other paid time off in accordance with the Company's policies) to any Employee
arising from the termination of employment under any benefit or severance

action or has knowledge of any existing facts or circumstances that could,
either alone or in combination with other events under the control of the

2.29 Bank Accounts. Schedule 2.29 contains a true and complete list of the
name of each bank or other financial institution at which the Company has an

the aggregate exceed ten percent (10%) of the Company's revenues, collected or
accrued, for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31,
2010. None of the customers set forth in Schedule 2.30(a) with respect to the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 has terminated or threatened in writing to
terminate its relationship with the Company. The Company has not received any
written notice from any customer set forth in Schedule 2.30(a) with respect to

largest suppliers on the basis of cost of goods or services purchased for each
of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010. No contract
with any such supplier with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010
obligates the Company to purchase a minimum amount of products or services.
The Company has not received notice from any supplier set forth in Schedule
2.30(b) with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 indicating
that such supplier intends to cease acting as a supplier of Company Products
or otherwise dealing with the Company. The Company does not have any

disclosed, made available to the public or otherwise released for distribution
any of its customer files and other customer information relating to the

is currently conducted. Except for information as provided to sales
representatives (which information is subject to a customary non-disclosure
agreement), no Person other than the Company possesses or has any claims or
rights with respect to use of the Company Customer Information.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

2.32 No Other Agreement to Sell Assets or Company Common Stock. Except as set
forth in this Agreement and the Related Agreements, none of the Company, any
Representative of the Company on behalf of the Company or, to the Company's
knowledge, any Stockholder has any Contract with any Person, (a) to sell,
assign, exclusively license, transfer or effect a sale of any portion of the
assets of the Company (other than inventory and products in the ordinary
course of business), (b) to assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise
dispose of, sell or effect a sale of any Company Common Stock (other than

other reorganization of the Company, or (d) to enter into any Contract or
cause the entering into of a Contract with respect to the foregoing.

  

  

2.33 Representations Complete. None of the representations or warranties made
by the Company in this Agreement, nor any statement made in the Company
Disclosure Letter or any certificate furnished by the Company pursuant to this
Agreement, when taken together, contains any untrue statement of a material
fact, or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances

the FTC for information, documents, or other materials in connection with the
review of the Merger, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such request. The Company and
Parent shall each cooperate reasonably with the other in connection with
resolving any inquiry or investigation by the DOJ or the FTC relating to the
Merger. The Company and Parent shall each promptly inform the other of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding, agreement, or undertaking
with the DOJ or the FTC relating to the Merger. The Company and Parent shall
each give the other reasonable advance notice of, and the reasonable
opportunity to participate in (directly or through its representatives) any
inquiry or investigation by, or any material meeting or conference (whether by
telecommunications or in person) with, the DOJ or the FTC relating to the
Merger, consistent with applicable Laws.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall require or be construed to require Parent, in order to
obtain the consent or successful termination of any review of any Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger, to sell or hold separate, or agree to sell or
hold separate, before or after the Effective Time of the Merger, any assets,
businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, of Parent or any of
its Affiliates, the Transitory Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company
(or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by Parent or by the
Transitory Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company of any assets or
businesses, or any interests in any assets or businesses), or any change in or
restriction on the operation by Parent of any assets or businesses (including
any assets or businesses of the Transitory Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Company), if doing so would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Parent's ability to receive the anticipated
benefits of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger.

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent is required, in order to obtain the consent or
successful termination of any review regarding the Merger, to take any of the
actions set forth in Section 4.7(c), Parent shall have the right to abandon
its efforts to obtain approval of the Merger, notwithstanding this Section
4.7. If Parent so elects to abandon its efforts to seek such approval, it
shall promptly give notice of such abandonment to the Company.

  

  

4.8 Conditions to the Merger; Further Assurances. Each of the parties to this
Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill and cause to be fulfilled the
conditions to closing under this Agreement that are under the reasonable
control of such party. Subject to Section 4.7, each of the parties to this
Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly
with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to
the Merger and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to any
other party hereto in connection with any such requirements imposed upon such
other party in connection with the Merger. Subject to Section 4.7, each party
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and make (and will
cooperate with the other parties in obtaining or making) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any registration, declaration, or
filing with, or an exemption by, any Governmental Entity, or other third
party, required to be obtained or made by such party or its subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or
by this Agreement. Each party hereto, at the request of another party hereto,
shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other
acts and things as may be reasonably necessary for effecting completely the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Related Agreements.

4.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company,
of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which is likely to cause
any representation or warranty of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent,
Merger Sub or Sister Sub, on the other hand, contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect (such that the condition
contained in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.1(a), as the case may be, would not
be satisfied), (ii) any failure of the Company, or Parent, Merger Sub or
Sister Sub, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder
(such that the condition contained in Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.1(b), as the
case may be, would not be satisfied) and (iii) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance of which it has knowledge that could reasonably be expected to
make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Article 5
incapable of satisfaction prior to the Termination Date; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall not limit
or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

4.10 Termination of Certain Agreements. Except for those Company Equity Rights
that are specifically being assumed by Parent pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary to terminate, as of the Closing, any Company Equity Rights granted
by the Company to any Persons and in effect prior to the Closing.

  

  

4.11 No Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time of the Merger and the date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, the Company will not,
will not permit its officers, directors, financial advisors, legal advisors
and the Specified Employees, and will not authorize any of its Employees,
Affiliates, agents or other representatives (collectively, the
"Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, take any of the following
actions with any Person other than Parent and its designees: (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage, entertain or agree to any
proposals or offers from, or execute or deliver any Contracts with, any Person
relating to (A) any merger, membership interest issuance or exchange, business
combination, reorganization, consolidation or similar transaction involving
the Company, (B) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of any equity
interest in the Company, whether by issuance by the Company or by purchase
(through a tender offer, exchange offer, negotiated purchase or otherwise)
from the Stockholders or otherwise, (C) the license (other than non-exclusive
licenses in the ordinary course of business) or transfer (other than sales of
Company Products in the ordinary course of business) of a material portion of
the assets of the Company, or (D) any transaction that would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Merger or on the Company's
ability to consummate the Merger (any of the transactions described in clauses
(A) through (D), a "Third-Party Acquisition"); or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, respond to any inquiry made, or furnish
to any Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, agree to, assist or participate in, solicit, consider, entertain,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage, any effort or attempt by any
Person to do, seek or enter, a Third-Party Acquisition.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If the Company or any Representative receives an unsolicited inquiry or
offer, or is approached in any manner by a Person, relating to a Third-Party
Acquisition, the Company will (i) promptly notify Parent of the same and the
details thereof (including the identity of the Person making the same), (ii)
provide to Parent a copy of any written inquiry or offer and all
correspondence related thereto, and (iii) keep Parent informed of the status
thereof.

  

  

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 4.11 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 4.11 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which Parent may be entitled at Law or in equity. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
above by any officer, director, legal advisor, financial advisor, Stockholder
or Specified Employee shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.11 by
the Company.

  

  

4.12 Certain Employment Matters.

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

Offers of Employment.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(i) Specified Employees. As of the date of this Agreement, the Founders shall
have entered into the Specified Employee Offer Package Agreements. Prior to
the Closing Date, the non-Founder Specified Employee shall enter into an offer
package agreement on terms mutually agreed upon by such non-Founder Specified
Employee and Parent.

  

  

(ii) Continuing Employees. Other than the Specified Employees who are
addressed separately in Section 4.12(a)(i) above, Parent presently intends
(but is not obligated), prior to the Closing Date, to extend offers of
employment, in Parent's sole discretion, to Employees employed by the Company
as of the date of this Agreement, or who may become employed by the Company
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section 4.2(e)(i)(B), in
each case, on terms and conditions that Parent determines in its sole
discretion. Each Employee (excluding the Specified Employees) who accepts
employment with Parent and transfers to employment with Parent is hereafter
referred to as a "Continuing Employee." The Continuing Employees will be
employed by Parent on an at-will basis (terminable with or without cause and
with or without notice) and otherwise on terms of employment determined by
Parent (but subject to Parent's policies and procedures for employees of
comparable status).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Continuing Employee Agreements. Each Continuing Employee shall be
required, as a condition to employment with Parent, to execute and deliver to
Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, (i) Parent's form of Proprietary
Information Agreement, and (ii) such other documents as Parent requires
generally of its employees of comparable status ((i) and (ii) together, the
"Continuing Employee Agreements"), which Continuing Employee Agreements will
be furnished to such employees no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date and will only become effective upon the Closing.

  

  

(c) General Compensation and Benefits. Continuing Employees shall receive
standard employee benefits offered by Parent to its employees of comparable
status (it being understood that Parent shall offer the Continuing Employees
(i) an amount of base salary and target bonus that is at least equivalent, in
the aggregate, to that provided by the Company, and (ii) eligibility to
participate in Parent's bonus plans in an amount and on terms equivalent to
similarly situated employees of Parent and, with respect to determination of
vacation accrual and vesting in 401(k) plan related benefits, comparable
length of service (in determining length of service, Parent shall include each
Continuing Employee's length of service with the Company)). Coverage for each
Continuing Employee under Parent's benefit plans and programs shall commence
as of 12:01 A.M. on the day such Continuing Employee commences employment with
Parent. Subject to the consent of any third-party insurer, no exclusion of
conditions pre-existing as of the commencement of the Continuing Employee's
employment with Parent shall be imposed under Parent's welfare benefit plans
and programs except to the extent applicable as of that date under the
comparable plan or program of the Company.

  

  

(d) No Right to Continued Employment or Benefits. Neither Parent, Merger Sub
nor Sister Sub is under any obligation to hire or retain any Employee, or
provide any Employee with any particular benefits (other than as may be
expressly provided in the Specified Employee Offer Package Agreements or the
Continuing Employee Agreements), or make any payments or provide any benefits
to those Employees whom Parent subsequently terminates.

  

  

(e) FICA, Employment Taxes. With respect to any Employees terminated by the
Company prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall be
responsible for all FICA, payroll and employment Taxes relating to each
Employee until the termination of his or her employment with the Company,
including any payments made with respect to any Company Equity Rights. Parent
shall be responsible for all FICA, payroll and employment taxes relating to
the Continuing Employees and the Specified Employees commencing from the date
on which their employment with Parent commences.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Company Employee Plans. Effective immediately preceding the Closing, the
Company will take action to terminate any and all Company Plans intended to
qualify as qualified cash or deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the
Code and, at the request of Parent, the Company will provide Parent with
reasonable evidence, in the form of resolutions of the Company's Board
terminating such Company Plan, that such plans have been terminated not later
than, and effective immediately prior to, the Closing pursuant to resolutions
duly adopted by the Company Board or other duly-designated authority. In
addition, the Company will take action prior to the Closing to amend such
Company Plan effective prior to its termination to provide for the automatic
payment of participants' accounts upon plan termination in the form of a lump
sum, rather than an annuity. In the event that termination of such Company
Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender
charges or other fees (other than the normal and reasonable administrative
fees associated with termination), then the Company will take such actions as
are reasonably necessary to estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

4.13 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Post-Closing Tax Returns. Parent shall properly and accurately prepare (or
cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) each Tax Return required
to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date for a taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date. Such Tax Return shall be provided to the
Stockholder Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing such return (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) days of the
Closing, as soon as possible following the Closing); and the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to review, comment on and consent to
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) such Tax Return.
Parent shall consider in good faith such revisions to such Tax Returns as the
Stockholder Representative reasonably requests. The failure of the Stockholder
Representative to propose any changes to any such Tax Return within fifteen
(15) days of receipt thereof shall constitute consent.

  

  

(b) Straddle Period Allocations. For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes of the
Company incurred with respect to a taxable period that includes but does not
end on the Closing Date, shall be allocated to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date (i) except as provided in (ii) and (iii)
below, to the extent feasible, on a specific identification basis, according
to the date of the event or transaction giving rise to the Tax, and (ii)
except as provided in (iii) below, with respect to periodically assessed ad
valorem Taxes and Taxes not otherwise feasibly allocable to specific
transactions or events, in proportion to the number of days in such taxable
period occurring through the Closing Date compared to the total number of days
in such taxable period, and (iii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income or receipts, in an amount equal to the Tax which would be payable if
the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Amended Returns; Tax Election. Except consistently with a resolved audit,
neither the Stockholders nor the Company may amend a Tax Return of the
Company, or file or amend any Tax election relating to the Company, in each
case, with respect to a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with the exchange of
Company Capital Stock for Adjusted Net Base Amount as contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the Stockholders when due. The Stockholders shall,
at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes and fees; if required by applicable Law, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.

  

  

(e) Tax Certificates. The parties agree, upon request, to use reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could otherwise be imposed.

  

  

(f) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing, Tax allocation,
Tax indemnity or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  

  

(g) Tax Proceedings. Any party who receives any notice of a pending or
threatened Tax audit, assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to the
Company which may give rise to liability of another party hereto, shall
promptly notify such other party within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt
of such notice. The parties each agree to consult with and to keep each other
informed on a regular basis regarding the status of any Tax audit or
proceeding to the extent that such audit or proceeding could affect a
liability of such other parties (including indemnity obligations hereunder).
The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to represent the Company's
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding and to
employ counsel of its choice, but reasonably satisfactory to Parent, at its
expense, but only to the extent such audit or other proceeding pertains to
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and for which the
Stockholders are required to indemnify pursuant to Article 6. Parent shall
have the right to participate in such proceeding at its own expense, and shall
be entitled to control the disposition of any issue involved in such
proceeding which does not affect a potential liability of the Stockholders.
Parent and the Stockholders shall be entitled to represent their own interests
in light of their responsibilities (including indemnity obligations) for
Taxes, at their own expense, in any audit or administrative or judicial
proceedings involving a taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
4.13(g), (1) the Stockholders shall not, without Parent's consent (which will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree to any settlement with respect
to any Tax if such settlement could adversely affect any Tax liability of
Parent or (with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date or for which the Stockholders are otherwise not
required to indemnify pursuant to Article 6) the Company and (2) Parent shall
not, without the Stockholder Representative's consent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree to any settlement with respect to any
Tax if such settlement could adversely affect any Tax liability of the
Stockholders or (with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) prior
to the Closing Date for which the Stockholders are required to indemnify
pursuant to Article 6) the Company. Except as provided in this Section
4.13(g), the provisions of Section 6.4 including the provisions therein
addressing settlement authority, shall govern the manner in which any Tax
audits or administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes are
resolved.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Cooperation, Access to Information, and Record Retention. The Stockholders
and Parent shall cooperate, and cause their representatives and Affiliates to
cooperate, to the extent reasonably requested by any other party hereto in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company. Such
cooperation shall include the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Stockholders, Parent and the Company shall (i) retain all books
and records with respect to Company Taxes (including Tax Returns) relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations for assessment of Taxes for such respective taxable
period, and (ii) give the other parties hereto reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
another party so requests, allow such party to take possession of such books
and records.

  

  

4.14 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company. Parent and
Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
now existing in favor of the employee, agents, directors or officers of the
Company (the "Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-Laws shall be included in the
Surviving Company's Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, except as
otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, and shall, together with any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company and any Company Indemnified
Parties in existence on the date hereof, continue in full force and effect for
any claims relating to any act or omission occurring prior to the Effective
Time for a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, assuming
the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that, in the event any
claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights
to indemnification or exculpation in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of any all such claims; provided further that
Parent will cause the Surviving Company to fulfill and honor the obligations
of the Surviving Company under this Section 4.14. Any determination required
to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Party's conduct
complies with the standards set forth in the Surviving Company's Certificate
of Incorporation and by-laws or otherwise shall be made by independent counsel
selected by the Surviving Company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
Indemnified Party (or in the case of such indemnification agreements
"Independent Counsel" (as such term is defined therein)) ("Independent
Counsel"). Such Independent Counsel's determination shall be final and binding
on Parent, the Surviving Company and the Company Indemnified Party, and the
fees and expenses of such Independent Counsel shall be paid by the Surviving
Company. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, at its sole cost
and expense, a fully prepaid "tail" policy under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, which contains coverage
terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of
the Company (the "Company DandO Tail Policy"). If the Merger is consummated,
then Parent will not cancel the Company DandO Tail Policy during its term and
will reasonably cooperate with any covered persons in making claims for
coverage against the insurer thereunder. Nothing in this Section 4.14 shall be
construed to limit any right that Parent would otherwise have to obtain
indemnification pursuant to Article 6 in connection with any matter underlying
any claim for indemnification by any of the Company Indemnified Parties. The
provisions of this Section 4.14 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

4.15 Litigation. The Company will (a) notify Parent in writing promptly after
learning of any action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim, or
investigation by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by
or against it, or to the Company's knowledge to be threatened against the
Stockholders, the Company or any of its directors, officers or Employees in
their capacity as such (a "New Litigation Claim"), (b) notify Parent of
ongoing material developments in any New Litigation Claim, and (c) consult in
good faith with Parent regarding the conduct of the defense of any New
Litigation Claim.

  

  

4.16 Financial Statements. The Company acknowledges Parent must file with the
SEC on Form 8-K the financial statements required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.
From and after the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time of the Subsequent
Merger, or, in the event of the Company Election, the Effective Time of the
Merger, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford
and make available to Parent and to the independent public accountants
selected by Parent to perform the necessary audits and reviews, reasonable
access during normal business hours to such records, financial statements or
other documentation as may be necessary or useful in the preparation and audit
of the required financial statements. From and after the date of this
Agreement, unless this Agreement is sooner terminated pursuant to its terms,
the Company, and following the Closing, each of the Specified Employees, shall
use his or her commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the preparation
and audit of such financial statements in the manner reasonably requested by
Parent, including making available to Parent and the independent public
accountants following the Closing Date persons familiar with such records,
financial statements or other documentation (who remain employed by Parent or
its subsidiaries) as may be necessary to assist Parent in complying with its
reporting obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the
Company's or the Specified Employees' obligations under this Section 4.16
require them to hire or retain additional employees, consultants, advisors or
auditors or otherwise incur any out-of-pocket expenses (other than incidental
expenses associated with duplication or scanning of relevant records,
financial statements or other documentation). For the avoidance of doubt, the
sole remedy for breach of this Section 4.16 by the Stockholders shall be
specific performance (and the Stockholders acknowledge and agree such remedy
shall be available against them).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

4.17 Invention Assignment Agreement. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Employees involved in the development of

transfer set forth in the Equity Consideration Lock-Up Agreements or the
Founder Lock-Up Agreements, Parent will, promptly following the Closing (upon
receiving the Company's financial statements, and auditor consent, necessary
to permit Parent to file the Resale Registration Statement), prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on the appropriate form (the "Resale
Registration Statement"), providing for the offer and resale of the Parent

receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement or (b) any Founder, has
not executed an Equity Consideration Lock-Up Agreement or Founder Lock-Up
Agreement, as applicable, with Parent, the Company shall use its best efforts
to cause such Equity Consideration Lock-Up Agreement or Founder Lock-Up
Agreement to be executed, as applicable, promptly following the date of this
Agreement.

  

  

4.21 Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule. The Company will, within at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, prepare and deliver to

4.22 Parachute Payments. Before the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company
will (a) submit to all persons entitled to vote (within the meaning of the
Treasury Regulations under Section 280G of the Code) the material facts
concerning all payments and benefits that Parent and the Company reasonably
believe, in the absence of stockholder approval of such payments and benefits,
constitute or could constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (collectively, "Parachute Payments"), in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel, which will
satisfy all requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, and (b) solicit the approval and consent of all such
persons with respect to the Parachute Payments in a manner in conformity with
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

shall take all such commercially reasonable steps as may be required (to the

individual who would reasonably be expected to be subject to the reporting

of this Agreement (in the case of representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter only) and as of the Closing

contrary contained in this Agreement or in any Related Agreement, as an

6.3 Limitations.

  

  

(a) No claims shall be made by any Indemnified Party for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(i), unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses
for which the Indemnified Parties seek to be indemnified pursuant to Section
6.2(a)(i) exceed 0.39% of the Adjusted Net Base Amount (the "Threshold
Amount"), at which time the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek
indemnification for all such Losses (including all Losses included within the
Threshold Amount starting from the first dollar).

  

  

(b) In determining the amount of any Losses in respect of the failure of any
representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular date,
any materiality standard or qualification contained in such representation or
warranty shall be disregarded; provided, however, that such materiality
standard or qualification shall not be disregarded for the purposes of the
initial determination of whether there was a failure of such representation or
warranty to be true and correct as aforesaid.

  

  

(c) If the Merger is consummated, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document,
Parent acknowledges and agrees (on behalf of itself and all of the Indemnified
Parties) that, other than specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy (other than the doctrine of equitable indemnification) in
each case, to the extent expressly made available to Parent or the Indemnified
Parties hereunder, or in the case of fraud (including the element of
scienter), (i) the indemnification provisions in this Article 6 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Indemnified Parties for any and
all claims against the Indemnifying Parties for Losses and any and all other
damages incurred by Parent and the Indemnified Parties with respect to
breaches of any Operative Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby,
(ii) all applicable statutes of limitations or other claims periods with
respect to claims hereunder and thereunder shall be shortened to the survival
periods expressly provided in Section 6.1, and (iii) such parties irrevocably
waive any and all rights they may otherwise have outside of the
indemnification provisions in this Article 6 to make claims against the
Indemnifying Parties under statutory and common law as a result of any Losses
or any and all other damages incurred by Parent and the Indemnified Parties
with respect to breaches of any Operative Documents, whether or not in excess
of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to the
indemnification provisions in this Article 6.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If the Merger is consummated, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document,
recovery from the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement for the matters listed in Section 6.2(a), except in the case of
fraud (including the element of scienter), failure of the Fundamental
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or failure to comply with
covenants as aforesaid. In the case of failure of the Fundamental
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or failure to comply with
covenants aforesaid, after the Indemnified Parties have exhausted or made
claims upon all of the Escrow Amount, each Stockholder shall be liable for his
or her Pro Rata Share of the amount of any Losses resulting therefrom;
provided, however, that the maximum aggregate liability of any Stockholder for
any and all such claims shall be limited to such Stockholder's amount of
Closing Cash, Closing Stock, Escrow Cash and Escrow Stock actually received by
such Stockholder (where each share of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to
have a value equal to the Parent Share Price); providedfurther that in the
event that any Stockholder elects to satisfy the aforementioned Losses through
the return of consideration from the Merger, such Stockholder will return
Closing Cash and Closing Stock in the same proportion that the Escrow Cash and
the Escrow Stock respectively bear to the Escrow Amount (with each share of
Escrow Stock being deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price);
provided, however, that with respect to that portion of any Losses that
exceeds the Escrow Cash and the Escrow Stock then in escrow (with each share
of Escrow Stock being deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price),
each Stockholder reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to satisfy any
such portion of Losses for which it is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified
Party via a payment of cash to such Indemnified Party in lieu of returning
shares of Closing Stock.

  

  

(e) The Indemnified Parties will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate potential claims for Losses and agree that the Indemnifying Parties
will not be liable to indemnify any Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article 6 for any Losses proximately caused by the failure of the Indemnified
Parties to so exercise such efforts.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company, and the rights and
remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations, will not be limited or
affected by any investigation conducted by Parent, Merger Sub or Sister Sub,
or any agent of Parent, Merger Sub or Sister Sub with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent, Merger Sub or
Sister Sub or any agent of Parent, Merger Sub or Sister Sub at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing, with respect to, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any
such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation as aforesaid. The waiver
by Parent, Merger Sub or Sister Sub of any of the conditions set forth in
Article 5 will not affect or limit the provisions of this Article 6.

  

  

(g) (i) No claims shall be made by any Stockholder for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2(b), and Parent shall have no Liability to the
Stockholders for Losses pursuant to Section 6.2(b) unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Losses for which the Stockholders seek to be
indemnified pursuant to Section 6.2(b) exceeds the Threshold Amount, at which
time the Stockholders shall be entitled to seek indemnification for all such
Losses (including all Losses included within the Threshold Amount starting
from the first dollar).

(ii) If the Merger is consummated, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Parent Operative
Document, each Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that, other than specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedy (other than the
doctrine of equitable indemnification) in each case, to the extent expressly
made available to such Stockholder hereunder, or in the case of fraud
(including the element of scienter), (i) the indemnification provisions in
this Article 6 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of such Stockholder for
any and all claims against Parent for Losses and any and all other damages
incurred by such Stockholder with respect to breaches of any Parent Operative
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) all applicable
statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims
hereunder and thereunder shall be shortened to the survival periods expressly
provided in Section 6.1, and (iii) such Stockholder irrevocably waives any and
all rights he or she may otherwise have outside of the indemnification
provisions in this Article 6 to make claims against Parent under statutory and
common law as a result of any Losses or any and all other damages incurred by
such Stockholder with respect to breaches of any Parent Operative Documents,
whether or not in excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered
pursuant to the indemnification provisions in this Article 6.

  

  

(iii) If the Merger is consummated, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Parent Operative
Document, provided that Parent timely pays the Adjusted Net Base Amount to the
Stockholders as required by this Agreement (including the timely release of
the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement), in no event shall Parent be liable to the Stockholders under
Section 6.2(b) for any Losses in excess of an amount, in the aggregate, equal
to the value of the Escrow Stock (where each share of Parent Common Stock
shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Share Price), except in
the case of fraud (including the element of scienter), failure of the
representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub and Sister Sub set forth
in Sections3.1 (Organization of Parent and Merger Sub), 3.2 (Authority), 3.4
(Capitalization), 3.5(a)-(b) (Reports and Financial Information) and 3.6
(Parent Common Stock (first sentence only)) (collectively, the "Parent
Fundamental Representations") to be true and correct as aforesaid, or failure
to comply with covenants as aforesaid; provided, however, in the case of
failure of the Parent Fundamental Representations to be true and correct as
aforesaid or failure to comply with covenants aforesaid, Parent's maximum
aggregate liability to the Stockholders for any Losses suffered in connection
therewith shall in no event exceed the aggregate value of the Closing Stock
and Escrow Stock actually received by the Stockholders pursuant to the Merger
(where each share of Parent Common Stock shall be deemed to have a value equal
to the Parent Share Price).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) The Stockholders will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate potential claims for Losses and agree that Parent will not be liable
to indemnify the Stockholders pursuant to this Article 6 for any Losses
proximately caused by the failure of the Stockholders to so exercise such
efforts.

  

  

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations of Parent, and the rights and remedies
that may be exercised by the Stockholders based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations, will not be limited or affected by any
investigation conducted by the Company, the Stockholders or any agent of the
Company or the Stockholders with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) by the Company or the Stockholders or any agent of
the Company or the Stockholders at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to, the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation as aforesaid. The waiver by the Company of
any of the conditions set forth in Article 5 will not affect or limit the
provisions of this Article 6.

  

  

(h) The provisions of this Article 6 (including any limitations set forth
herein) shall not apply with respect to fraud (including the element of
scienter).

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 6 with
respect to that portion of a particular Liability that has been taken into
account in the calculation of Net Working Capital or Net Cash/Net Debt (as
such calculations are ultimately finalized through the processes set forth in
Section 1.18 and after recovery by Parent of any Working Capital Reduction
and/or Net Cash/Net Debt Reduction pursuant to Section 1.18) and fully
extinguished, offset or monetized in connection therewith; provided, however,
that this Section 6.3(i) shall not operate to reduce, eliminate or diminish
any indemnification otherwise available to an Indemnified Party under this
Article 6 with respect to all or any portion of a Liability that is not so
fully extinguished, offset or monetized.

  

  

6.4 Procedures.

  

  

(a) General. Promptly after the discovery by any Indemnified Party of any Loss
or Losses, claim or breach, including any claim by a third party against any
Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), that gives rise to indemnification
hereunder, Parent (on behalf of the Indemnified Party) shall, in good faith,
deliver to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to the Stockholder Representative) a
certificate, in the form provided as Exhibit A to the Escrow Agreement (a
"Claim Certificate"), that:

  

  

(i) states that the Indemnified Party has paid or accrued (in accordance with
GAAP, without reference to any thresholds or materiality requirements that
GAAP may otherwise require) Losses, or reasonably anticipates in good faith
that it may or will pay or incur liability for Losses, for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement
(it being understood that unless otherwise consented to by the Stockholder
Representative, with respect to any Losses which have been accrued for or
which are reasonably anticipated, but which have not actually been paid or
otherwise settled, while such Losses may be the subject of a Claim
Certificate, such Losses shall not be recoverable until actually paid or
otherwise settled); and

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable, the amount of,
and basis for, such Losses;

  

  

provided, however, that no delay on the part of Parent in notifying the Escrow
Agent and Stockholder Representative shall relieve the Indemnifying Parties of
any liability or obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Parties have been materially prejudiced thereby, and then only to
such extent. If the Stockholder Representative, in good faith, objects to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim Certificate (each a "Contested Loss"), the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver a written notice, in the form provided as Exhibit
B to the Escrow Agreement (the "Contest Notice"), to such effect to the Escrow
Agent, with a duplicate copy delivered simultaneously to Parent, within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of such Claim
Certificate. Thereafter, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Contest Notice with respect to each
Contested Loss. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree with
respect to any of such claims, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement and, if
applicable, an instruction to the Escrow Agent. In the event that any
Indemnified Party seeks to bring an indemnification claim hereunder directly
against the Stockholders to the extent permitted by Section 6.4(d), then
"Stockholder" will be substituted for "Escrow Agent" and "Stockholder
Representative" in the procedures set forth in this Section 6.4 as the context
requires.

  

  

(b) Arbitration of Contested Losses. Any Contested Loss that is not resolved
in accordance with Section 6.4(a) will be submitted to mandatory, final and
binding arbitration before J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE or its successor ("J.A.M.S."),
pursuant to the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C., Section 1 et seq. and
any such arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California. In the
event J.A.M.S. ceases to provide arbitration service, then the term "J.A.M.S."
will thereafter mean and refer to the American Arbitration Association
("AAA"). Either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may commence the
arbitration process called for by this Agreement by filing a written demand
for arbitration with J.A.M.S. and giving a copy of such demand to each of the
other parties to this Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of J.A.M.S' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration (or,
if J.A.M.S. then means the AAA, the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA
then in effect), subject to the provisions of this Section 6.4(b). The parties
will cooperate with J.A.M.S. and with each other in promptly selecting a
single arbitrator from J.A.M.S.' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the
arbitration proceedings in order to fulfill the provisions, purposes and
intent of this Agreement. The parties covenant that they will participate in
the arbitration in good faith, and that they will share in its costs in
accordance with subparagraph (i) below. The provisions of this Section 6.4(b)
may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. Judgment upon the
Final Award (as defined in Section 6.4(b)(iii)) or any other final finding
rendered by the arbitrator in the arbitration may be entered in any court
having competent jurisdiction.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Payment of Costs. The expenses required by the arbitrator (including all
reasonable costs, fees and expenses related to the arbitration, reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, the fees of each arbitrator and the
administrative fee of the arbitration proceedings) shall be paid by either
Parent or the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be, whose amount set
forth in the Claim Certificate or the Contest Notice, as the case may be,
prior to the submission of the matter to the arbitrator was further from
amount determined by the arbitrator; provided, however, that in the event the
Stockholder Representative fails to timely pay the arbitrator's expenses, the
parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such arbitrator's expenses and
recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from the Escrow Account
according to each Stockholder's respective Pro Rata Share interest in the
Escrow Cash and the Escrow Stock, as applicable.

  

  

(ii) Burden of Proof. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein,
for any Contested Loss submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof will be
borne by the party seeking indemnification as it would be if the claim were
litigated in a judicial proceeding governed exclusively by the internal laws
of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and entered into
within the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of choice of
law or conflicts of law of any jurisdiction.

  

  

(iii) Award. Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the
arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a final
written arbitration award setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision
reached (the "Final Award") and will deliver such documents to the Stockholder
Representative and Parent, together with a signed copy of the Final Award. The
Final Award will constitute a conclusive determination of all issues in
question, binding upon the Stockholder Representative and Parent, and will
include an affirmative statement to such effect.

  

  

(iv) Timing. The Stockholder Representative, Parent and the arbitrator will
conclude each arbitration pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) as promptly as
reasonably practicable for the Contested Loss being arbitrated.

  

  

(v) Terms of Arbitration. The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these
provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the
terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

(vi) Treatment of Losses. Upon issuance and delivery of the Final Award as
provided in Section 6.4(b)(iii) above, Parent will immediately be entitled to
recover from the Escrow Account the amount of any Losses determined and
awarded to Parent under such Final Award. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Third-Party Claims. The Indemnified Party shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of any such Third-Party Claim; provided,
however, that the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to receive
copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-
party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any
privilege relating to any Indemnified Party and shall be entitled, at its
expense, to participate in, but not to conduct, any defense of the Third-Party
Claim; provided further, that the Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any such Third-Party
Claim effected without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (it being understood that the Stockholder Representative shall be
deemed to have reasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed such consent if it
believes, in good faith, that there is not an underlying basis for
indemnification under Section 6.2(a)). If any such action or claim is settled
with the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, or if the
Stockholder Representative, in good faith, agrees in writing to the amount of
a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action being indemnifiable
under this Article 6, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification for the amount of such settlement or judgment (and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses, and other reasonable professional, experts' and
consultant's fees and other reasonable costs of defense or investigation
incurred in connection with defending such Third-Party Claim).

  

  

(d) Stockholder Claims. Claims by the Stockholders for indemnification under
this Article 6 shall be made and resolved according to the following:

  

  

(i) General. Promptly after the discovery by any Stockholder of any Loss or
Losses, claim or breach, including any claim by a third party against any
Stockholder (a "Stockholder Third-Party Claim"), that gives rise to
indemnification hereunder, such Stockholder shall, in good faith, deliver to
Parent a certificate (a "Stockholder Claim Certificate"), that

  

  

(A) states that the Stockholder has paid or accrued (for any entity
Stockholder only, in accordance with GAAP, without reference to any thresholds
or materiality requirements that GAAP may otherwise require) Losses, or
reasonably anticipates in good faith that it may or will pay or incur
liability for Losses, for which such Stockholder is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that unless
otherwise consented to by Parent, with respect to any Losses which have been
accrued for or which are reasonably anticipated, but which have not actually
been paid or otherwise settled, while such Losses may be the subject of a
Stockholder Claim Certificate, such Losses shall not be recoverable until
actually paid or otherwise settled); and

  

  

(B) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable, the amount of,
and basis for, such Losses;

  

  

provided, however, that no delay on the part of such Stockholder in notifying
Parent shall relieve Parent of any liability or obligations hereunder, except
to the extent that Parent has been materially prejudiced thereby, and then
only to such extent. If Parent, in good faith, objects to the indemnification
of a Stockholder in respect of any claim or claims specified in any
Stockholder Claim Certificate (each a "Parent Contested Loss"), Parent shall
deliver a written notice (the "Parent Contest Notice"), to such effect to such
Stockholder, within thirty (30) days after receipt by Parent of such
Stockholder Claim Certificate. Thereafter, Parent and such Stockholder shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Parent Contest Notice with respect
to each Parent Contested Loss. If such Stockholder and Parent agree with
respect to any of such claims, such Stockholder and Parent shall promptly
prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Arbitration of Parent Contested Losses. Any Parent Contested Loss that is
not resolved in accordance with Section 6.4(d)(i) shall be resolved according
to the same procedures set forth in Section 6.4(b) mutatis mutandis (e.g.,
substitution of "Parent Contested Loss" for "Contested Loss", "Stockholder"
for "Parent" and "Parent" for "Stockholder Representative," and disregard of
references to Escrow Account, Escrow Cash and Escrow Stock, etc.).

  

  

(iii) Stockholder Third-Party Claims. Any Stockholder Third-Party Claims shall
be resolved according to the same procedures set forth in Section 6.4(c)
mutatis mutandis (e.g., substitution of "Stockholder Third-Party Claim" for
"Third-Party Claim", "Stockholder" for "Indemnified Party", "Parent" for
"Stockholder Representative" and "Indemnifying Parties" etc.).

  

  

6.5 Merger Consideration Adjustment. The Company, Parent and the Stockholders
agree to treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this Article 6 as an
adjustment to the Adjusted Net Base Amount for all Tax purposes, to the extent
it may be properly so treated for Tax purposes, and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a
determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  

  

6.6 Stockholder Representative; Power of Attorney.

  

  

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
by the Stockholders, each Stockholder hereby initially appoints, as of the
date of this Agreement, the individual identified as the Stockholder
Representative on the signature page of this Agreement (together with his/her
permitted successors, the "Stockholder Representative"), as his, her or its
true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact to enter into any Related Agreement
and any transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and with respect to
claims for indemnification by Indemnified Parties affiliated with Parent under
this Article 6 for which recovery from the Escrow Amount is sought only, to:
(i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf
of itself or any other Indemnified Party) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions and other
matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice
or communication shall be given or received by such Stockholders
individually); (ii) authorize deliveries to Parent of cash or shares of Parent
Common Stock from the Escrow Amount in satisfaction of claims asserted by
Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party, including by not
objecting to claims thereto); (iii) object to any claims by Parent or any
other Indemnified Party to the Escrow Amount; (iv) consent or agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards or arbitrators with respect to
such claims; (v) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and agree to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against
any such Indemnifying Party or by any Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (vi) amend this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other Related Agreement or other
agreement referred to herein or contemplated hereby; and (vii) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without
having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance
(except as otherwise agreed to by the Stockholder Representative).

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

88  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The individual identified on the signature page to this Agreement as the
Stockholder Representative hereby accepts his appointment as the Stockholder
Representative.

  

  

(c) The person serving as the Stockholder Representative may be replaced from
time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Amount
upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to Parent and with
Parent's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. No bond
shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder
Representative shall receive no compensation for his services. With respect to
the authorized duties and powers of the Stockholder Representative, notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each of the Stockholders.

  

  

(d) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Indemnifying
Party for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholder Representative
while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice
of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Indemnifying
Parties shall severally (and not jointly) indemnify the Stockholder
Representative and hold him/her harmless against any loss, Liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his/her duties hereunder. The Stockholder
Representative may arrange to receive reimbursement directly from the
Indemnifying Parties for any and all expenses, charges and liabilities,
including attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by the Stockholder
Representative in the performance or discharge of his/her rights and
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that neither Parent, the
Transitory Surviving Corporation nor the Surviving Company shall have any
Liability with respect to such items. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, such expenses, charges and
liabilities may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from Escrow
Cash and Escrow Stock otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying Parties (and
not distributed or distributable to any Indemnified Party or subject to a
pending indemnification claim of any Indemnified Party) following the
expiration of the Escrow Release Date, at the time of distribution, and such
recovery will be made from the Indemnifying Parties according to their
respective Pro Rata Shares.

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

89  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall have access to relevant information
about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Continuing Employees
for purposes of performing his/her duties and exercising his/her rights
hereunder; provided that the Stockholder Representative shall treat
confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the
Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to
treat such information confidentially).

  

  

(f) With respect to the authorized duties and powers of the Stockholder
Representative, any notice or communication given or received by, and any
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholder
Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Indemnifying Party; and each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or
by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every
such Indemnifying Party. Each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent are
hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Article 6 and the
Escrow Agreement.

  

  

6.7 No Subrogation. Following the Closing, no Indemnifying Party shall have
any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company,
the Transitory Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company with respect to
any indemnification made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party under
Section 6.2 if the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

  

  

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at

by the 120th calendar day following the date hereof (the "Termination Date");
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing Date to occur on or before the Termination Date and such action or
failure constitutes a breach of this Agreement; (2) there shall be a final
