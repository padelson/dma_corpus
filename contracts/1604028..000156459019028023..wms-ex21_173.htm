to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, if any, which shall be
addressed in accordance with Section 2.09) shall be converted into the right
to receive in cash the Per Share Portion of (x) the Estimated Closing Cash
Proceeds in accordance with Section 2.03 (collectively, the "Class A
Stockholders\' Closing Consideration"), and (y) any Adjustments, in each case,
after taking into consideration the rights of the Participants to any portion
of such consideration pursuant to the Incentive Bonus Plan.

to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive in cash the

Exchange of Certificates; Lost Certificates; Escrow Agent

 

. The Escrow Agent shall act as disbursing agent in effecting the payment of
cash for certificates which, immediately prior to the Closing, represented
shares of Company Stock ("Certificates") and which are converted into the
right to payment pursuant to Section 2.02. At or after the Effective Time,
each Stockholder shall surrender to the Company Certificates, together with a
duly executed Letter of Transmittal, representing the number of shares of
Company Stock held by such holder. On the date hereof or, with respect to any
Certificates that have not been surrendered to the Company on the date hereof,
one (1) Business Day after surrender of such Certificates, the Escrow Agent
shall pay each Stockholder that has surrendered to the Company his, her or its
Certificates, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock
powers, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the amount of
cash to which he, she or it is entitled under Section 2.02. Surrendered
Certificates shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged,
each such Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive the
Stockholders\' Merger Consideration into which the shares it theretofore
represented shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.02, and neither
the Escrow Agent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay the
holder thereof the cash to which he, she or it would otherwise have been
entitled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact
by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
the providing of an indemnity by such Person, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall remit the
Stockholders\' Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the share(s) of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, in the amounts, at the times,
and in the manner contemplated

   

by this Article II. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any Stockholder for Stockholders\' Merger
Consideration delivered to a Governmental Body if such delivery is required
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

Options

 

.

 

(a)At the Effective Time, each Optionholder shall become entitled to receive
in respect of such Option that is vested, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock such holder could have
purchased if such holder had exercised such Option in full (and paid the
applicable exercise price in respect thereof) immediately prior to such time,
multiplied by (B) (x) the excess of the Per Share Portion of the Estimated
Closing Cash Proceeds over the applicable exercise price per share of such
Option (collectively, the "Optionholders\' Closing Consideration") and (y) the
Per Share Portion of any Adjustments, in each case, after taking into
consideration the rights of the Participants to any portion of such
consideration pursuant to the Incentive Bonus Plan. 

 

(b)The Surviving Corporation shall act as paying agent in effecting the
payment of the Optionholders\' Closing Consideration and the Participants\'
Closing Bonus Pool through the Surviving Corporation\'s payroll system on the
next regularly scheduled payroll date after the date hereof. The Surviving
Corporation (or any other Person that has any withholding obligation with
respect to any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.04) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payments to be made pursuant to this Section
2.04 any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payments under the Code or any other applicable provision of Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Optionholder or Participant, as applicable, on behalf of whom such deduction
and withholding was made. Furthermore, in order to ensure compliance with all
applicable Tax withholding requirements, the Representative or the Escrow
Agent at the Representative\'s direction may pay or direct payment of any
funds which are to be paid to or for the benefit of the Optionholders or
Participants (including any portion of the Optionholders\' Merger
Consideration and any portion of the Participants\' Total Bonus Pool) to the
Surviving Corporation and have such amounts paid through the Surviving
Corporation\'s payroll system on the next regularly scheduled payroll date
after the date of receipt of such amounts. Upon payment of any such amounts
to the Surviving Corporation, the Representative or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, shall be relieved of its obligation to pay such amounts to the
Optionholders or Participants, as applicable.

 

Certificate of Incorporation

 

. As of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated pursuant to the terms set forth in
the Certificate of Merger, and as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

Bylaws

 

. The bylaws of the Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that the title thereof shall read
"Bylaws of Infiltrator Water Technologies Ultimate Holdings, Inc.") and, as so
amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable Law.

   

Directors and Officers

 

. From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or
appointed in accordance with applicable Law (or their earlier resignation or
removal), the directors and officers of the Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the directors and officers, as applicable, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Withholding

 

. The Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation (and any other Person that has
any withholding obligation with respect to any payment made pursuant to this
Agreement) and the Representative and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or such other Person is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable provision of Law; provided, that the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or such other Person shall provide the Representative
with reasonable notice prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.08 (other than any such amounts subject to payroll withholding), and
shall work in good faith with the Representative (at the Representative\'s
expense) to minimize any such withheld amounts. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and are timely paid over to the applicable Tax authority in
accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Appraisal Rights

 

. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder that has demanded and perfected a demand for appraisal for
such shares of Company Stock in accordance with Delaware Law Section 262
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but instead shall only be entitled to the rights
provided under Delaware Law Section 262. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist
and (b) the holder or holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to them under Delaware Law Section 262;
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under
Delaware Law, the right of such holder to such appraisal of its shares of
Company Stock shall cease, and such shares of Company Stock shall be deemed
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, as provided in this Article II.

Closing Cash Proceeds Adjustment

 

.

 

(a)As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting
forth the Purchaser\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, in each case in accordance with the definition
thereof, and a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet
shall (i) be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles, and Cash,
Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital (subject to the specific
adjustments set forth on the Working Capital Schedule) shall be determined, in
accordance with the respective definitions of each set forth herein and (ii)
not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the consummation of the Closing except as provided in the
definitions of Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses.

   

(b)The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) shall (i) permit the Representative and its representatives
to have reasonable access to the books, records and other documents (including
work papers (upon execution and delivery of customary accountant access
letter(s)), schedules, financial statements, memoranda, etc.) pertaining to or
used in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement or the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Purchaser\'s calculation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds and provide the Representative with copies thereof (as reasonably
requested by the Representative) and (ii) provide the Representative and its
representatives reasonable access to the Purchaser\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
(including the Surviving Corporation\'s and its Subsidiaries\') employees and
advisors (including making their accountants available to respond to
reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Representative or its
representatives); provided, in each case, that such access shall be in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates. If the Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchaser\'s
calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the Closing Statement
or the Closing Balance Sheet, the Representative shall, within thirty (30)
days after the Representative\'s receipt of the Closing Statement and the
Closing Balance Sheet, notify the Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by
setting forth the Representative\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). Any part of the
Purchaser\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the
Closing Statement or Closing Balance Sheet that is not properly objected to in
an Objection Notice shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. If
an Objection Notice is delivered to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds. In the event
that the Purchaser and the Representative are unable to resolve all such
disagreements within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser\'s receipt of such
Objection Notice or such longer period as the Purchaser and the Representative
may mutually agree in writing, the Purchaser and the Representative shall
submit such remaining disagreements to Duff and Phelps, or a
nationally‑recognized valuation or consulting firm and/or independent
accountant as is acceptable to the Purchaser and the Representative (the
"Valuation Firm").

 

(c)The Valuation Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, and
make a final and binding determination with respect to the Purchaser\'s
computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on Exhibit D as soon
as reasonably practicable. The Purchaser and the Representative shall
cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Valuation Firm to resolve all
remaining disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, as soon as practicable.
The Valuation Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Purchaser\'s and the Representative\'s respective calculations of the Closing
Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, that are in the
Objection Notice and identified as being items and amounts to which the
Purchaser and the Representative have been unable to agree, and the Valuation
Firm may not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
value or less than the smallest value for such item calculated by either
party. Except as permitted on Exhibit D hereto in order to clarify or
understand any position or argument made by a party in a written submission,
the Valuation Firm\'s determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on written presentations
submitted by the Purchaser and the

   

Representative and the terms and standards set forth in this Agreement (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review). The determination of the
Valuation Firm shall be in writing, shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review except in
the case of manifest clerical error or fraud.

 

(d)The fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party in the written
presentation to the Valuation Firm. For example, if the Purchaser claims the
Closing Cash Proceeds are one thousand dollars ($1,000) less than the amount
determined by the Representative, and the Representative contests only five
hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the
Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Purchaser three
hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars ($500) contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated sixty percent (60%)
(i.e., 300/500) to the Representative and forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200/500)
to the Purchaser. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative, on
the other hand, shall retain the Valuation Firm and each pay fifty percent
(50%) of any retainer. During such engagement, the Valuation Firm will bill
fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to the Purchaser, on the one hand,
and fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to the Representative, on the
other hand. In connection with the Valuation Firm\'s determination of Closing
Cash Proceeds, the Valuation Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the terms
of the first and second sentences of this Section 3.03(d), and taking into
account all fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm already paid by
each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other
hand, as of the date of such determination, the allocation of the Valuation
Firm\'s fees, costs and expenses between the Purchaser and the Representative,
which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto.

 

(e)Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, is finally determined pursuant to this Section
3.03:

 

(i)if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this Section
3.03 are less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, then the Purchaser and
the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to: (A) pay to the Purchaser
solely and exclusively from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds an
amount (which in no case shall exceed the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount) (the "Purchaser Adjustment Amount") equal to such deficiency, and (B)
pay to the Representative or to the Escrow Agent at the Representative\'s
direction the amount (if any) by which the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds is greater than the Purchaser Adjustment Amount; and

 

(ii)if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.03 are greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, then (A)
the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one or more
of its Subsidiaries to, pay to the Representative or to the Escrow Agent at
the Representative\'s direction an amount (which in no case shall exceed the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount) equal to such excess, and (B) the
Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Representative or to

   

the Escrow Agent at the Representative\'s direction an amount equal to all of
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds.

 

All payments to be made pursuant to this Section 3.03(e) shall (x) be treated
by all parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and (y) be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Purchaser or
the Representative, as applicable. Each of the Purchaser, the Stockholders
and the Optionholders hereby agrees and acknowledges that his, her or its
right to any payment to be made pursuant to Section 3.03(e) shall be their
sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims arising under this Agreement
with respect to this Section 3.03.

Proceeds.

material customer of, or from any material supplier or third party to, the

materially affect the level of inventory required to supply such customer

by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing for
the benefit of such individuals for an aggregate period of not less than six
(6) years with respect to claims arising from acts, events or omissions that
occurred at or prior to the Closing, including with respect to the

the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and (ii) not to amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely
affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as
required by Law, it being the intent of the parties hereto that the
indemnitees and exculpees to whom this Section 6.02 applies shall continue to
be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification provisions (including with
respect to advancement of expenses). The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that this Section 6.02 shall be binding on the Purchaser\'s successors and
assigns.

 

(c)If the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other

of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.02.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Closing) is made against any individual who is an indemnitee or exculpee
to whom this Section 6.02 applies, on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.02 shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 

(e)The obligations under this Section 6.02 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee or exculpee to whom
this Section 6.02 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee or
exculpee. The provisions of this Section 6.02 are intended for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by (as express third‑party beneficiaries), each
such indemnitee or exculpee and his or her heirs and representatives,
successors and assigns and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have had by Contract or otherwise.

. The Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 10, 2019, by and between
the Purchaser and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall,
without further action of any party, terminate and be of no further force or
effect as of the Closing.

 

Payments to Optionholders and Other Individuals

 

. In order to ensure compliance with applicable Tax requirements, any
payments that are compensatory in nature for Income Tax purposes and are made
hereunder to any Optionholder, Participant or other individual (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, disbursements of any portion of the Optionholders\'
Merger Consideration, or Total Bonus Pool, but subject to Section 2.04) shall
be made through the payroll processing system of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

Access and Investigation; Non‑Reliance

facilities and officers, directors, employees and other representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting a due diligence

satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and
projected operations of the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective joint ventures and businesses, and, in making its determination to
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Purchaser and the Merger Sub and each of their respective Non‑Recourse Parties
(i) have relied solely on the results of such independent investigation and
verification and on the representations and warranties of the Company

representations and warranties expressly and specifically made by the
Stockholders in their respective Letters of Transmittal), as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, and (ii) have not relied on any other representations,
warranties or statements (including by omission) of any kind or nature,

condition, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or conformity to
samples) of any of the Company, the Stockholders and Optionholders, the
Representative or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties as to any
matter concerning the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective joint ventures or businesses or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or with respect to the
accuracy or completeness of any information provided to (or otherwise acquired
by) the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or any of their respective Non-Recourse
Parties in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any statements,
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other materials made
available to the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or any of their respective Non-
Recourse Parties in certain "data room" or presentations, including
"management presentations"). In connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub has been represented by, and
adequately consulted with, legal counsel of their choice and each of the
Purchaser, the Merger Sub and such counsel has carefully read this Agreement
and has been given time to consider this Agreement, understands this Agreement
and, after such consideration, and with such understanding, the Purchaser and
the Merger Sub have knowingly, freely and without coercion entered into this
Agreement and, in particular, this Section 6.05 and Section 7.01.

respective Letters of Transmittal), as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules,
constitute the sole and exclusive representations, warranties, and statements
(including by omission) of any kind or nature, whether written or oral,
expressed or implied, statutory or otherwise (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, relating to quality, quantity, condition, merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose or conformity to samples) of any of the Company, the
Stockholders and Optionholders, the

   

Representative or any of their respective Non‑Recourse Parties as to any
matter concerning the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective joint ventures or businesses or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or with respect to the
accuracy or completeness of any information provided to (or otherwise acquired
by) the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or any of their respective Non‑Recourse
Parties in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any statements,
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or any of their respective
Non‑Recourse Parties in certain "data rooms" or presentations including
"management presentations") and all other purported representations and
warranties or statements (including by omission) are hereby disclaimed by the
Company, the Stockholders and Optionholders, the Representative and each of
their respective Non‑Recourse Parties and (i) each of the Purchaser and its
Non‑Recourse Parties has and will only rely on the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set forth in Article IV
and the representations and warranties expressly and specifically made by the
Stockholders in their respective Letters of Transmittal, (ii) each of the

and (iii) none of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or any of their respective
Non‑Recourse Parties shall have any claim with respect to their purported use

acquiring the Company, its Subsidiaries, its joint ventures and their
respective businesses on an "AS IS, WHERE IS" basis. Without in any way
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser and the Merger Sub
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
projections, forward looking statements and other forecasts and estimates, and
certain business plan information, that the Purchaser and the Merger Sub are
familiar with such uncertainties, that the Purchaser, the Merger Sub and their
Non‑Recourse Parties are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of any such projections, forward
looking statements, forecasts, estimates and business plan information
provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the Purchaser, the Merger Sub and their
respective Non‑Recourse Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such projections, forward looking statements,
forecasts, estimates and business plan information). Under no circumstances
shall any of the representations and warranties of the Company made herein be
imputed to, or deemed to have been made by, any other Person (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Representative or any Stockholder).

. From time to time following the Closing, as and when requested in writing
by any party hereto and at such requesting party\'s expense, any other party
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
further or other actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem
necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries to continue the employment effective immediately after the
Closing of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including each
such employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as of

are employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately following the
Closing are referred to as "Retained Employees". The Purchaser will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide each such Retained Employee who
remains employed with at least the same base wages, annual base salary and
annual rate of cash bonus potential (determined as a percentage of annual base
salary) (but excluding any equity plan program or arrangement) provided to
each such employee on the date hereof for a period of at least one (1) year
following the date hereof; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
7.03(a) shall obligate the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to continue the employment of any such Retained Employee for any specific
period.

 

(b)Employee Benefits. For a period of at least one (1) year following the
date hereof, the Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide, each Retained Employee with benefits (other than any
equity-based compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
the benefits provided to such Retained Employee immediately prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser may
provide better benefits in the aggregate than the benefits provided to such
Retained Employees immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c)Severance. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.03,
the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, pay severance benefits to Retained Employees whose employment
with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is involuntarily
terminated other than for cause within twelve (12) months following the date
hereof in amounts no less favorable than the amount of severance benefits to
which such persons would have been entitled under the terms of the applicable
Employee Benefit Plan as in effect as of the date hereof.

 

(d)Employee Service Credit. The Purchaser (i) shall give, or cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to give, each Retained Employee credit under any
benefit plan or personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee after the
Closing, including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and
severance benefits for the Retained Employee\'s service with the Company and
its Affiliates prior to the Closing, to the same extent recognized by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof as of the date hereof,
(ii) shall allow such Retained Employees to participate in each plan providing
welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance, long‑term disability
insurance and long‑term care insurance) without regard to
preexisting‑condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability
or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing, and
(iii) if any welfare benefit plan or Canadian Welfare Plan is terminated prior
to the end of the plan year that includes the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
credit the Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by such
welfare benefit plan(s) or Canadian Welfare Plan(s)

   

for purposes of determining deductibles, co‑pays and other applicable limits
under any similar replacement plans.

 

(e)Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. The Purchaser shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all
vacation and personal holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to
use but has not used as of the date hereof (including any earned vacation or
personal holiday pay to be used in future years), and shall assume all
liability for the payment of such amounts.

 

(f)No Third‑Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 7.03 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee, officer, director, manager or consultant, or any other
individual associated therewith, shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third‑party beneficiary of this Section 7.03. In no event shall the terms of
this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Employee
Benefit Plan or any other "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by the Company, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or

program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with the Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee.

 

Post-Closing Bonus Amounts

 

. The Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Subsidiaries to, pay to each Participant any additional amount due (if any)
pursuant to the Incentive Bonus Plan in excess of the portion of the Closing
Bonus Pool paid to such individual at Closing (such additional amount, in the
aggregate across all Participants, the "Post-Closing Bonus Pool") and, in each
such case, any portion of the Post-Closing Bonus Pool owed to such
Participant, if any, shall be taken into account in determining the Merger
Consideration payable to the Stockholders and the Optionholders following the
Closing and such portion of the Post-Closing Bonus Pool shall be paid to each
Participant pursuant to Section 6.04 at such time or times as distributions
are made to the Stockholders and Optionholders. Prior to the payment of any
of the Post-Closing Bonus Pool, the Representative shall deliver to the
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation a schedule setting forth the amount
owed to each eligible Participant and the Surviving Corporation shall pay to
each Participant the amount set forth on such schedule pursuant to this
Section 7.04.

 

Article VIII 
NO SURVIVAL OR CLAIMS FOR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Survival

 

. None of the representations or warranties in Article IV or Article V shall
survive the Closing and each such representation and warranty shall terminate
on and as of the Closing, and no claims may be brought with respect to such
representations or warranties from or after the Closing other than (i) the
Purchaser or any additional insureds under the RandW Insurance Policy against
the insurers thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof or (ii) to the
extent expressly permitted by the last sentence of Section 8.02. All of the
covenants in this Agreement

   

which are to be performed at or after the Closing shall survive for the time
periods specified therein and shall terminate once such covenants are fully
performed.

 

Exclusive Remedy; Exceptions

 

. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser\'s and its Non-Recourse Parties\'
sole and exclusive remedy against the Representative, the Stockholders, the
Optionholders and each of their respective Non‑Recourse Parties, whether in
any individual, corporate or any other capacity, with respect to any and all
claims relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed
(whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, on
public policy grounds, under any Law (including under securities Laws or RICO)
or otherwise, shall be solely and exclusively for breach of any agreement or
covenant to the extent provided in Section 8.01, the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement or the terms and conditions of each Stockholder\'s Letter of
Transmittal or, if applicable, Support Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Purchaser and the Merger Sub each hereby waives and releases to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each Stockholder, each
Optionholder, the Representative and each of their respective Non‑Recourse
Parties, whether in any individual, corporate or any other capacity, from and
against any and all other rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against any Stockholder, any Optionholder, the Representative or any of their
respective Non‑Recourse Parties relating (directly or indirectly) to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including relating to any exhibit, Schedule or document delivered hereunder),
including whether arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise and
including any rights to rescission of the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than claims for breach of any agreement or covenant herein surviving,
and requiring performance at or after, the Closing to the extent provided in
Section 8.01, the provisions of the Escrow Agreement or the terms and
conditions of each Stockholder\'s Letter of Transmittal or, if applicable,
Support Agreement. The limits imposed on the Purchaser\'s and its Non-
Recourse Parties\' remedies with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including this Section 8.02) were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically
taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to the
Stockholders and Optionholders hereunder. None of the Purchaser or any of its
Non-Recourse Parties may avoid the limitations on liability set forth in this
Agreement by seeking damages for breach of Contract, tort or pursuant to any
other theory of liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in Section
8.01 or this Section 8.02 shall limit a party\'s right to (i) seek specific
performance of the other parties\' obligations under any covenant herein
surviving, and requiring performance at or after, the Closing in accordance
with Section 10.17 or (ii) bring a claim for Fraud.

attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery")
shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as

agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, or the
applicable signed agreement,

   

instrument or amendment, or any amendments hereto or thereto, shall re execute
the original form of this Agreement and deliver such form to all other parties

forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to
lack of authenticity. Minor variations in the form of the signature page,
including footers from earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other
document, will be disregarded in determining a party\'s intent or the
effectiveness of such signature.

transactions contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (c) agrees
that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be

CROSS‑CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR (ii) THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF. 

 

Representative

 

.

 

(a)Effective upon and by virtue of the Stockholder Approval, and without any
further act of any of the equityholders of the Company, the Representative is
hereby irrevocably appointed as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney
in fact (coupled with an interest) for all of the equityholders of the Company
for all purposes under this Agreement including the full power and authority
on such equityholders\' behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (ii) to
negotiate claims and disputes arising under, or relating to, this Agreement
and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds contemplated by Section 3.03), (iii) to
receive and

   

disburse to, or cause to be received or disbursed to, any equityholder of the
Company any funds received on behalf of such equityholder under this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any portion of the Merger
Consideration) or otherwise; provided, however, that in each such case, any
amounts owed to any Participant, if any, shall be taken into consideration in
determining the Merger Consideration payable to the equityholders of the
Company and paid to the Participants pursuant to Section 6.04 and Section 7.04
in connection therewith, (iv) to withhold any amounts received on behalf of
any equityholder of the Company pursuant to this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any portion of the Merger Consideration) or to satisfy any
and all obligations or liabilities of any equityholder of the Company or the
Representative in the performance of any of their commitments hereunder
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the satisfaction of payment
obligations in connection with the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds
contemplated by Section 3.03), (v) to execute and deliver any amendment or
waiver to this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, and documents
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (without the prior
approval of any equityholder of the Company), (vi) to receive and disburse to,
or cause to be received or disbursed to, any individual pursuant to any
incentive compensation agreement providing for a transaction bonus, in effect
as of the Closing and (vii) to take all other actions to be taken by or on
behalf of any equityholder of the Company in connection with this Agreement
and the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith. Such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative
and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or
liquidation of each equityholder of the Company. All decisions and actions by
the Representative shall be binding upon each equityholder of the Company, and
no such equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The Representative shall have no duties or
obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary duties, except those set forth
herein, and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b)Effective upon and by virtue of the Stockholder Approval, and without any
further act of any of the equityholders of the Company, the Representative and
its Non‑Recourse Parties shall be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed by
each Class A Stockholder severally (based on each Class A Stockholder\'s Pro
Rata Percentage), and not jointly, against all costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid or incurred by
the Representative and its Non‑Recourse Parties in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding to which the Representative or such other Person is
made a party by reason of the fact that it is or was acting as the
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the satisfaction of payment obligations in connection with
the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds contemplated by Section 3.03). Any
and all amounts paid or incurred by the Representative and its Non‑Recourse
Parties in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which the
Representative or such other Person is made a party by reason of the fact that
it is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement are on behalf of the equityholders of the Company (and, not for the
avoidance, on behalf of the Representative in any other capacity, as a
Stockholder or otherwise).

 

(c)Neither the Representative nor any of its Non‑Recourse Parties shall incur
any liability to any equityholder of the Company by virtue of the failure or
refusal of the Representative or any of its Non‑Recourse Parties for any
reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of their duties hereunder. The Representative

   

and its Non‑Recourse Parties shall have no liability in respect of any action,
claim or proceeding brought against any such Person by any equityholder of the
Company, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, if any such Person took or
omitted taking any action in good faith.

 

(d)If the Representative pays or causes to be paid any amounts in connection
with any obligation or liability of an equityholder of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds contemplated by
Section 3.03), any such payments and the reasonable expenses of the
Representative incurred in administering or defending the underlying dispute
or claim may be reimbursed, when and as incurred, from the Representative
Holdback Amount (and, if not so reimbursed from the Representative Holdback
Amount, the Representative shall be indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed
by each Class A Stockholder severally (based on each Class A Stockholder\'s
Pro Rata Percentage), and not jointly, for such amount(s)). The
Representative may, in its sole and absolute discretion, distribute, or cause
to be distributed, any or all of the funds received or held by it on behalf of
the equityholders of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
portion of the Merger Consideration) to one (1) or more of such equityholders
at any time after the date hereof, which such distribution(s) of funds may be
different (i.e., with respect to amount, timing, conditionality or otherwise)
for each such equityholder. Upon full reimbursement of all expenses, costs,
obligations or liabilities incurred by the Representative in the performance
of its duties hereunder, the Representative shall distribute, or cause to be
distributed, all remaining funds held by it on behalf of the equityholders of
the Company to such equityholders.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
Representative and its Affiliates shall not be liable for any loss to any
equityholder of the Company for any action taken or not taken by the
Representative or for any act or omission taken or not taken in reliance upon
the actions taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made,
given or executed by the Purchaser or the Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(f)All references to the "Representative" herein mean such Person in its
capacity as representative of the equityholders of the Company and not, for
the avoidance of doubt, in any other capacity, as a Stockholder or otherwise. 

 

(g)Except as may have been expressly and specifically agreed to in writing by
an equityholder of the Company, on the one hand, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP
("KandE LLP"), on the other hand, and except for the Representative, Ontario

not and is not representing, and shall not be deemed to have represented any
equityholder of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) KandE LLP has not and is not providing any advice or counsel

counsel or advice, to any equityholder of the Company in connection with the

kind, any actual or potential conflict or other actual or potential objection
with respect to KandE LLP\'s representation of the Representative, Ontario
Teachers\' Pension Plan Board, and their respective Affiliates in any matter
related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(h)The Purchaser shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Representative
on all matters relating to this Agreement and, subject to receipt of
notification of the appointment of a new Representative (with the provisions
of this Section 10.13 applying equally to such new Representative), shall be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
the Stockholders or the Optionholders by the Representative, and on any other
action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Stockholder or
Optionholder by the Representative, as being fully binding upon such Person.
Notices or communications to or from the Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each Stockholder or Optionholder. Any decision or action by
the Representative hereunder, including any agreement between the
Representative and the Purchaser relating to the defense, payment or
settlement of any claims under this Agreement, shall constitute a decision or
action of all Stockholders and Optionholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Person. No Stockholder or Optionholder shall have
the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same.

. Following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company

Representative, the Stockholders, the Optionholders and their respective
Non‑Recourse Parties, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any continued
representation of any other Person (including the Representative, Ontario
Teachers\' Pension Plan Board and their respective Affiliates), and each of
the parties hereto (on behalf of itself and each of its Non‑Recourse Parties)
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. The
decision to represent any of the Representative, the Stockholders, the
Optionholders and their respective Non‑Recourse Parties shall be solely that
of any such Company Counsel. Any attorney‑client privilege, work product
protection or expectation of confidentiality arising out of or as a result of
any Company Counsel\'s representing of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in any matter relating in any way to Ontario Teachers\' Pension Plan Board\'s
and its Affiliates\' pre-Closing ownership of or investment in the Company or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Privileges") shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
full force and effect; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement or any Company Document, the Privileges and all information,
data, documents or communications, in any format and by whomever possessed,
covered by or subject to any of the Privileges (collectively, "Privileged
Materials") shall, from and after the Closing, automatically be assigned and
exclusively belong to, and be controlled by, the Representative. For the
avoidance of doubt, as to any Privileged Materials, the Purchaser, the Merger
Sub and the Company (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation),
together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree
that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Materials in any
action or claim against or involving any of the parties hereto or any of their
respective Non‑Recourse Parties after the Closing, and the Representative,
Ontario Teachers\' Pension Plan Board and their respective Affiliates shall
have the right to assert any of the Privileges against the Company (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries.

Person effective as of the Closing. The Surviving Corporation shall cause
each of its future direct and indirect Subsidiaries and its and their
successors and assigns that are not signatories to this Agreement to fulfill
and comply with the terms of this Section 10.13 and take any and all other
steps necessary to effect the agreements in this Section 10.13.

 

Sources of Recovery; Non-Recourse Parties

 

. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly
provided in Section 3.03(e) or the last sentence of Section 8.02, and remedies
pursuant to the express terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the
Letters of Transmittal and Support Agreements, none of the Stockholders, the
Optionholders, the Representative nor any of their respective Non-Recourse
Parties, shall have any liability, responsibility or obligation arising under
this Agreement or any exhibit or Schedule hereto, or any ancillary agreement,
certificate or other document entered into, made, delivered, or made available
in connection herewith, or as a result of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, the foregoing being the sole and exclusive remedies for all
claims, disputes and losses arising hereunder or thereunder or in connection
herewith or therewith, whether purporting to sound in contract or tort, or at
law or in equity, or otherwise.

. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that all documents or other items
delivered in writing (including by electronic mail) to the Purchaser or its

Business Day prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to have been delivered,
provided or made available to the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or their
representatives for all purposes hereunder.

 

Conflict Between Transaction Documents

 

. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and
provisions of this Agreement are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict
with any term, condition or provision of any other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement shall govern and control.

 

Specific Performance

 

. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each party shall be entitled to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other party, in any
court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief shall be
granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or
order of specific performance shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in
addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. The parties shall not assert that a remedy of
specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and shall not assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the
parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. No party pursuing an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of

   

this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.17 will be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection therewith.

 

Relationship of the Parties

 

. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute the parties hereto

business or other separate entity, nor, except as expressly and specifically
set forth in Section 10.12, in any manner create any principal‑agent,
fiduciary or other special relationship between the parties hereto. No party
shall have any duties (including fiduciary duties) towards any other party
hereto except as specifically set forth herein.

 

Prevailing Party

 

. Other than with respect to disputes arising pursuant to Section 3.03, in
any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, any of the exhibits
or schedules hereto, or any agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated hereby, or any transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the
applicable adjudicating body shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the
costs and attorneys\' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in
connection with the dispute and the enforcement of its rights under this
Agreement, any of the exhibits or schedules hereto, or any agreement,
document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby and, if the
adjudicating body determines a party to be the prevailing party under
circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims
and counterclaims, the adjudicating body may award the prevailing party an
appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys\' fees reasonably incurred
by the prevailing party in connection with the adjudication and the
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, any of the exhibits or
schedules hereto, or any agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated hereby or thereby. The Representative shall be entitled to
satisfy any obligations owed pursuant to this Section 10.19 from the
Representative Holdback Amount.
