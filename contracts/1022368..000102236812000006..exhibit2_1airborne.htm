estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet of the Company and a statement
calculating the Working Capital of the Company prepared in accordance with
GAAP and the methodology set forth on Schedule 2.3(a) (GAAP together with and
as modified by such methodology, the "Accounting Principles," and such good
faith estimate, the "Preliminary Statement") setting forth Seller's estimate
of the Working Capital as of the Closing Date (such amount, the "Estimated
Working Capital"), together with all related work papers. Pursuant to Section
2.2, the Purchase Price shall be (i) increased by the amount that the

absolute value, the "Working Capital Surplus"), or (ii) decreased by the
amount that the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital (such absolute value, the "Working Capital Deficit"); provided, that

may review the Closing Balance Sheet of the Company and the calculation
regarding Working Capital of the Company and may make inquiry of the
representatives of Buyer's accountants and Buyer, who shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller (including, without limitation, by providing Seller

after receipt of the Final Statement of any objections thereto (the "Notice of
Disagreement") setting forth a specific description of Seller's objection(s),

Statement, Seller will be deemed to have accepted the Final Statement
delivered by Buyer, and such Final Statement will be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder.

the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Working Capital. If, at the
end of the Private Resolution Period, Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve
all of the objections set forth in the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Buyer shall engage Ernst and Young LLP (the "Auditor") to resolve any remaining
objections, which decision shall be final and binding on both parties. The
parties agree that they will request that the Auditor render its decision
within thirty (30) days after referral of the dispute to the Auditor for
decision pursuant hereto. In resolving any disputed item, the Auditor shall
(a) be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, and the definitions included
or referred to herein, (b) limit its review to matters still in dispute as set
forth in the Notice of Disagreement (and only to the extent such matters are
still in dispute following such Private Resolution Period) and (c) further
limit its review solely to whether the Closing Balance Sheet and Final
Statement have been prepared in accordance with this Section 2.3. The fees and
expenses of the Auditor relating to disputes pursuant to this Section 2.3
shall be equitably allocated by the Auditor, based on the accuracy of the
parties' respective calculation of Working Capital as of the Closing Date
relative to the Final Working Capital. The date on which the Closing Balance
Sheet and Working Capital of the Company is finally determined in accordance
with Section 2.3(c) or this Section 2.3(d) is hereinafter referred to as the
"Working Capital Determination Date." The accepted or finally determined
Working Capital of the Company (whether determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c)
or this Section 2.3(d)) is referred to as the "Final Working Capital."

  

  

(e) Adjustment. Promptly, and in any event no later than the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the Working Capital Determination Date:

immediately available funds an aggregate amount equal to, the Excess
Consideration, and Buyer and Seller will each direct the Escrow Agent to

Agent to pay to Buyer from the Working Capital Escrow Account, an aggregate
amount equal to the Shortfall Consideration by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, and Buyer and Seller will each direct the Escrow Agent to

If the funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account are insufficient to make
the payment to Buyer set forth in clause (ii) of this Section 2.3(e), Seller
or Parent will pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds an
aggregate amount equal to the excess of the absolute value of the Shortfall
Consideration over the funds in the Working Capital Escrow Account.

  

  

(iii) If the Final Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Working Capital,
Buyer and Seller will each direct the Escrow Agent to release the full amount
of the Working Capital Escrow Amount to Seller.

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

  

  

7.1 Non-solicitation.

  

  

(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending three (3) years
following the Closing Date (the "Non-Solicitation Term"), Seller and Parent
will not, either directly or indirectly through any of their Affiliates or
otherwise, (i) induce or attempt to induce any Person employed by the Company
immediately following the Closing Date to leave the employ of the Company or
(ii) in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company and any
Person employed by the Company immediately following the Closing Date while
such person is an employee of the Company; provided, however, that the
foregoing will not prohibit Seller, Parent or any of their Affiliates from
making generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in the
media (including trade media) or by engaging search firms to engage in
searches that are not targeted or focused on the employees of the Company.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 34 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) In the event of a breach by Seller or Parent of any covenant set forth in
Section 7.1(a), the term of such covenant will be extended by the period of
the duration of such breach.

  

  

(c) Seller and Parent acknowledge that the covenants of Seller and Parent set
forth in this Section 7.1 are an essential element of this Agreement and that,
but for the agreement of Seller and Parent to comply with these covenants,
Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement. Seller and Parent
acknowledge that this Section 7.1 constitutes an independent covenant that
shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision
of this Agreement by Buyer. Seller and Parent have independently consulted
with their counsel and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set
forth in this Section 7.1 are reasonable and proper. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Section 7.1 were not performed by Seller, Parent or their Affiliates in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money
damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties hereto
agree that, in addition to any other remedies, Buyer shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Section 7.1 by a decree of specific performance
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.
Seller and Parent hereby waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy.

  

  

7.2 Repayment of Indebtedness. The Company shall cause all Indebtedness to be
paid off and all Encumbrances (other than liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable) on the Company's assets relating thereto to be released at or prior
to the Closing, other than with respect to the Copier Lease.

  

  

7.3 Confidentiality Agreement of Seller and Parent. Seller and Parent
acknowledge and agree that all Confidential Information (as defined below)
regarding the Company known or obtained by Seller and Parent, whether before
or after the date hereof, is the property of the Company. Therefore, Seller
and Parent agree that each will not, at any time, disclose or cause to be
disclosed to any unauthorized Persons or use or cause to be used for its own
account or for the benefit of any third party any Confidential Information
regarding the Company, whether Seller or Parent has such information in its
memory or embodied in writing or other physical form or any computer readable
format, without Buyer's prior written consent, unless and to the extent that
disclosure is required by applicable Law (in which event such Seller or
Parent, as applicable, shall give Buyer as much notice of such disclosure as
is practicable and permitted by Law and shall cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's
cost and expense, to obtain appropriate protective orders or similar
protection). Seller and Parent agree to deliver to Buyer, or at their option
to destroy (and confirm in writing), at any time following the Closing as
Buyer may reasonably request, all documents, memoranda, notes, plans, records,
reports, summaries and other documentation, models, components, devices, or
computer software, whether embodied in a disk or in other form (and all copies
of all of the foregoing), relating to the business, operations, or affairs of
the Company and any other Confidential Information regarding the Company
and/or Buyer that Seller or Parent, as applicable, may then possess or have
under its control, provided Seller and Parent shall each be entitled to retain
Confidential Information to the extent required to comply with, or as may be
necessary for purposes of establishing compliance with, applicable legal or
regulatory requirements. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" shall mean any and all business, tax or financial information and
any and all information, however documented, that is a trade secret within
the meaning of applicable statutory or case law concerning the business and
affairs of the Company, or Buyer, whether or not marked as "secret" or

statements; financial projections and budgets; historical and projected sales;
and capital spending budgets and plans; and (iii) any and all notes,
analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and other material prepared by or
for the Company, or Buyer containing or based, in whole or in part, on any of
the foregoing information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this
Agreement, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (i)
is or becomes generally known to the public or available for use by the public
other than as a result of breach of this Section 7.3 or breach of any other
Person known by Seller or Parent to be bound by a duty of confidentiality to
Buyer or the Company, (ii) is known to Parent or Seller prior to Parent or
Seller receiving such Confidential Information or (iii) becomes available to
Seller or Parent on a non-confidential basis, from a source (other than Buyer,
the Company or any of their respective employees or representatives) who is
reasonably believed by Seller or Parent to be entitled to disclose such
information without breach of confidentiality to the Company or Buyer. This
Section 7.3 shall terminate two (2) years following the Closing Date.

denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the

Buyer shall be entitled to attend any meetings or conferences with any Tax
Authority relating to such Tax Contests at which Seller or any of its

after the Closing, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

  

  

(f) Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to the amount of any refund of Taxes of
the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any pre-Closing
portion of any Straddle Period which refund is actually recognized by Buyer or
its subsidiaries (including the Company) after the Closing, net of any cost to
Buyer and its Affiliates attributable to the obtaining and receipt of such
refund, except to the extent such refund arises as the result of a carryback
(if made in compliance with Section 7.4(h)) of a loss or other Tax benefit
from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, such
refund was included as an asset in the calculation of Final Working Capital,
or such refund relates to a Buyer Closing Date Tax. Buyer shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Seller any amount to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the
prior sentence within two (2) Business Days of the receipt of the applicable
refund by Buyer or its subsidiaries. To the extent such refund is subsequently
disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax Authority, Seller
agrees promptly to repay the amount of such refund, together with any
interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Tax Authority,
to Buyer.

  

  

(g) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use and other
similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) imposed on
or in respect of the sale of the Company Shares to Buyer ("Transfer Taxes")
will be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. Each party hereby agrees to file
in a timely manner all necessary documents (including, but not limited to, all
Tax Returns) with respect to all such amounts for which such party is liable.
Each party shall provide the other party with evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the other party that any such Transfer Taxes payable by the first party
have been timely paid. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(h) Limitations on Amended Returns and Carrybacks. Without the prior written
consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Buyer shall
not amend any Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period or carryback any Tax attributes from any Post-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

(i) Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision to this Agreement, each
of Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to Seller or any other Person such amounts as each of Buyer, the Company and
the Escrow Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax
law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made. The parties hereto agree to provide Buyer or to
assist Buyer in obtaining, Forms W-8 and/or W-9 or such other forms relating
to Buyer's obligations to withhold as Buyer may reasonably request. For the
avoidance of doubt, (1) any income earned in respect of the Escrow Amount
shall be taxable to Buyer (and any income tax shall be paid by Buyer from its
own funds) and (2) to the extent any amounts are required to be so withheld
from any distributions from the Escrow Amount, such amounts required to be
withheld shall be distributed to Buyer (or an entity designated by Buyer) to
enable Buyer (or any such designated entity) to comply with its withholding
obligations (including without limitation, any obligations of the Company).

  

  

(j) Severance Deductions. The parties agree that the Tax benefits of any
Severance Payments and Transition Payments shall be allocated between the
Parties as follows (regardless of whether such payments are made or such Tax
benefits arise in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, a Straddle Period or a Post-
Closing Tax Period): the Tax benefits associated with $250,000 of such
payments shall inure to the Buyer's benefit and the Tax benefits associated
with all remaining payments shall inure to the Seller's benefit. Accordingly,
(1) to the extent that less than $250,000 of the Severance Payments and
Transition Payments are deductible in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or the post-
Closing portion of a Straddle Period), the payments made by Seller to Buyer
under Sections 7.4(b)(i) and/or (b)(iii) in respect of the Company's Income
Tax Returns shall be increased so as to transfer the benefits of the shortfall
in post-Closing deductions to Buyer and (2) to the extent that more than
$250,000 of the Severance Payments and Transition Payments are deductible in a
Post-Closing Tax Period (or the post-Closing portion of a Straddle Period),
the payments made by Seller to Buyer under Sections 7.4(b)(i) and/or (b)(iii)
in respect of the Company's Income Tax Returns shall be reduced so as to
transfer the benefits of the shortfall in pre-Closing deductions to Seller.

  

  

(k) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payments made to any party
pursuant to Section 7.4(a) (Tax Indemnity) or Article VIII (Survival and
Indemnification) shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by Buyer, the Company and Seller on
their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

  

  

7.5 Public Announcements. No party shall, without the approval of each of the
other parties, issue any press release or make any other public announcements
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby or the contents of this
Agreement, except as and to the extent that such party shall be so obligated
by applicable Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange. Upon the
prior written consent of Seller, which Seller shall not unreasonably
withhold, condition or delay, Buyer shall issue a press release relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

7.6 Obligations to Continuing Employees. Buyer will cause each employee
benefit plan or program or service-based policy of Buyer in which employees
who continue to be employed by Buyer after the Closing are eligible to
participate to take into account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan) and levels of benefits thereunder, the pre-Closing service of
such employees as if such service were with Buyer to the same extent that
such service was recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Closing
under the comparable Benefit Plan; provided, that such crediting of service
does not result in any duplication of benefits. Buyer shall provide, or cause
to be provided, to any current or former employee of the Company and such
individual's "qualified beneficiaries" (within the meaning of COBRA) whose
"qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA) occurs prior to, on or after
the Closing Date with such COBRA continuation coverage as any such individual
is entitled.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 40 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.7 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification. For a period of six
years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Company's Organizational
Documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of
expenses of any officers and directors (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person")
(unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers
and directors of the Company shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of
the Law; provided that (i) any such provision may be amended or otherwise
modified from time to time so long as such amendment or other modification
does not adversely affect a DandO Indemnified Person's right to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of the Law and
(ii) such officers and directors shall not be entitled to such exculpation,
indemnification and advances of expenses if the need for exculpation,
indemnification or advances of expenses arises from a dispute between Seller
or Parent on the one hand and such officers or directors on the other hand.

  

  

7.8 Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or reasonably desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto will take such further action (including
the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any
other party reasonably may request. The Company and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that from and after the Closing, the Company will continue in
possession of all documents, books, records, agreements and financial data of
any sort relating to the Company.

  

  

7.9 Physical Count of Inventory. Seller shall provide all reasonable
cooperation necessary to permit Buyer and its auditor to conduct a reasonable
physical count of the inventory of the Company, wherever located, on the
Closing Date or the first day or Business Day prior to the Closing Date, or
such other time reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

8.1 Survival. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
terminate at the Closing, except (i) that the representations and warranties
made in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.25, 5.1, 5.3, 6.1 and 6.4 (and
any right to claim indemnification in respect of any breach of such
representations or warranties) shall survive for a period of five (5) years
from the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of fraud or willful misconduct.
The obligations of Seller and Parent to provide indemnification under Section
7.4(a) in respect of any Tax Claim not described in the preceding sentence
shall survive for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date. All (a)
covenants and agreements (other than with respect to indemnification by Seller
and Parent in respect of Tax Claims) that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part after the Closing will survive for the period
provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully performed
and (b) covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in their entirety on or prior to the Closing shall terminate at the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim with respect to any breach
of any representation or warranty specified in clause (i) of this Section 8.1
or any breach of a post-Closing covenant (and the indemnification obligations
of the parties hereto with respect to any representation or warranty specified
in clause (i) of this Section 8.1 (including with respect to any Tax Claim))
will continue if a claim for indemnification shall have been given in
accordance with this Article VIII (or Section 7.4(d), in the case of a Section
7.4(d) Tax Claim) on or prior to the date such representation or warranty or
covenant terminates pursuant to this Section 8.1, until such claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 41 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

8.2 Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Seller and Parent hereby agree, following the Closing, jointly and
severally, to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates
(including the Company), and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders, partners, members, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and against any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Parties, arising
out of or relating to or resulting from:

  

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or Seller
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document that survives the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 8.1 (with Losses arising out of or relating
to or resulting from such breach being measured without regard to any
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar materiality qualifiers);

  

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement of Seller or Parent to be
performed following the Closing Date contained in this Agreement;

  

  

(iii) any Transaction Expenses; and

  

  

(iv) Indebtedness outstanding as of Closing (other than the Copier Lease);

  

  

provided that Seller and Parent shall have no liability under this Section
8.2(a) for any Losses reflected as a liability in Final Working Capital. This
Section 8.2(a) shall not apply to indemnification in respect of any Tax
Claims, indemnification for which shall be governed by Section 7.4(a).

  

  

(b) Buyer hereby agrees, following the Closing, to indemnify, defend and hold
Seller, Parent and each of their respective Affiliates, and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, partners,
members, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties"), harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered
by any Seller Indemnified Parties, arising out of or relating to or resulting
from:

  

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document that survives the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 8.1 (with Losses arising out of or relating to or resulting from such
breach being measured without regard to any "materiality," "Material Adverse
Effect" or similar materiality qualifiers); and

  

  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or other agreement of Buyer or the Company to
be performed following the Closing Date contained in this Agreement.

  

  

8.3 Limitations on Indemnity.

  

  

(a) Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct and except with respect
to the Company Fundamental Representations or any Tax Claim not involving the
Company Fundamental Representations, Seller and Parent shall not be liable to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(i)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses therefrom exceeds an
amount equal to $100,000 (the "Basket"), but then for the aggregate amount of
all Losses. Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct and except with
respect to the Company Fundamental Representations or any Tax Claim not
involving the Company Fundamental Representations, in no event shall Seller's
and Parent's aggregate liability to Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses with
respect to the matters contained in Section 8.2(a)(i) exceed ten percent (10%)
of the Purchase Price (the "Cap"). With respect to all representations and
warranties of the Company in this Agreement, including the Company Fundamental
Representations, and all Tax Claims not involving the Company Fundamental
Representations, in no event shall Seller's and Parent's aggregate liability
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses with respect to the matters
contained in Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 7.4(a) exceed the Purchase Price.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 42 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Seller and Parent shall be jointly and severally liable for all indemnity
claims for Losses under Section 8.2 and Section 7.4(a); provided that, except
in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, in no event shall Seller's and
Parent's aggregate liability to Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to the
matters contained in Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 7.4(a) exceed the
respective amounts set forth in Section 8.3(a).

  

  

(c) Except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, Buyer shall not be
liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for any matters contained in Section
8.2(b)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses therefrom
exceeds the Basket, but then for the aggregate amount of all Losses. Except in
the case of fraud or willful misconduct, in no event shall Buyer's aggregate
liability to the Seller Indemnified Parties for Losses with respect to the
matters contained in Section 8.2(b)(i) exceed the Purchase Price.

  

  

(d) The amount of any and all Losses under this Article VIII and Section 7.4
shall be determined net of any Tax benefits actually realized by any party
seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility or
amortization of any such Losses in (i) the taxable year in which the matters
giving rise to the applicable Losses are finally resolved (the "Resolution
Year"), or (ii) any taxable year prior to the Resolution Year.

  

  

(e) In no event shall a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party
be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of punitive
damages unless such amounts are paid to a third party.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.15, Section 7.4 or
this Article VIII, in no event shall any Losses arising out of or relating to
or resulting from any breach of any representations or warranties in Section
4.15 (other than those in Section 4.15(j)) include any Losses arising out of
or relating to or resulting from any Taxes with respect to any Post-Closing
Tax Period or any Straddle Period (or, in either case, any portion thereof)
beginning after the earlier of (1) the date on which Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates first receives any written communication from
either (A) any Tax Authority that such Tax Authority intends to challenge the
specific Tax matter that forms the basis of such breach or (B) any Person
other than a Tax Authority that such Person intends to assert a claim with
respect to the specific Tax matter that forms the basis of such breach or (2)
the date on which Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
sends any written communication to Seller or Parent that the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates intends to assert a claim with
respect to the specific Tax matter that forms the basis of such breach.

  

  

8.4 Procedure for Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which a party (the
"Indemnifying Party") may have liability to the other party (the "Indemnified
Party") hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any
Indemnified Party by a third party, including a Tax Claim other than a Section
7.4(d) Tax Claim (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly, but in no event more than sixty (60) days following such Indemnified
Party's receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Third Party Claim and the amount or the estimated amount of
damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate
shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim) (a
"Claim Notice"); provided that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party
in giving any such notice of a Third Party Claim shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligations hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such delay. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 43 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense at its expense. Once the
Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate
in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its
sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
respect of any Third Party Claim if any Indemnified Party is a party to the
applicable claim or has been actually threatened to be made a party thereto
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim
and provides solely for monetary relief to be satisfied by the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have
the right to assume control of the defense against any Third Party Claim if:
(i) the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense thereof promptly, but
in any event, within the Notice Period; (ii) the Indemnifying Party does not
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence and in
good faith; or (iii) the Third Party Claim (a) seeks non-monetary, equitable
or injunctive relief, (b) seeks monetary damages equal to or in excess of 125%
of the Cap, (c) alleges violations of criminal law, or (c) includes as the
named parties in any such Third Party Claim both a Buyer Indemnified Party, on
the one hand, and Seller Indemnified Party, on the other hand, and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by outside counsel that a conflict
of interest exists under applicable ethical guidelines and that it would be
impermissible to have the same counsel represent both parties. In any such
event, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and employ separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party's expense.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall assume its own
defense and prosecute, appeal, negotiate, resolve, settle, compromise,
arbitrate or otherwise pursue such Third Party Claim, in whole or in part, at
the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided that (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnified Party
shall control such defense, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent; it being understood that the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not
be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 44 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) In the case of a Section 7.4(d) Tax Claim, the provisions of this Section
8.4 shall not apply, and instead the provisions of Section 7.4(d) shall apply.

  

  

8.5 Payments. Following resolution of a claim under this Article VIII or
Section 7.4, payment of all indemnity claims under Section 8.2 and Section 7.4
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII or
Section 7.4, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss that is
the subject of indemnification hereunder.

  

  

8.6 Exclusive Remedy; No Claims Against the Company. Except with respect to
claims based on fraud or willful misconduct or the availability of equitable
remedies, as provided in Section 9.12, the parties hereto expressly
acknowledge and agree that the indemnity rights set forth in this Article VIII
and Section 7.4 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies available to
such party for any breach of any warranty, representation or covenant or other
agreement of any other party to this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Seller
shall, after the Closing, be entitled to seek or recover by contribution or
otherwise any amounts from the Company on account of any breach of any
representation or warranty or covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement prior to the Closing or otherwise.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

Buyer), or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to
be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power

or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

9.4 Attorneys' Fees. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any part

\- 46 -  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth herein, Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Company, Parent and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear all costs,
charges and expenses incurred by such parties in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein;
provided, however, that Seller shall be responsible for all Transaction
Expenses of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the filing fee under
the HSR Act, (ii) all fees and expenses related to auditing the financial
statements of Seller for the period from May 1, 2009 through October 6, 2009
and for the period from May 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012 and (iii) all fees and

9.6 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
Law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the

9.7 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Company, Buyer, Seller and Parent, their heirs,
representatives, successors, and permitted assigns, in accordance with the
terms hereof. This Agreement shall not be assignable by the Company, Seller or
Parent without the prior written consent of Buyer. This Agreement shall not be
assignable by Buyer, except to one or more subsidiaries of Buyer, without the
prior written consent of Seller. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon
any other Person other than the parties hereto any rights, remedies,
obligations or benefits hereunder, except that Article VIII is intended to be
for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

  

  

9.8 Severability. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement (or any part of a provision) shall in no way
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision (or
part of a provision of this Agreement). If a court or arbitrator finds any
provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable as applied to any
circumstance, the court or arbitrator shall then modify the provision to the
minimum extent necessary in order to make such provision enforceable. If,
however, such court or arbitrator cannot or is unwilling to do so, then the
invalid or unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted to provide and
shall be enforced to the maximum extent under applicable Laws, and the parties
hereto agree that the court or arbitrator making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

  

  

9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
its principles or rules of conflicts of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require or permit the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

  

  

9.10 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
