provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), pursuant
to which each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company
(" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive $50.00 in cash,
without interest;

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company, and Merger
Sub deem it fair to, advisable to and in the best interests of their
respective company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger

WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent entering into this Agreement, and incurring
the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Parent is entering into a voting agreement with
certain beneficial owners of Company Common Stock (the " _Stockholders_ ")
pursuant to which, among other things, the Stockholders have agreed, subject
to the terms thereof, to vote all shares of Company Common Stock they own in
accordance with the terms of such voting agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE I._

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the MGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, and the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation and as a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall

accordance with, the MGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT on the Closing
Date, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in the Articles of Merger. As used herein, the " _Effective Time_ " shall mean
the time at which the Merger shall become effective.

 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effects of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger,
and the applicable provisions of the MGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.5. _Surviving Corporation Constituent Documents_. The Articles of
Merger will provide that the charter of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective
Time to be in the form of (except with respect to the name of the Company) the
charter of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the charter of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except with respect to the name
of the Company) the bylaws of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable law.

Section 1.6. _Surviving Corporation Directors and Officers_. The Articles of
Merger will provide that, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of
Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and, in each case, shall hold office from the Effective
Time until his or her respective successor is duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal in

consents, approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, or the consents set forth on _Schedule

the consummation of the Merger.

 



\- 38 -

    

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give to the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of Parent or its

its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’
operations.

(c) Parent acknowledges and agrees to comply with the matters set forth on 
_Schedule 6.1(c)_.

Section 6.2. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each
Continuing Employee, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending one (1) year thereafter (the " _Continuation Period_ "), with (i) base
salary or base wage and target annual incentive opportunities, that are, in
each case, no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate and
target annual incentive opportunities (taking into account annual incentive
compensation payable in either cash or the grant of an equity award) provided
to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee health and welfare benefits
(excluding defined benefit pension benefits and retiree health and welfare)
that are (x) in the case of Continuing Employees employed by the Affiliated
Companies, substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (y) in the case of Continuing Employees employed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries other than an Affiliated Company, at the
discretion of Parent, either substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those (1) provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (2) that are
generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries from time to time. Additionally, Parent agrees that each
Continuing Employee shall, during the Continuation Period, be provided with
severance benefits (including the payment of transitional or notice pay) that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits (including the payment of
transitional or notice pay) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such Continuing Employee pursuant to the applicable Benefit Plan providing
for such benefits and payments in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially

Affiliates (any such plan, a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ ") to be waived with
respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) with
respect to the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, recognize for
each Continuing Employee and his or her dependents credit for applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made in respect of such Continuing
Employee and his or her eligible dependents to the same extent such credit
was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or annual out-of-pocket
limit under any Parent Benefit Plan, and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall have provided adequate data concerning such payments to Parent
in a format reasonably requested by Parent, and (iii) recognize the service
of each Continuing EmployeeÂ’s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries
for purposes of vesting, vacation, paid time off, benefit accrual and
eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent Benefit Plan in which
any Continuing Employee will participate after the

 



\- 39 -

    

 Effective Time, as if such service had been performed with Parent, except
for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would
result in a duplication of benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, such service
shall not be recognized for purposes of eligibility for retirement vesting
under equity plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

(c) Provided that Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide each Continuing Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing during the Continuation Period with the same

day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to making any written communication to Company Employees pertaining
to compensation or benefits matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy
of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time
(but in any event, no more than two (2) Business Days) to review and comment
on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good
faith; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any written
communication to Company Employees so long as the statements contained therein
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby are substantially similar to
previous communications made by the Company in compliance with the provisions
of this sentence.

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating
any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Benefit
Plan in accordance with their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, or (iv) without
limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 10.9_, create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any
Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

partner of any partnership or a trustee of any trust, and (ii) " _Proceeding_
" shall mean any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



\- 40 -

    

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
to provide indemnification to each Indemnified Person in connection with any
Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) on, or arising
directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the fact that such
Indemnified Person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an
officer or director of another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise
or general partner of any partnership or a trustee of any trust, whether
pertaining to any matter arising before or after the Effective Time. In the
event of any such Proceeding, each Indemnified Person will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit or proceeding from Parent and the Surviving Corporation within a
reasonable period of time following receipt by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor; _provided_
that an Indemnified Person shall repay Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
any expenses incurred by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection
with the indemnification of such Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified
Person did not meet the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation as set forth in the Company
Organizational Documents or the MGCL. The Surviving Corporation shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving CorporationÂ’s and any
of its SubsidiariesÂ’ charters and bylaws or similar organizational documents
as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at
the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring (or alleged to
occur) prior to or at the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons;
_provided_ , however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ more than an
amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums paid by the Company
for such insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent and the Surviving Corporation would be required to
expend more than 300% of current annual premiums, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of current annual premiums. In lieu
of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six (6)-year "tail" prepaid officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability insurance
policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
covering each such Indemnified Person for an amount not to exceed 300% of
current annual premiums. If such "tail" policy has been established by the
Company, Parent shall not terminate such policy and shall cause all
obligations of the Company thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall survive the consummation
of the Merger for a period of six (6) years and are expressly intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within
such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims.

 



\- 41 -

    

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to the same extent and under
the same conditions and procedures (and subject to the same conditions,
including with respect to the advancement of expenses) as such Indemnified
Person is entitled on the date of this Agreement under the Company
Organizational Documents (or the corresponding organizational documents of
any Subsidiary of the Company).

Section 6.4.  _Non-Prosecution Agreement_. As of and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with
all the terms and conditions of, and assume all of the obligations of, the
Company under the Non-Prosecution Agreement, including the provisions of the
Non-Prosecution Agreement governing the ability of the United
States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United
States AttorneyÂ’s Office for the Eastern District of New York to determine
that there has been a breach under the Non-Prosecution Agreement.

Section 6.5. _Notice of Breach_. From and after the date of this Agreement and
until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, Parent shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable provide written notice to Company with reasonable
detail upon having Knowledge of the existence of any event or circumstance
that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of
any party hereto to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied.

shall have the right to, and shall upon request by Parent, postpone

the applicable Subsidiary to continue to provide the advisory services
pursuant to the existing Investment Advisory Arrangement with such Private
Fund after the Closing so long as a majority-in-interest (or such higher
percentage as may be required under the applicable Investment Advisory
Arrangement) of the investors consent to the assignment; and (D) that the
consent of such investor will be deemed to have been granted if such investor
does not affirmatively object to such assignment within forty-five (45) days
after the sending of the Fund Negative Consent Notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Private Fund for which an Additional Private
Fund Consent is required as set forth on _Schedule 7.2(b)(ii)_ of the Company

(A) prepare and file proxy materials for the Public Fund shareholder meeting
to approve the Public Fund Shareholder Approval Items as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)(i)_, (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly clear all SEC comments, and (C) request such Public Fund Board to
submit, as promptly as practicable following the mailing of the proxy

shareholders meeting the proposal to approve the Public Fund Shareholder
Approval Items. The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of the proxy
materials (and any SEC comments thereto) on a timely basis and Parent shall
have the right to review in advance of submission to the SEC the
proxy materials (and any amendment or supplement thereto) to be furnished to
the shareholders of any Public Fund and to (1) approve information or data
that is provided by or on behalf of Parent or its Affiliates specifically for
inclusion in such proxy materials, and (2) provide reasonable comments on

transactions contemplated hereby to the extent required by applicable law, and
(ii) make any other filing necessary under any applicable law to satisfy in

(iv) The Company agrees that the information provided by it or any of
its Subsidiaries (or on their behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion
in the proxy materials to be furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund
(other than information that is or will be provided by or on behalf of Parent
or any other third party specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials)
will not contain, as of the date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement
of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Parent agrees that the information provided by it (or on its
behalf) in writing specifically for inclusion in the proxy materials to be
furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund will not contain, as of the
date of such proxy materials, any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(v) The parties agree that a Public Fund shall be deemed a Consenting Client

Public Fund Shareholder Approval (unless such approval is not required as
provided under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)(i)(B)_) has been obtained and is in full
force and effect at the Closing for the Public Fund IAA Approval.

(d) In connection with obtaining the Client consents and other actions
required by this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, at all times prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent promptly informed
of the status of obtaining such Client consents and, upon ParentÂ’s reasonable
request, make available to Parent copies of all such executed Client consents
and make available for ParentÂ’s inspection the originals of such consents and
any related materials and other records relating to the Client consent
process. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with obtaining the
Client consents required under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, Parent shall have
the right to review in advance of distribution any notices or other materials
to be distributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Clients and
shall have the right to have its reasonable comments reflected therein prior

Company or any Subsidiary thereof be required or authorized to offer or grant
any material accommodation or material alteration of terms (financial or
otherwise) in respect of any Client for the purpose of obtaining the Client
consents contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_. 

Section 7.3. _Section_ __ _ 15(f) of the Investment Company Act_.

 

(a) Parent acknowledges that the Company has entered into this Agreement in
reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. In furtherance (and not limitation) of the foregoing,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts
after the Effective Time to conduct its business to enable the following to
be true regarding Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act in relation to
any Public Fund for which any Subsidiary of the Company provides investment
advisory or sub-advisory services: (a) for a period of not less than three
(3) years after the Effective Time (and provided the 75% standard for
disinterested directors is in effect at the Closing), no more than 25% of the
members of the board of directors or trustees of any Public Fund shall be
"interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the
Company, any Subsidiary, Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other
investment adviser for such Public Fund, and (b) for a period of not less
than two (2) years after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall impose an "unfair burden" (within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act, including any interpretations or no-action letters of
the SEC) on any such Public Fund as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any express or implied terms, conditions or
understandings applicable thereto.

 

(b) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall not
engage, and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction that
would constitute an "assignment" (as that term is defined under applicable
provisions of the Investment Company Act and interpreted by the SEC) to a
third party of any Investment Advisory Arrangement between Parent or any of
its Affiliates and any Public Fund, without first using reasonable best
efforts to obtain from the counterparty to such transaction a covenant in all
material respects comparable to that contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

Section 7.4. _Access to Information_.

 

Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and its representatives (including any
financing sources and their representatives) reasonable access during normal
business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
officers, employees, properties, offices, plants and other facilities and to
all books and records, including financial statements, other financial data
and monthly financial statements within the time such statements are
customarily prepared, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent and its
representatives (including any financing sources and their representatives),
consistent with its legal obligations, all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to
the extent that, in the CompanyÂ’s reasonable judgment, (i) providing such
access would result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege, in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used all
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such access,
or (ii) any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity
applicable to the Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to preclude
the other party and its representatives from gaining access to any properties
or information,  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company will inform Parent
of the general nature of the document or information being withheld and
reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide such document or information in a
manner that would not result in violation of law or the loss or waiver of
such privilege. No investigation by Parent or its representatives shall affect
or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement. Parent will hold any such information
that is non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of that certain agreement, dated June 27, 2019 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the Company and Parent.

Section 7.5. _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) preparing and
filing, in consultation with the other party and as promptly as practicable
and advisable after the date of this Agreement, all documentation to effect
all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents
and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or

contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary
to obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations,
consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits,
authorizations, orders and approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (w) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, (x)
make any filings in connection with any 

 



\- 48 -

    

 Regulatory Approvals as promptly as practicable, (y) supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or by any Governmental Entity under any
Regulatory Law, and (z) take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or obtain all Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable. For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees
payable to any Governmental Entity.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_ to obtain all waiting period expirations
or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law
(as defined below), (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other
in connection with any communication, filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party, including by allowing the other party and/or its counsel to
have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of
any communications, filings and submissions (and documents submitted
therewith); (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the
" _FTC_ "), any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, including by
promptly providing copies to the other party of any such written
communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) permit the
other party to review any communication it gives to, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting, substantive telephone call, or conference
with the DOJ, the FTC, or such other Governmental Entity or other person, and
to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC, or any other applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party and/or its counsel
the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings, substantive
telephone calls and conferences, _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may
be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns. Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be provided to the other under this _Section_ __ _
7.5(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the EU
Merger Regulation and all other national, federal or state, domestic
or foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or affecting competition or
market conditions through merger, acquisition or other transaction and laws
relating to change of control or other approvals required from any
Governmental Entity for completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in  _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, Parent
shall use its best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Regulatory Law. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, "best
efforts" shall include taking any and all actions necessary to obtain the
Consents or waiting period expirations of any Governmental Entity required
to consummate the Merger as expeditiously as possible and, in any event,
prior to the Termination Date, including promptly (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to, effecting and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, hold separate, and other
disposition of the businesses, assets, products or equity interests of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any of ParentÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ other
businesses, assets, products or equity interests now owned or hereafter
acquired by Parent, (ii) creating, terminating, or amending any existing
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, (iii) otherwise taking or
committing to any action that would limit ParentÂ’s freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any
businesses, assets, products or equity interests of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) and (iv) making, or causing
any Subsidiaries to make, any commitment, or committing to (or causing any
Subsidiaries to commit to) make any commitment (to any Governmental Entity
or otherwise) regarding the future operations of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) (the " _Regulatory Actions_
"). Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.5 _shall require Parent, the Company or
their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect
to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon consummation of the Closing. Subject to the
obligations to cooperate and consult in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, the Parent
shall, on behalf of the parties, be entitled to direct, control and lead all
communications, discussions, negotiations and strategy, including with respect
to any Regulatory Action or any governmental consent, waiver, authorization
or approval which the Parent may seek to obtain in accordance with the
provisions hereof and the Company shall take all reasonable actions (at the
direction of the Parent) to support the Parent with respect to the process
and strategy for pursuing any such Regulatory Actions and obtaining such
governmental consents, waivers, authorizations or approvals.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including
Governmental Entities (except those contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_,
which shall be governed by that Section), necessary, proper or advisable for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
provide any notices to third parties required to be provided prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not incur any significant expense or liability, enter into
any significant new commitment or agreement or agree to any significant
modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or
certificates in each case, that would have a material adverse effect on the
business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Company shall promptly inform its financial advisors of the CompanyÂ’s
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_. Any violation of this  _Section_
__ _ 7.6_ by any financial advisor of the Company shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ by the Company. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_, the term "Person" means any person, corporation, entity
or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than Parent
or any Subsidiaries of Parent.

 

" _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal for a merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share exchange, business

Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire, directly or indirectly,

more than 20% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, other than the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company,
directly or indirectly through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
representatives, advisors or other intermediaries, may, prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (i) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, so long as any such compliance recommends against any Company
Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent such action is permitted
by _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, or issue a "stop, look and listen" statement, (ii)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person (and its

such Person information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with confidentiality provisions that
are no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the

information that has not been made available to Parent is made available to
such Person, make available or furnish such nonpublic information to
Parent substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person;
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to
take an action described in the foregoing clause (ii) or (iii) if, and only
if, prior to taking such particular action, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Company Superior
Proposal.

 



\- 51 -

    

" _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal (on its most
recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third
party that is not affiliated with the Company to enter into any transaction
involving a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the
CompanyÂ’s financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would be more
favorable to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders than this Agreement, and the Merger,
taking into account all terms and conditions of such transaction (including
any breakup fees, expense reimbursement provisions and financial terms) and
the anticipated timing and prospects for completion of such transaction,
including the prospects for obtaining regulatory approvals and financing, and
any third-party approvals, except that the reference to "20%" in the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference
to "80%". Reference to "this Agreement", and "the Merger" in this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger that are agreed to by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.6(d)_.

 

(c) Except as provided below, at any time prior to the receipt of the Required
Company Vote, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors shall not (1) withdraw, modify

this Agreement or the Merger or (2) approve or recommend any Company
Acquisition Proposal ((1) or (2) a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors (x) may make a
Company Change in Recommendation (i) in response to a Company Intervening
Event, or (ii) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from or arise out of a material
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and which the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors
determines in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, is a Company Superior Proposal, in each case, if and
only if, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties or
standard of conduct required of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors under
applicable law and the Company complies with  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ or
_(y)_ following receipt of a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal
which the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, in
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is a
Company Superior Proposal, may terminate this Agreement for the purpose of
entering into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement (a " _Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal, if, and only if, the CompanyÂ’s
Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties or standards of conduct
of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors under applicable law and the Company
complies with _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, and concurrently with entering into a
Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Company
Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_.

(d) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under  _Section_ __
_ 7.6(c)(x)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) Business
DaysÂ’ prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company
Change in Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
therefor and, during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement in a manner that would make the failure
to effect a Company Change in Recommendation no longer inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties or standards of conduct of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors
under applicable law or (ii) under _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)(x)(ii)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)(y)_ the Company shall provide Parent with four (4)
Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable
in connection with the applicable Company Acquisition Proposal shall require
a new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period) advising Parent
that the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors intends to take such action, and
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Company Superior
Proposal, and the Company shall, during such four (4) Business Day period (or
subsequent two (2) Business Day period), negotiate in good faith with Parent
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Company Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal.

 

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any proposals, discussions, negotiations or inquiries that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and (iii)
the material terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal and
the identity of the Person making any such Company Acquisition Proposal or
with whom such discussions or negotiations are taking place, in each case, if
such request for information, inquiry, proposal or discussions or negotiations
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal. In
addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after
the receipt thereof, provide to Parent copies of any written documentation
material to understanding such Company Acquisition Proposal which is received
by the Company from the Person (or from any representatives, advisors or
agents of such Person) making such Company Acquisition Proposal or with whom
discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any
existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, the Company may waive any such provision to the extent
necessary to allow a Person to privately make a Company Acquisition Proposal
to the Board of Directors of the Company as permitted under this _Section_ __
_ 7.6_. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material details (including any amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such Company Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed as to
the material details of any information requested of or provided by the
Company and as to the material details of all discussions or negotiations
with respect to any such Company Acquisition Proposal and shall provide to
Parent within 24 hours after receipt thereof all copies of any other
documentation material to understanding such Company Acquisition Proposal (as
determined by the Company in good faith) received by the Company from the
Person (or from any representatives, advisors or agents of such Person) making
such Company Acquisition Proposal or with whom such discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent
any material non-public information concerning the Company provided to any
other Person in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal that was
not previously provided to Parent. The Board of Directors of the Company
shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger proposed by Parent in response to any Company
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not take any action to exempt any
Person from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any
applicable law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.

connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim against such party and/or
its directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions

(g) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the term "

deemed to be a reference to "more than fifty (50%) percent".

(h) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the
amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the Company will also pay
to Parent ParentÂ’s reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit

Fee more than once.

by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders or which reduces the Merger Consideration or adversely affects
the holders of Company Common Stock, without approval by such holders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Section 9.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,

rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.
