reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that does not include the words "Symplmed"

Contractor of the Company, on the date of this Agreement and who remains,

(b) The Company hereby expressly represents and warrants that it has or may
have knowledge of certain Proprietary Information. The Company acknowledges
and agrees that all such Proprietary Information is confidential and
proprietary and that a substantial portion of the Purchase Price is being
paid for such Proprietary Information and that it represents a
substantial investment having great economic value to Buyer, and constitutes
a substantial part of the value to Buyer of the Business and the Assigned
Assets. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Buyer would be irreparably
damaged if any of the Proprietary Information was disclosed to, or used or
exploited on behalf of, any Person other than Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. Accordingly, the Company covenants and agrees that it shall not,
and it shall use its best efforts to ensure that any other Person acting on
its behalf does not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, disclose, use
or exploit any such Proprietary Information, for the benefit of the Company
or of any third-party, except that the Company may disclose, use or exploit a
particular item of Proprietary Information if and to the extent (but only if
and to the extent) that such item:

  

(i) is or becomes publicly known or generally known in the industry of the
Business through no act of the Company in violation of this Agreement, or is
obtained from a third party that may lawfully disclose such information
without breaching any obligation of confidentiality applicable to such third
party;

  



  

(ii) is required to be disclosed to or by Order of a Governmental Authority

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in such event, only to the

(c) The Company expressly acknowledges that the covenants contained in
_Sections 5.1(a_ ) and _(b)_ are integral to the sale to Buyer of the
Assigned Assets and that without the protection of such covenants, Buyer would
not have entered into this Agreement, that the consideration paid by Buyer
bears no relationship to the damages Buyer may suffer in the event of any
breach of any of the covenants of _Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.1(b),_ and
that such covenants contain limitations as to time, geographical area and/or
scope of activity to be restrained which are reasonable and necessary
to protect Buyer's business interests. If this _Section 5.1_ shall
nevertheless for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to time,
duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be enforceable to
the extent compatible with applicable laws that shall then apply. The Company
hereby further acknowledges that money damages will be impossible to
calculate and may not adequately compensate Buyer in connection with an actual
or threatened breach by him of the provisions of this _Section 5.1_.
Accordingly, the Company hereby expressly waives all rights to raise the
adequacy of Buyer's remedies at law as a defense if Buyer seeks to enforce by
injunction or other equitable relief the due and proper performance and
observance of the provisions of this _Section 5.1_. In addition, the Company
hereby agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief in respect of
the actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.1_ , and
hereby waives any requirement that Buyer shall be required to post a bond in
connection therewith. Buyer shall also be entitled to pursue any other
available remedies at law or equity, including the recovery of money damages,
in respect of the actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this
_Section 5.1_.

  



  

(d) The Company hereby expressly waives any right to assert inadequacy of
consideration as a defense to enforcement of the non-competition and
confidentiality covenants in this _Section 5.1_ should such enforcement ever
become necessary.

_Section 3.14_  (" _Employees_ "), _Section 3.16_ (" _ERISA_ "), _Section
3.17_  (" _Taxes_ "), _Section 3.21_ (" _Assets and Title_ "), _Section 3.23_

Covenants and agreements required to be performed after the Closing shall
survive the Closing and shall expire in accordance with their terms.

  



  

8.2 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by the Company_ Subject to the limitations and the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify,
reimburse and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any and
all loss, damage (but excluding any consequential, special or punitive
damages unless awarded to a third party in connection with a third Party
Claim), expense (including court costs, amounts paid in settlement, interest,
penalties, judgments, reasonable attorneys' fees or other expenses for
investigating and defending), suit, action, claim, liability or
obligation (collectively, " _Damages_ ") related to, caused by or arising
from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty contained herein or in
any Related Document by the Company, or any allegations by third parties that,
if true, would entitle Buyer and its Affiliates to indemnity under this
Section 8.2(a)(i); (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or
agreement contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Related
Document by the Company, or any allegations by third parties that, if true,
would entitle Buyer and its Affiliates to indemnity under this Section
8.2(a)(ii); (iii) the Excluded Liabilities and any liabilities arising from
the Excluded Assets; (iv) any liabilities of the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising after the Closing Date; (v) any third party or Governmental

forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless
the Company against any Damages related to, caused by or arising from: (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty contained herein or in any Related
Document by Buyer, or any allegations by third parties that, if true,
would entitle the Company to indemnity under this Section 8.2(b)(i); (ii) any
breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Document by Buyer, or any
allegations by third parties that, if true, would entitle the Company to
indemnity under this Section 8.2(b)(ii); and (iii) any and all actions,
suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, in enforcing this
indemnity against Buyer.

  



  

(c) _Damage Calculation_. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages
subject to indemnification, it is understood and agreed between the parties
hereto that to determine if there has been an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation or warranty which is qualified as to materiality or "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " by the party making such representation or
warranty or contains an exception for matters that would not have a material
adverse effect, then such representation or warranty shall be read as if it
were not so qualified or contained no such exception.

  



  

8.3 _Notice of Claims_. Any party seeking indemnification shall give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of the facts and circumstances
giving rise to the claim (the " _Notice_ ") for which such indemnified party
intends to assert a right to indemnification under this Agreement (" _Claims_
"). Failure to give Notice shall not relieve any indemnifying party of any
obligations which the indemnifying party may have to the indemnified party
under this _Article VIII_ , except to the extent that such failure has
prejudiced the indemnifying party under the provisions for indemnification
contained in this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall reimburse an
indemnified party promptly after delivery of a Notice certifying that the
indemnified party has incurred Damages after compliance with the terms of this
_Article VIII_ ; provided, however, the party receiving the Notice shall have
the option to contest any such Damages or its obligations to indemnify
therefor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, at such party's own
cost and expense. Such option shall be exercised by the giving of notice by
the exercising party to the other party within 20 days of receipt of a
Notice. If the parties do not agree upon the amount of Damages, the party
seeking indemnification may seek appropriate legal remedy in accordance with
this Agreement.

8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligation_. The maximum liability of the
Company to Buyer, and of Buyer to the Company, for all Claims and Damages
shall be $300,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap
shall not apply: (i) in the event of fraud or willful misrepresentation by
the indemnifying party; or (ii) to indemnification obligations for Damages in
connection with (x) a breach of the representations and warranties contained
in _Sections 3.1_  (" _No Violation_ "), _3.2_ (" _Due Organization_ "),
_3.3_  (" _Authorization_ "), _3.6_ (" _Licenses_ "), _3.10_  (" _Consents_
"), _3.14_ (" _Employees_ "), _3.16_ (" _ERISA_ "), _3.17_  (" _Taxes_ "),
_3.21_ (" _Assets and Title_ "), _3.23_ (" _Environmental Claims_ ") and
_Section 3.29_ (" _FDA Matters_ "); (y) the indemnification obligations set
forth in clauses (ii)-(vi) and (x)-(y) of _Section 8.2(a)_ ; and (z) the
indemnification obligations set forth in items (ii)-(iii) of _Section
8.2(b)_.

  



  

8.5 _Assumption and Defense of Third-Party Action_. If any Claim by Buyer
hereunder arises out of a claim by a third party or Governmental Authority (a
" _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Company shall have the right, at its own
expense, to participate in or assume control of the defense of the Third-
Party Claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and to settle or
compromise any such Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that such settlement
or compromise shall be effected only with the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall have the right to employ
counsel to represent it if, in Buyer's reasonable judgment, it is advisable
for it to be represented by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by Buyer; provided, that if
representation by the Company's counsel would present a conflict of interest,
then the Company shall reimburse Buyer for the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a
conflict of interest existed. Buyer shall have the right to control the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, notwithstanding the Company's election to
control the defense, if it notifies the Company that it is assuming the
defense of such Claim, whereupon the Company shall be relieved of its
obligations under this _Article VIII_ with respect to such Third-Party Claim.
If the Company does not elect to assume control of the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, the Company shall be bound by the results obtained by Buyer with
respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Company agrees to render such
assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to insure the proper and
adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. It is expressly agreed and
understood that any defense by the Company of any Third-Party Claims
affecting or involving the Business shall not be conducted in a manner which
adversely affects or impairs the value or usefulness of the Business or the
Assigned Assets.

  



  

8.6 _Remedies not Exclusive_. The remedies provided herein shall be
cumulative and shall not preclude the assertion by any party hereto of any
other rights or the seeking of any other remedies, whether at law or in
equity, against any other party hereto.

9.7 _Amendment_. This Agreement shall not be amended, supplemented or
modified except by an agreement in writing which makes specific reference to
this Agreement or an agreement delivered pursuant hereto, as the case may be,
and which is signed by the party against which enforcement of any such

9.8 _Severability_. If in any jurisdiction any provision of this Agreement or
its application to any party or circumstance is held by a court to be
restricted, prohibited or held unenforceable, such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of the restriction,
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction or its application to other parties
or circumstances. In addition, if any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement shall for any reason in any jurisdiction be held by a court
to be excessively broad as to time, duration, geographical scope, activity or
subject, it shall be construed, by limiting and reducing it, so as to be
enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law of such
jurisdiction as it shall then appear.

be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal,
substantive laws of the State of New York, as to all matters, including, but

contained therein. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any New
York State or Federal court sitting in the Southern District of New York, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any
Related Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of
Buyer and the Company hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent they
may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding. Each of Buyer and the Company also
irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the service of any and all process
in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process by
certified mail to such party and its counsel at their respective addresses
specified in Section 9.1.
