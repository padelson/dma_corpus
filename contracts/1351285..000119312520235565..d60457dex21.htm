AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of August 29,
2020, by and among CAMBIUM HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"); EMPOWER MERGER SUB INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "); and ROSETTA STONE INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this Agreement
are defined in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_.

 

RECITALS

 

A. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and the
board of directors of each of Parent and Acquisition Sub have determined that
it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to
acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

 

B. In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the Company by Parent,
it is proposed that Acquisition Sub make a tender offer to acquire all of the
issued and outstanding Company Shares that would be entitled to vote on the
adoption or rejection of this Agreement pursuant to the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), absent the application of Section 251(h)
thereof, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Such tender offer, as it may be amended from time to time, is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer_ ".

 

C. Each Company Share accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be
exchanged for $30.00 (such dollar amount, or any greater dollar amount per
Company Share paid pursuant to the Offer, as such dollar amount may be
adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_, being referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Per Share Amount_ "), net to the seller in cash.

D. It is further proposed that, after acquiring Company Shares pursuant to
the Offer, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the surviving corporation of such Merger, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the merger of
Acquisition Sub into the Company being referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Merger_ ").

E. The Company Board and the respective boards of directors of Parent and
Acquisition Sub have authorized and approved the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the performance by such parties of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

F. The Company Board (1) has determined that the Offer is fair to, and in
the best interests of, the Companys stockholders; and (2) has resolved to
recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

G. The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be
effected as soon as practicable following the consummation (as defined in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1 THE OFFER

 

1.1 Tender Offer.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
and provided that the Company has complied with its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (other than any non-compliance that was immaterial),
unless this Agreement shall have previously been validly terminated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement and in any event within the 10-business day period
commencing on the first business day after the date of this Agreement,
Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer for all of the outstanding Company Shares (including
any Company Shares subject to repurchase rights in favor of the Company), at
a price per Company Share equal to the Per Share Amount. The date on which
Acquisition Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Commencement Date_ ".

(b) As soon as practicable after the later of (i) the earliest time as of
which Acquisition Sub is permitted under the Exchange Act to accept for
purchase Company Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer and (ii) the earliest time as of which each of the Offer Conditions
shall have been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment all Company Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) (the time of
such acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). The obligation of
Acquisition Sub to accept for payment Company Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in _Annex_ __ _ I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ") (and
shall not be subject to any other conditions). As soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time (and in any event no later than two business days after
the expiration of the Offer), Acquisition Sub shall pay for such Company
Shares (the time Acquisition Sub pays for such Company Shares, the " _Offer
Closing_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall (without the prior written consent
of the Company):

(i) change, amend or waive the Minimum Condition or the Termination
Condition ( _provided_ that Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the
right to (but shall not be obligated to) waive any of the Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition) in their
sole discretion);

(ii) decrease the number of Company Shares sought to be purchased
by Acquisition Sub in the Offer so that it is for fewer than all of the
outstanding Company Shares;

 

(iii) reduce the Per Share Amount to be paid pursuant to the Offer (
_provided_ that Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the right to
(but shall not be obligated to) increase the Per Share Amount to be paid
pursuant to the Offer in their sole discretion);

 



2

    

(iv) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time of the Offer (except
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_);

(v) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

(vi) impose any condition to the Offer (other than the Offer Conditions)
or amend, modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or any of the other
terms of the Offer in any manner adversely affecting, or that would reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect on, any of the holders of Company
Shares ( _provided_ that Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the
right to (but shall not be obligated to) waive any of the Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Condition and the Termination Condition) in their sole
discretion);

 

(vii) provide any "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act; or

(viii) take any action (or fail to take any action) that would result in
the Merger not being permitted to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL.

 

(d) The Offer shall expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date
that is 20 business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the Offer Commencement Date (the "
_Initial Expiration Time_ "), unless the Offer has been extended as provided
in this Agreement (the Initial Expiration Time or such later expiration time
to which the Offer has been so extended being referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Expiration Time_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, at the
then-scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has
not been waived, then (A) Acquisition Sub may extend the Offer and the
Expiration Time beyond the Initial Expiration Time for one or more periods of
up to 10 business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) each to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied and (B) to
the extent requested by the Company from time to time, Acquisition Sub shall
extend (and re-extend) the Offer and the Expiration Time beyond the then-
scheduled Expiration Time for one or more periods of up to 10 business days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) each to
permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided_ that Acquisition Sub
shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date, nor shall
Acquisition Sub extend the Offer beyond the End Date without the Companys
prior written consent; and (ii) Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer and the
Expiration Time for the minimum period required by any applicable
Legal Requirements. The Offer may not be terminated prior to the then-
scheduled Expiration Time unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, then Acquisition Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) immediately, irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer, and Acquisition Sub shall not acquire or
pay for any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated
or withdrawn by Acquisition Sub in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall promptly return, and Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Acquisition Sub to return,
all Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer to the registered holders
thereof. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_ shall affect any
termination rights set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_.

 



3

    

(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_, if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Acceptance Time, the outstanding Company Shares are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate.

 

1.2 Actions of Parent and Acquisition Sub.

 

(a) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause
to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer, which will contain or incorporate by reference Acquisition Subs
offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal (the forms of which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and the related documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto
being referred to collectively in this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_
"). Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
cause the Offer Documents to be timely disseminated to holders of Company
Shares to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to comply with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give the Company and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (and Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall reasonably consider in good faith the inclusion of any such comments
provided in a timely manner) on the Offer Documents (including any amendment
or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and prior to
the dissemination thereof to the Companys stockholders. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy
or a description of any comments received by Parent or Acquisition Sub (or by
counsel to Parent or Acquisition Sub) from the SEC or its staff with respect
to any of the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents or the Offer and give the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (and Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall reasonably consider in good faith the inclusion of any such comments
provided in a timely manner) any response to such comments proposed to be
provided to the SEC or its staff.

(b) To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (i) each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirements; and (ii) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take
all steps necessary to promptly cause the Offer Documents, as supplemented or
amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares. The Company shall promptly furnish
to Parent and Acquisition Sub, for inclusion in the Offer Documents, all
information concerning the Company and its stockholders required under
applicable Legal Requirements to be included in the Offer Documents or as is
otherwise reasonably requested by Parent or 

 



4

    

 Acquisition Sub, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
financial statements of the Company, but will include the Fairness Opinion and
all other material disclosures relating to the Financial Advisor (including
the fees and other consideration that the Financial Advisor will receive upon
consummation of the Offer and the Merger) that are required by applicable U.S.
federal securities Legal Requirements.

 

(c) Parent shall cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub on a timely basis
all of the funds necessary to purchase any Company Shares that Acquisition
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and shall cause
Acquisition Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of Acquisition Subs
obligations under this Agreement.

 

(d) The parties to this Agreement expressly elect to have this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby governed by Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause the Merger to be effected as
soon as practicable following the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h)
of the DGCL) of the Offer.

 

1.3 Actions of the Company.

 

(a) On or as promptly as practicable after the Offer Commencement Date, and
in any event within one business day after the Offer Commencement Date, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule_ __ _ 14D_ _-9_ ") that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_, shall
contain the recommendation of the Company Board that stockholders of the
Company tender their Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ "). Following or contemporaneously with the initial
dissemination of the Offer Documents to holders of Company Shares, to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, the Company shall
disseminate to holders of Company Shares the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
(and the Company shall reasonably consider in good faith the inclusion of any
such comments provided in a timely manner) on the Schedule 14D-9 (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC
or the dissemination thereof to holders of Company Shares; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company need not give Parent and its counsel such
opportunity to review and comment in connection with any amendment
or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 that relates to any Acquisition Proposal
or any Change in Recommendation. The Company shall promptly provide Parent and
its counsel with a copy or a description of any comments received by the
Company (or its counsel) from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and give Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (and the Company
shall reasonably consider in good faith the inclusion of any such comments
provided in a timely manner) any response to such comments provided to the
SEC or its staff; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company need not give
Parent and its counsel such opportunity to review and comment in connection
with any such response or comments that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or
any Change in Recommendation.

(b) To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (i) each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for 

 



5

    

 use in the Schedule 14D-9 if such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) the Company shall take all steps
necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to
correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and, subject to the final
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)_, to be disseminated to holders of
Company Shares. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent or Acquisition Sub that may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any action contemplated
by this _Section 1.3(b)_. To the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 and any supplement

6

    

 (1) that such Acquisition Proposal would, if this Agreement or the Offer

into, constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) that in light of such

senior management and financial and legal advisors available on reasonable
notice for the purpose of engaging in negotiations with Parent (to the extent

or the Offer or a possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition
Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a
Superior Proposal;

 

(E) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in clause (D)

consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, and
after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that
Parent and Acquisition Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as a
result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (D) above, that (1) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to
effect a Change in Recommendation and/or enter into such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
_provided_ that any material amendment to the terms of such Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not in response to any changes proposed by Parent or
Acquisition Sub pursuant to clause (D) above; it being understood and agreed
that any change in the type or amount of per share consideration or
purchase price shall be considered material) after which such Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal (it being acknowledged and agreed that
clause (1) above shall not be satisfied if any such material amendments result
in such Acquisition Proposal no longer remaining a Superior Proposal), shall
require a new Superior Proposal Notice and an

 



7

    

 additional two-business day period from the date of such Superior Proposal
Notice (during which the terms of clause (D) above and this clause (E) shall
apply _mutatis mutandis_ (other than the number of business days)); and

(F) in the event that the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement concerning such Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_; or

(A) any Change in Circumstances arises or occurs;

 

(B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a
failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements;

 

(C) such Change in Recommendation is not effected prior to the third
business day after Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming
that the Company Board intends to effect such a Change in Recommendation,
which notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, information describing
such Change in Circumstances;

 

(D) during the three-business day period commencing on the date of Parents
receipt of such notice described in clause (C) above, the Company shall have
made its senior management and financial and legal advisors available on
reasonable notice for the purpose of engaging in negotiations with Parent (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of
this Agreement or the Offer or a possible alternative transaction; and

 

(E) at the end of such three-business day period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer
that Parent and Acquisition Sub have irrevocably agreed in writing to make as
a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (D) above, that, in light
of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements.

(e) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer
agent to promptly (and in any event within five business days following the
date hereof) furnish to Acquisition Sub or its designated agent mailing labels

Acquisition Sub may reasonably request for purposes of communicating the Offer
to the holders of Company Shares, in each case, to the extent
reasonably available to the Company or its transfer agent (including after

shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the information

been (or will be when such agreement is executed and delivered) duly executed
and delivered on behalf of Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of such agreement by the other parties
thereto, constitutes (or will constitute when such agreement is executed and
delivered) the valid and binding obligation of Acquisition Sub, enforceable
against Acquisition Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

 

4.4 Non-Contravention; Consents. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not (a) conflict with or
cause a violation of any of the provisions of the Organizational Documents of
Parent or Acquisition Sub; (b) conflict with or cause a violation by Parent
or Acquisition Sub of any Legal Requirement applicable to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, except, with respect to this clause (b), for conflicts or
violations that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parents or Acquisition Subs
ability to perform any of its obligations under, or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement; or (c) cause a default on the
part of Parent or Acquisition Sub under any material contract to which Parent
or Acquisition Sub is a party, except, with respect to this clause (c), for
defaults that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parents or Acquisition Subs
ability to perform any of its obligations under, or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Except as may be required by
the Exchange Act, the DGCL, the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws,
neither Parent or Acquisition Sub nor any of Parents other Affiliates is
required to make any filing with or to obtain any consent from any Person at
or prior to the Effective Time in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub or the consummation by Parent
or Acquisition Sub of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except where the failure to make any such filing or obtain any
such consent would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on Parents or Acquisition Subs ability
to perform any of its obligations under, or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement,. No vote of Parents stockholder
is necessary to adopt this Agreement or to approve any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



36

    

4.5 Not an Interested Stockholder. Neither Parent nor any of its
"affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been within the last three years, an
"interested stockholder" (in each case as such terms are defined in Section
203 of the DGCL) of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has taken, or has authorized or
permitted any of their respective Representatives to take, any action that
would cause either Parent or Acquisition Sub to be deemed an "interested
stockholder" (as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of the
Company. Neither Parent nor any of Parents Affiliates, directly or
indirectly, owns or holds, and since December 31, 2016, neither Parent nor
any of Parents Affiliates has owned or held, beneficially or otherwise, any
Company Shares or any securities, rights or obligations convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Company Shares. Parent has disclosed to the
Company all Contracts, agreements or understandings, if any, between or among
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent, on the one hand, and
any member of the Company Board or any officer, employee or stockholder of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that relate to the
transactions contemplated hereby or the operations of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time.

 

4.6 Financing.

 

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company
accurate and complete copies of (i) fully executed Existing Credit
Agreements, (ii) a fully executed debt commitment letter (together with all
annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto and any fee letters or engagement
letters related thereto, the " _Debt Financing Commitment Letter_ ") from the
lenders party thereto pursuant to which, and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions therein, the lenders party thereto have committed to provide Parent
and Acquisition Sub with debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for
purposes of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, paying
related fees and expenses and refinancing certain outstanding indebtedness of
the Company (such debt financing, and any commitments to provide the Second
Lien Giveaway (as defined in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter), the "
_Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, solely in the case of
any fee letter or engagement letter related to the Debt Financing,
accurate and complete copies have been delivered to the Company with only the
fee amounts, pricing caps, pricing terms and certain economic terms of "market
flex" redacted; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that none of the
redacted terms referred to in the preceding proviso could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the conditionality, availability or aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing or could otherwise expand or amend or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any
holders of Company Shares any of the conditions or other contingencies
relating to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing in any respect
(whether by making any of such conditions or other contingencies less likely
to be satisfied on a timely basis or otherwise); and (iii) a fully executed
equity commitment letter (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits
thereto and any fee letters or engagement letters related thereto, the "
_Equity Financing Commitment Letter_ ", and together with the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from The Veritas Capital
Fund VI, L.P. (" _Sponsor_ ") pursuant to which, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions therein, Sponsor has committed to invest, directly
or indirectly, in Parent the cash amount set forth therein (the equity
financing, the " _Equity Financing_ ", and together with the Debt Financing,
the " _Financing_ "). Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Sponsor has duly executed and delivered to the Company the Limited Guaranty by
Sponsor, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company (the
" _Limited Guaranty_ "). As of the date hereof, the Limited Guaranty (A) is in
full force and effect and (B) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Sponsor, enforceable against Sponsor in accordance with its terms, subject to
the

 



37

    

 Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, (1) there is no default
under the Limited Guaranty by Sponsor and (2) no event has occurred that with
the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by Sponsor.

(b) The Commitment Letters, in the forms provided to the Company by Parent
on or prior to the date hereof, are in full force and effect and are legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent, Acquisition Sub and
Sponsor, as applicable, and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, no
Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded,
amended or modified, in any respect, and no withdrawal, termination,
repudiation, rescission, amendment or modification of any Commitment Letter
is contemplated (other than any customary modification or amendment solely to
join additional lenders to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as
contemplated thereunder, which joinders, individually and in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and the entering into any Second Lien
Giveaway (as defined in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter)).

(c) As of the date hereof, (i) none of Parent, Acquisition Sub or Sponsor,
as applicable, or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto has
committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth
in, or is in default under, any of the Commitment Letters, and (ii) to the
knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, (A) could reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of any Person under
any of the Commitment Letters, or (B) could reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent or other
contingency set forth in any of the Commitment Letters. Parent and Acquisition
Sub have fully paid any commitment fees or other fees payable on or prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with the Commitment Letters. As of
the date hereof, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has received any notice or
other communication from any other party to any of the Commitment Letters
with respect to (1) any actual or potential breach or default on the part of
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other party to any of the Commitment Letters or
(2) assuming each of the conditions set forth in  _Annex_ __ _ I_ have been
met, any actual or potential failure to satisfy any condition precedent or
other contingency set forth in any of the Commitment Letters. Assuming the
Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters and each of the
conditions set forth in _Annex_ __ _ I_ have been met, as of the date hereof,
Parent and Acquisition Sub (both before and after giving effect to any "market
flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letters) have no reason to
believe they will not be able to satisfy on a timely basis each term and
condition relating to the closing or funding of the Financing. To the
knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof (I) no fact, occurrence,
circumstance or condition that could reasonably be expected to (x) cause any
of the Commitment Letters to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated
or rescinded or to be or become ineffective, (y) cause any of the terms or
conditions relating to the closing or funding of any portion of the Financing
not to be met or complied with or (z) otherwise cause the full amount of the
funds contemplated to be available under the Commitment Letters to not be
available to Parent and Acquisition Sub on a timely basis; and (II) there
exists no potential impediment to the funding of any of the payment
obligations of Parent or Acquisition Sub under this Agreement.

 



38

    

(d) There are no, and there will not be any, conditions precedent or other
contingencies relating to the obligation of any party to any of the Commitment
Letters to fund the full amount (or any portion) of the Financing, including
any condition or other contingency relating to the availability of any
"market flex" provisions, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date hereof. There are no side letters and (except
for the Commitment Letters) there are no Contracts, arrangements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with any Person relating to the Debt
Financing under which Parent or Acquisition Sub has or may become subject to
any obligation or that may otherwise affect the availability of the Financing
or any portion thereof.

 

(e) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters,
will provide Parent and Acquisition Sub with funds at the Offer Closing
sufficient to (i) pay all amounts required to be paid by Parent and
Acquisition Sub under or in connection with this Agreement that are required
to be paid at or prior to Closing, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses of
or payable by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Financing, in each case, that are payable at or prior to
Closing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of any
Acquired Company contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Commitment
Letters that is payable at or prior to Closing, and (iv) satisfy all of the
other payment obligations of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving
Corporation contemplated hereunder, in each case, that are payable at or prior
to Closing.

 

(f) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, there is no financing
condition or contingency relating to the obligation of Parent and Acquisition
Sub to consummate the Merger.

 

(g) The Debt Financing as provided for under the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter is permitted to be incurred under the Existing Credit Agreements.

4.7 Solvency. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is entering into
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent or Acquisition
Sub. After giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (a) the Financing (both before and after giving full
effect to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letters),
(b) the payment of the Per Share Amount for each of the outstanding Company
Shares, (c) any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by the
Commitment Letters, and (d) the payment of all other amounts required to be
paid at Closing (including the payment of all related fees and expenses),
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies), taken as a
whole, will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the term "
_Solvent_ ", when used with respect to any Person(s), means that, as of any
date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of such Person(s) will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (A) the
total amount of all liabilities of such Person(s), including contingent and
other liabilities, as of such date, and (B) the amount that will be required
to pay the probable liabilities of such Person(s) on its existing debts,
including contingent liabilities, as such debts become absolute and matured;
(ii) such Person(s) will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged;
and (iii) such Person(s) will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the

 



39

    

 preceding sentence, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person(s) will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due.

 

4.8 Operations of Acquisition Sub. Acquisition Sub (a) has been formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other agreements contained herein, (b) as of the date hereof
has never engaged in any business activities and (c) has never incurred any
Liabilities or obligations, in each case, except (i) as provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement or the other agreements referred to herein,
(ii) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
(iii) in connection with the matters ancillary to the foregoing.

4.9 Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. On the date filed
with the SEC, on the date first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders and at all other times at or prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Offer Documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is
made by Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to any information supplied in
writing by the Company specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents.

 

4.10 Information in Schedule 14D-9. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9
will, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC, at any time
the Schedule 14D-9 is amended or supplemented, or at the time the Schedule
14D-9 is first published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, as
applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

 

4.11 No Other Company Representations or Warranties. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub represents, warrants, acknowledges and agrees that (a) the
Company has not made and is not making any representations or warranties
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3_, (b) it is not relying and has not
relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except as provided in

Representatives has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company
or the other Acquired Companies furnished or made available to Parent or

of such information, or any information, documents or material made available
to Parent or Acquisition Sub in any due diligence materials provided to
Parent or Acquisition Sub, including in the "data room," management

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.12 Non-Reliance on Company Forecasts, Projections, Estimates and
Forward-Looking Statements. Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, each of

other representative of the Company has made or is making any representation
or warranty whatsoever regarding any forecasts, projections, estimates or

financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or the future
business and operations of the Company.

__ _ 5.2_, the Company will not, and will cause the other Acquired Companies,
the officers and directors of the Acquired Companies and the Companys
financial advisor not to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its other representatives not to:

(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiry, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal
(including by approving any transaction, or approving any Person becoming an
"interested stockholder," for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL);

(ii) furnish any information regarding the Acquired Companies to any
Person in response to or in a manner that would reasonably be expected to lead
to, or knowingly in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iii) other than informing Persons of the existence of the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, enter into, participate or engage in or continue
to participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding, with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) agree, propose or resolve to take, or take, any of the
actions prohibited by clauses (i) through (iii) above.

_provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may engage in any such
discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in response to a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if (A) such bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_ (in each case, other than any breach that
is immaterial), (B) prior to providing any material non-public information
regarding the Company to any third party in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, the Company receives from such third party (or there is then in
effect with such party) an executed confidentiality agreement that contains
nondisclosure provisions that are no less favorable to the Company, in the
aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood, however, that such confidentiality agreement need not contain any
standstill provision), (C) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (D) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.
Prior to or within 48 hours after providing any material non-
public information to such third party, the Company shall make such material
non-public information available to Parent (to the extent such material non-
public information has not been previously made available to Parent or any of
Parents Representatives).

 



44

    

(b) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal, then the
Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt of
such Acquisition Proposal) notify Parent in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal (which notification shall include the identity of the Person making
or submitting such Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions
thereof), and shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, as to the status of such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause the other Acquired Companies, the
officers and directors of the Acquired Companies and the Companys financial
advisor to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
representatives to:

 

(i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation
of, or negotiations or discussions with, any Person relating to any
Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) terminate all access granted to any such Person and its
Representatives to any physical or electronic dataroom; and

 

(iii) within five business days following the date hereof, request that any
such Person and its Representatives contemplated in clause (ii) above
promptly return to the Company or destroy (subject to any exceptions in any
applicable confidentiality agreement) any non-public information
concerning the Acquired Companies that was previously furnished or made
available to such Person or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of the
Company.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their
Representatives from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder; _provided_ that any such disclosure does not contain an express
Change in Recommendation; or (ii) making any other disclosures that the
Company Board determines in good faith the failure to make would reasonably
likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ , that the Company
Board shall not effect any express Change in Recommendation except in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_, it being acknowledged and agreed that
the foregoing actions, other than as described in clause (i) of this _Section_
__ _ 5.2(d)_ (which shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Change in
Recommendation), may constitute a Change in Recommendation if it otherwise
satisfies the definition thereof.

 

5.3 Filings; Other Action.

 

(a) Each of the Company, on the one hand, Parent and Acquisition Sub, on
the other hand, shall (i) promptly (and in no event later than the date that
is 10 business days after the date of this Agreement) make and effect all
registrations, filings and submissions required to

 



45

    

 be made or effected by it pursuant to the HSR Act, the Exchange Act and
other applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Offer and the Merger;
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and approvals
required from third parties in connection with the transactions contemplated

take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all actions and steps necessary to
obtain any clearance or approval required to be obtained from the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, any state attorney general,
any foreign competition authority or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any Legal
Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
applicable Antitrust Law, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall (1) vigorously
contest, resist and defend against any such Legal Proceeding; and (2) use its
reasonable best efforts to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
injunction, order, decree, judgment or determination resulting from any such
Legal Proceeding.

made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, each party hereto
will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be present at

_Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Company shall, and shall cause each other Acquired
Company to, (a) provide to Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of any business
conducted by the Company or any other Acquired Company, upon prior written
notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and the other Acquired Companies and to the
books and records of the Acquired Companies; and (b) furnish promptly such
information concerning the Acquired Companies business, properties and
Contracts as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit any inspection or
other access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company would (i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties; (ii) violate any obligation of any Acquired Company with
respect to confidentiality or privacy; (iii) jeopardize protections afforded
any Acquired Company under the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work
product doctrine or any other legal privilege held by any Acquired Company; or
(iv) violate any Legal Requirement;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to allow for such inspection, access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in the disclosure of trade
secrets, violate any such obligation with respect to confidentiality or
privacy, jeopardize such protections or violate any Legal Requirement. All
information obtained by Parent and its representatives pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" of the Company
for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

5.5 Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub. During the period from the date

5.6 Financing Covenants.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause

taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to timely arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing

limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to:

 

(i) use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in full force and effect
the Commitment Letters and the Existing Credit Agreements (or to the extent
superseded thereby, any definitive agreements with respect to the Financing

_Definitive Financing Agreements_ ")) in accordance with the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth therein;

 



47

    

(ii) as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate, execute and deliver (and cause the other
parties to the Commitment Letters to negotiate, execute and deliver) the
Definitive Financing Agreements on terms and conditions no less favorable to
Parent than the terms and conditions (including "market flex" terms and
conditions) contained in the Commitment Letters;

 

(iii) without limiting the effect of _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_, comply on a
timely basis with all covenants and other obligations and use its reasonable
best efforts to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and other
contingencies set forth in the Commitment Letters, Existing Credit Agreements
and Definitive Financing Agreements; 

(iv) pay in a timely manner any commitment or other fees that are or become
payable under any of the Commitment Letters, Existing Credit Agreements or
Definitive Financing Agreements on or following the date of this Agreement;

 

(v) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any rating agency approvals
necessary to obtain the Financing;

(vi) if necessary, comply with any "market flex" provisions contained in
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements in the event
such "market flex" provisions are exercised in accordance with the terms
thereof;

 

(vii) diligently enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters, Existing
Credit Agreements and Definitive Financing Agreements, and if necessary or
appropriate, commence, participate in and diligently pursue Legal Proceedings
against or involving any of the Persons that have committed to provide any
portion of, or otherwise with respect to, the Financing;

(viii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and other
Persons expected to provide Financing to fund the full amount of the
Financing; and

(ix) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing to
be funded in full on or prior to the _Offer Closing_.

 

(b) Without limiting any of its obligations hereunder, Parent shall keep
the Company informed on a current basis in reasonable detail with respect to
the status of the Financing, including the status of Parents and Acquisition
Subs efforts to comply with their covenants and other obligations under, and
satisfy the conditions and other contingencies set forth in, the Commitment
Letters, Existing Credit Agreements and Definitive Financing Agreements.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company and the
Companys legal counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
drafts of all commitment letters and Definitive Financing Agreements. Parent
shall deliver to the Company accurate and complete copies of the Definitive
Financing Agreements promptly after their execution. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give the
Company prompt notice (and in no event later than two business days after
obtaining knowledge) of (i) any actual breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) on the part of
any

 



48

    

 party to any Commitment Letter, Existing Credit Agreement or Definitive
Financing Agreement, (ii) the receipt by Parent or Acquisition Sub of any
notice or other communication from any Person with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default or dispute by or involving any party under any
Commitment Letter, Existing Credit Agreement or Definitive Financing
Agreement, (iii) any actual or purported withdrawal, modification,
termination, rescission or repudiation of any Commitment Letter, Existing
Credit Agreement or Definitive Financing Agreement, or any provision thereof,
(iv) any actual or contemplated dispute or disagreement with any
Person expected to provide any portion of the Financing and (v) any other
circumstance resulting in Parent no longer believing in good faith that it
will be able to obtain, prior to the Offer Closing, all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any
of the Commitment Letters or Definitive Financing Agreements. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within two business days after the
Company delivers to Parent or Acquisition Sub a written request therefor,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested
by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause "(i),"
"(ii)," "(iii)," "(iv)" or "(v)" of the preceding sentence.

(c) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall agree to or permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision
or remedy under, any Commitment Letter, Existing Credit Agreement or
Definitive Financing Agreement if such amendment, modification or waiver (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount); (ii) expands the
conditions or other contingencies relating to the receipt or funding of the
Financing, amends or modifies in a manner adverse to Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Company or any holders of Company Shares any of the conditions or other
contingencies relating to the receipt or funding of the Financing (whether by
making any of such conditions or other contingencies less likely to be
satisfied on a timely basis or otherwise) or imposes new or additional
conditions or other contingencies relating to the receipt or funding of the
Financing; (iii) could reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or delay the
Offer Closing or the date on which the Financing would be obtained or (B)
make the timely funding of the Financing less likely to occur; (iv) adversely
impacts the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to enforce its rights against
any of the other parties to the Commitment Letters, Existing Credit
Agreements or Definitive Financing Agreements; or (v) is otherwise adverse to
the interests of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any holders of
Company Shares in any respect;  _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
(1) Parent may amend the Debt Financing Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, co-managers, syndication agents or other
financing sources who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof in connection therewith, amend the economic and other
arrangements with respect to the appointment of such existing and additional
entities (including in connection with the Second Lien Giveaway), in each
case, in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as
in effect on the date hereof; and (2) Parent shall promptly furnish to the
Company copies of such amendments. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall
agree to or permit the withdrawal, repudiation, termination or rescission of
any Commitment Letter, any Existing Credit Agreement or any provision thereof.

 

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in any of the Commitment Letters or Definitive
Financing Agreements for any reason, or any of the Commitment Letters,
Existing Credit Agreements or Definitive Financing Agreements shall be
withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, 

 



49

    

 then (without limiting any of their other obligations under _Section_ __ _
5.6(a)(vii)_ or otherwise) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable,
from the same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative financing in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and make the payments referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 4.6(e)_, and
on terms and conditions that (i) are not less favorable to Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Company than those set forth in the Commitment Letters, and (ii)
provide no less probability of consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in a timely manner than did the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters at the time they were entered into. In the event any
alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.6(d)_ (" _Alternative Financing_ "), references in this Agreement to the
Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if
one or more commitment letters or definitive financing agreements are entered
into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative
Financing, references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letters and the
Definitive Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such
commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall be applicable thereto to the same
extent as Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations with respect to the
Financing.

(e) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
without the prior written consent of the Company, take or fail to take any
action, or enter into or fail to enter into any transaction, including any
merger, acquisition, business combination, joint venture, sale, disposition,
lease, contract or debt or equity financing, if the taking of or failure to
take such action or the entering into or failure to enter into such
transaction could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent
consummation of the Financing or the funding of any portion thereof.

5.7 Cooperation by the Company.

(a) During the period prior to the Offer Closing, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the other
Acquired Companies and its and their respective directors, officers and
employees to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of
its and their respective other Representatives to, use commercially
reasonable efforts, at Parents sole cost and expense, to cooperate with
Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be
customary and reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that such

business or operations of any Acquired Company), including using commercially
reasonable efforts to do the following, in each case to the extent so

(i) participate at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice in a
reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions, road shows and due

and regulations and (B) OFAC, FCPA and the Investment Company Act, in each
case, to the extent that such documentation and information has been
reasonably requested by Parent in writing at least 10 business days prior to
the Closing Date;

(vi) the extent required by the Debt Financing Sources, executing and
delivering customary authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of Company information to prospective lenders
(including customary 10b-5 and material non-public information
representations); _provided_ that any such letter provides that (A) the
Acquired Companies and their respective Representatives and Affiliates shall
not have any Liabilities of any kind or nature resulting from the use of
information contained in any marketing material and (B) the recipient of any
such letter of authorization agrees that it shall be entitled to rely only on
the representations and warranties contained in the Definitive Financing
Agreements; and

required by the Debt Financing, and (ii) obtaining customary lien releases and
other security releases and other termination documents. 

All information obtained by Parent and its representatives pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" of the
Company for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement and shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
except that the Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information
to rating agencies, the Debt

 



51

    

 Financing Sources and other lenders or potential lenders in accordance with
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter, subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings by such persons regarding such information, which undertakings
are, in all material respects, the same as those in the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Parent shall be responsible for any acts or
omissions of such persons with respect to such information. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _

cost or expense, (C) none of the Acquired Companies shall be required to pay

(D) no director, manager, officer or employee of any Acquired Company shall be
required to deliver any certificate or take any other action pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ to the extent any such action could result in personal
liability to such director, manager, officer or employee, (E) no Acquired
Company or any of its directors or officers shall be obligated to adopt
resolutions or execute consents to approve or authorize the execution of the
Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing) (other than the adoption or
execution of any resolutions or consents effective no earlier than the
Offer Closing by any persons that shall remain or will become officers or
directors of the applicable Acquired Company as of the Offer Closing) or (F)
no Acquired Company will be required to take any action that would reasonably
be expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, to conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any applicable Legal Requirement, any
Contract or obligations of confidentiality (not created in contemplation
hereof) binding on any Acquired Company or adversely impact any attorney-
client privilege of any Acquired Company; _provided_ , _further_ , no Acquired
Company shall be required to provide or obtain any legal opinion or other
opinion of counsel prior to the Offer Closing in connection with the
Financing; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no Acquired Company shall be
required to cause or permit any Lien to be placed on any of its assets in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Offer Closing.

 

(c) The Company shall not have any Liability to Parent in respect of any
pro forma financial statements, other pro forma financial information or data
derived by Parent.

(d) Each Acquired Company hereby consents to the use of its respective
logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ that __ such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Acquired Companies or the reputation or goodwill of
the Acquired Companies.

 



52

    

(e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Companys sole remedies
in the event the Debt Financing is not received are set forth in _Section_ __

the terms and subject to the conditions thereof.

(f) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all costs, including all reasonable and documented fees and

respective officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and
representatives (collectively, the " _Section_ __ _ 5.7 Indemnitees_")
against any and all reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation) and other Liabilities directly
or indirectly suffered or incurred by the Section 5.7 Indemnitees in
connection with the Debt Financing, including any information provided in
connection therewith or the Companys cooperation with respect thereto;
_provided_ that no such indemnity shall be provided in the event of any such
Section 5.7 Indemnitees fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. This _Section_ __ _ 5.7(f)_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and the Effective Time and any termination of this Agreement, and is
intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Section 5.7 Indemnitees and
their respective heirs, executors, estates, personal representatives,
successors and assigns, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent.

5.8 Publicity. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall
be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent. Thereafter,
provided that the Company Board shall not have made a Change in
Recommendation, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub,
on the other hand, shall each consult with the other prior to issuing any
press releases or otherwise making public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a party may, without
complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in Company SEC Documents, to the extent that such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.8_, to the extent such previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements are still accurate; (b) a party may, without
complying with the foregoing obligations, issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement or statement where the management of such
party shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that such disclosure is required by applicable Legal
Requirements or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules
of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity; (c) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_
and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, the Company need not comply with the foregoing
obligations in connection with any press release, public statement or filing
to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (including any
"stop, look and listen" release, which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _
5.2(d)_) or Change in Recommendation; and (d) a party may, without complying
with the foregoing obligations, issue any such press release or make any such
public announcement or statement in connection with any dispute between the
parties hereto regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(f)_ (to the

 



53

    

 extent applicable), the parties shall coordinate with each other and the
others Representatives with respect to communications with employees of the
Acquired Companies regarding post-Closing transition, integration and related
matters; _provided, however_ , that any such communications shall be conducted
at a reasonable time, jointly and under the supervision of personnel of the
Company and conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the normal operation of the business of any Acquired Company. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall prevent
any Affiliate of Parent that is a private equity or similar investment fund,
or any manager or general partner of any such fund, from reporting or
disclosing with respect to fundraising, marketing, informational or reporting
activities, on a confidential basis, to its partners, investors, potential
investors or similar parties, general information regarding this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case subject to customary
obligations of confidentiality with respect to non-public information such as
transaction value or other specific economic terms. For the avoidance of
doubt, any public filings providing notice to or seeking approval from any
Governmental Entity made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall be governed
by _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and not this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 

5.9 Company Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide, without any action on the part of the holder of any

, that to the extent the holder of such Company Option is not and was not at
any time during the applicable vesting period an employee of an Acquired
Company, such amounts shall not be paid through the payroll system, but shall
be paid to such holder by Parent or the Paying Agent.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share

subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Per Share Amount. Each holder of a Company RSU cancelled as provided in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration specified in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_, without interest. Parent shall cause the cash

_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any Company RSU constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such
cash payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
Company Equity Plans and specified in Part 5.9(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is
outstanding and has not been settled immediately prior to the Effective Time

by the Company through Companys payroll system promptly following the
Effective Time (but no later than the second payroll period following the
Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any Company PSU
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code, such cash payment shall be made (without interest) at the earliest time
permitted under the Company Equity Plans and specified in _Part_ __ _ 5.9(d)_
of the Disclosure Schedule.

such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that compliance with 
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ shall be deemed to satisfy this clause "(ii)" for
the period

 



55

    

 commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the last day of the Companys
2020 fiscal year; and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits
(including under any severance plans and health and welfare benefit plans,
but excluding under any equity plans) that are no less favorable than, those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain (without adverse modification)
each cash bonus and/or commission plan and program that is a Company Plan for
the Companys 2020 fiscal year and to pay to each Continuing Employee the
amount of bonus and/or commission actually earned for the 2020 fiscal year by
such Continuing Employee as determined under, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, the Company Plan applicable to such Continuing Employee;
_provided_ , that any employee who is terminated by the Company without
Cause (as defined in the Companys Change in Control Severance Plan,
effective November 1, 2015) shall be entitled to receive the bonus such
employee would have received absent such termination.

 

(c) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Effective Time, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation and leave entitlement and
severance benefits) for service with the Acquired Companies (or predecessor
employers to the extent any Acquired Company provides such past service
credit) under the employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, in which Continuing Employees become participants (the "
_Parent Plans_ "), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Plan; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. As
of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of unused
vacation and sick leave time that such Continuing Employees had accrued under
any applicable Company Plan as of the Effective Time. In addition, (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any Parent Plan to the extent coverage under such Parent Plan
is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee was participating, and (ii) with respect to each Parent Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, Parent shall
(A) cause to be waived any evidence of insurability requirements and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such Parent Plan
to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements and pre-existing
condition limitations requirements would apply under the analogous Company
Plan and (B) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such
Parent Plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar
Company Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Plans for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor, in accordance with their terms, all written Company Plans listed on
_Part_ __ _ 3.14(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter that provide for severance,
change in control or separation, including any such Company Plans established
pursuant to a written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in

 



56

    

 control or termination agreement (including any change in control provisions
therein) between any Acquired Company and any Continuing Employee. Parent
hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall constitute a "change in control" (or similar term) of the Company under
the terms of such Company Plans, if applicable.

 

(e) With respect to any Qualified Plan, if directed by Parent in writing at
least 10 business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
terminate such Qualified Plan, effective not later than the business day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that such Qualified Plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that such Qualified Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and reasonable approval by Parent).

 

(f) Prior to making any written or oral communications to officers or
employees of any Acquired Company pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the transactions, each party will provide the
other party with a copy of the intended communication, the other party will
have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication,
and the relevant party will consider any such comments in good faith.

(g) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.10_ or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended nor shall be construed to
require, and the Acquired Companies shall take no action that would have
the effect of requiring, Parent or the Acquired Companies to continue any
specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific
person. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are for the sole benefit
of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any
particular Company Plan, (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, prevent
the Acquired Companies or Parent from amending or terminating any Company
Plan or any of its benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a
right in any employee, including any Continuing Employee, to employment with
any of the Acquired Companies, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries or (iv) confer upon or give any Person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any current or former employee (including Continuing
Employees), director or independent contractor of the Company), other than
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal
or equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ or otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, including with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
under any benefit plan which Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
may maintain.

 

5.11 Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
compensation committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_
") will cause each Company Plan and Company employment agreement pursuant to
which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a
holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



57

    

5.12 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent will cause the Acquired
Companies, including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies
pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between such Acquired
Company and any Indemnified Party and (ii) any indemnification, exculpation
from Liability or advancement of expenses provision set forth in the
Organizational Documents of such Acquired Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement. The Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation from
Liability and advancement of expenses set forth in the Companys
Organizational Documents on the date of this Agreement and, from and after
the Acceptance Time, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_, during the
period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against and from any Liabilities in connection with any
claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry arises directly or
indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action
or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of any Acquired Company
(with respect to any such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time) or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that, if,
at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Party delivers to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_, then the claim asserted
in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, from
and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, advance, prior to the final disposition
of any claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry for
which indemnification may be sought under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_, promptly following request by an Indemnified Party
therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with any such claim, Legal Proceeding, arbitration, investigation or inquiry.

 

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a prepaid "tail"
policy (the " _Tail Policy_ "), effective as of the Effective Time, which
policy provides the Indemnified Parties with directors and officers
liability insurance with limits and scope consistent with the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance policies in effect as of
the date of this Agreement for a period beginning at the Effective Time and
ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time. Parent
shall cause any such Tail 

 



58

    

 Policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation;
_provided_ , that (i) in no event shall the premiums for the Tail Policy
exceed an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per
annum for the Companys existing insurance coverage for the Indemnified
Parties and (ii) if the aggregate premium amount for the Tail Policy exceeds
such amount, Parent shall obtain a Tail Policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing, for a cost
not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_. 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the Organizational Documents of any Acquired
Company or the Surviving Corporation, under any other indemnification
arrangement, under the DGCL or otherwise. This  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall
survive the Acceptance Time and shall also survive consummation of the Merger
and the Effective Time. This _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ is intended to benefit, and
may be enforced by, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs,
representatives, successors and assigns, and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries. _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ may not be amended, altered or repealed
after the Acceptance Time without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Party.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is or was an
officer or director of any Acquired Company at or at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnified Party_ ".

 

5.13 Section 16 Matters. The Company Board shall, to the extent necessary,
take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Acceptance Time, to approve,
for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition of Company
Shares in the Offer and the deemed disposition and cancellation of Company
Shares and, as applicable, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs in
the Merger by applicable individuals.

5.14 Stock Exchange Delisting. Prior to and following the Effective Time,
the Company (and the Surviving Corporation) shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company Shares to no longer be quoted on the
New York Stock Exchange and to be deregistered under the Exchange Act
effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

5.15 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt
notice of, and copies of all pleadings and correspondence relating to, any
Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its directors or officers by
any holder of Company Shares arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The

 



59

    

 Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in (but not
control) the defense, settlement or compromise of any such Legal Proceeding,
at Parents sole cost and expense, and no such settlement or compromise shall
be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept apprised
of proposed strategy and other decisions with respect to the Legal Proceeding
by the Company (to the extent that, on the advice of outside counsel, the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise materially affected; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to keep Parent apprised of proposed
strategic and other decisions in a manner that does not undermine or effect
attorney-client privilege, including by entering into a joint defense or
similar agreement), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect
to the Legal Proceeding (and the Company shall reasonably consider in good
faith the inclusion or incorporation of any such comments or suggestions
provided in a timely manner), but will not be afforded any decision-making
power or other authority over the Legal Proceeding, except for the settlement
or compromise consent set forth above.

5.16 Takeover Statutes. The parties hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action
reasonably necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to
the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

5.17 Notification of Certain Events.

 

(a) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to disclose in writing to Parent, promptly upon
obtaining knowledge of, the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event
that would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the
satisfaction of any Offer Condition or any condition set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
remedies of the parties hereto under this Agreement.

 

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to disclose in writing to the Company, promptly upon obtaining
knowledge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event that would
be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the satisfaction of any
Offer Condition or any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_; _provided_
, _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the remedies of the
parties hereto under this Agreement.

 

5.18 Director Resignations. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing resignations, effective as of
the Effective Time, executed by each of the directors and officers of the
Company and each of the other Acquired Companies designated by Parent in
writing to the Company not less than five business days prior to the Closing
(if any).

 



60

Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates under the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to the assets and information of the Company and the
other Acquired Companies shall terminate simultaneously with the Closing.

6.1 Consummation of the Offer. Acquisition Sub (or Parent on Acquisition
Subs behalf) shall have accepted for payment and paid for the Company Shares
validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn.

 

6.2 No Restraints. No Order preventing, enjoining, restraining, prohibiting
or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby shall have been issued, enacted, promulgated, enforced or
entered by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and remain in
effect, and there shall not be any Legal Requirement issued, enacted,
promulgated, enforced or entered that makes consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby illegal or prevents, enjoins, restrains
or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

SECTION 7 TERMINATION

Merger may be abandoned:

 

(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time;

 

(b) by Parent or the Company at any time after December 29, 2020 (the "
_End Date_ ") and prior to the Acceptance Time if the Acceptance Time shall
not have occurred on or before the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ if the material failure of such party (including, in
the case of Parent, Acquisition Sub) to perform any covenant required to be
performed by such party (including, in the case of Parent, Acquisition Sub) at
or prior to the Acceptance Time shall have been a proximate cause of the
failure of the Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before the End Date;

 

(c) by Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if
(i) there shall be any Legal Requirement issued, enacted, promulgated,
enforced or entered that prohibits, enjoins, prevents, restrains, or makes
illegal the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) any Governmental Entity shall have
issued, enacted, promulgated, enforced or entered an Order having the effect
of making illegal, restraining, enjoining, preventing or otherwise prohibiting
the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Company Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions

 



61

    

 contemplated hereby, and such Order shall have become final and non-
appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ if the
material failure of such party (including, in the case of Parent, Acquisition
Sub) to perform any covenant required to be performed by such party
(including, in the case of Parent, Acquisition Sub) at or prior to the
Acceptance Time shall have been the proximate cause of the existence of such
Legal Requirement or Order;

 

(d) by Parent or the Company if the Offer (as it may have been extended
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_) expires as a result of the non-
satisfaction of one or more Offer Conditions, or is terminated or withdrawn
prior to the Acceptance Time, without Acquisition Sub having accepted for
payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however_
, that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_ if the non-satisfaction of any Offer Condition,
or the termination or withdrawal of the Offer, was proximately caused by the
material failure of such party (including, in the case of Parent, Acquisition
Sub) to perform any covenant required to be performed by such party
(including, in the case of Parent, Acquisition Sub) at or prior to the
Acceptance Time;

 

(e) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if the Company Board

Company Board has authorized the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; (iii)
substantially concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company
enters into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (iv) the Company and the
Company Board shall have complied in all respects with _Section_ __ _
1.3(d)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal (other than any non-compliance
that was immaterial) and (v) the Company pays the Company Termination Fee
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3_;

(g) by Parent by written notice to the Company at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
in _Section_ __ _ 3_ or failure to perform or comply with any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company shall have
occurred that would cause a failure of the Offer Conditions or any of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ to be satisfied; _provided,
however_ , that, for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_, if such a
breach, inaccuracy or failure is curable by the Company prior to the earlier
of (i) 20 days following the date Parent gives the Company notice of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure and (ii) the End Date, and the Company is
continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach,
inaccuracy or failure, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ on account of such breach, inaccuracy or failure
unless such breach, inaccuracy or failure shall remain uncured upon the
earlier of (A) the expiration of such 20 day period and (B) the End Date;
_provided, further_ , that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ if there is a breach,
inaccuracy or failure such that the Company would have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ (but for any required
notice or cure period associated with such termination right);

 



62

    

(h) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if (i) a breach or inaccuracy, in each case, in any material
respect, of any representation or warranty in _Section_ __ _ 4_ or failure to
perform or comply with, in each case, in any material respect, any covenant
or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Acquisition
Sub shall have occurred, and (ii) such breach, inaccuracy or failure has
prevented, or would reasonably be expected to prevent, Parent or Acquisition
Sub from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_,
if such a breach, inaccuracy or failure is curable by Parent prior to
the earlier of (A) 20 days following the date the Company gives Parent notice
of such breach and (B) the End Date, and Parent is continuing to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, inaccuracy or failure,
then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
7.1(h)_ on account of such breach, inaccuracy or failure unless such breach,
inaccuracy or failure shall remain uncured upon the earlier of (1) the
expiration of such 20 day period and (2) the End Date; _provided, further_ ,
that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ if there is a breach, inaccuracy or failure
such that Parent would have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ (but for any required notice or cure period associated
with such termination right);

 

(i) by the Company if Acquisition Sub (i) fails to commence the Offer on or

the terms of this Agreement; or (ii) terminates the Offer prior to the
Expiration Time, other than in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_; or

 

(j) by the Company if (i) at the Expiration Time (for the avoidance of
doubt, after giving effect to all extensions thereof in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_), all of the Offer Conditions have been and remain
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to such conditions being
able to be satisfied), (ii) the Company has delivered written notice to Parent
to such effect, and (iii) Acquisition Sub fails to consummate (as defined in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer and the Merger within two Business Days

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect, without any Liability on the part of any party
hereto; _provided, however_ , that (a) this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the last
three sentences of _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_, the last sentence of _Section_ __
_ 1.3(e)_, the last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.4_, _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 8_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect; and (b) subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_, the termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any party from any Liability for any intentional
and material breach of this Agreement (which Liability shall include, in the
case of such a breach by Parent or Acquisition Sub, any loss to the
stockholders of the Company of the consideration that would have otherwise
been payable to them). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or
Acquisition Sub to satisfy its obligation to accept for payment or pay for
Company Shares following satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, and any failure
of Parent to cause the Merger to be effected following satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_, will be deemed to constitute an
intentional and material breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this Agreement.

7.3 Company Termination Fee.

 

(a) If (i)(A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_, (B)
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the time of the termination
of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or publicly announced (and such
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the time of the
termination of this Agreement) and (C) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(1) consummates a Specified Acquisition Transaction within 12 months after
such termination or (2) enters into a definitive agreement within 12 months
after such termination providing for a Specified Acquisition Transaction that
is subsequently consummated; (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_; or (iii) this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_, then the
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or its designee, in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) specified by

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Termination Fee shall be
payable only once and not in duplication even though the Company Termination
Fee may be payable under one or more provisions hereof at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events. Acceptance by
Parent of the Company Termination Fee shall constitute acceptance by Parent
of the validity of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.1(f)_. Payment of the Company Termination Fee (plus, if the Company
Termination Fee is not timely paid, the interest described in  _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub
against the Acquired Companies and their respective former, current and future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates,
representatives and agents for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement. Upon payment of the amount referred to in the preceding
sentence, no Acquired Company and no former, current or future officer,
director, partner, stockholder, manager, member, Affiliate, representative or
agent of any Acquired Company shall have any further Liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) If the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, then
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
Parent) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ ) in effect on the date such amount was originally
required to be paid.

7.4 Parent Termination Fee.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(j)_ (or by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b) at a time when the Company could have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 7.1(j)_), then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company or
its designee, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) specified by the Company, at the time specified in the next
sentence, a termination fee in the amount of $55,415,734 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ "). The Parent Termination Fee (if payable) shall be paid by
Parent within two business days following such termination of this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Termination Fee shall be payable only
once and not in duplication even though the Parent Termination Fee may be
payable under one or more provisions hereof at the same or at different times
and upon the occurrence of different events.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
but subject to (v) _ Section 7.2_, (w) _ Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, (x) _ Section_ __ _ 5.7(f)_, (y) an order of
specific performance as, and only to the extent expressly permitted by,
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_ and (z) the Companys rights and remedies under the
Limited Guaranty (subject to the terms thereof): (i) the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement and, if this Agreement is terminated in
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable hereunder,
receive the Parent Termination Fee, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company against (1) Parent, (2) Acquisition Sub, (3) Sponsor, (4) the
Debt Financing Related Parties and (5) any former, current or future general
or limited partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, members,
managers, attorneys or representatives of any Person named in the foregoing
clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4) or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives (collectively, the Persons named in the foregoing clauses (1)
through (5), the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a
result of, relating to or arising out of such termination, this Agreement, the
Equity Financing Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, the
Definitive Financing Agreements, the other agreements referred to herein
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub, the termination of this Agreement or
the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) none
of the Parent Related Parties shall have any Liability or obligation to the
Company or any of its Affiliates as a result of, relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter, the Definitive Financing Agreements, the other agreements
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any
claims or actions arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the termination of this Agreement or the failure to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
(I) the sum of an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee and the amount
payable under _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_ and the amount payable under _Section_
__ _ 5.7(f)_ is intended to serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate monetary
liability of the Parent Related Parties under this Agreement in the event
Parent or Acquisition Sub breaches this Agreement or fails to perform
hereunder, and under no such circumstances shall the Company be entitled to
collect, if due, more than the amounts specified in this clause (I), and (II)
while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_, as the case may be, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ and monetary damages, including all or
any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

 



65

    

(c) If Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due,
then Parent shall pay to the Company interest on such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
Parent) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ ) in effect on the date such amount was originally
required to be paid.

 

7.5 Acknowledgements. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledges and agrees that:

 

(a) (i) the agreements contained in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _
7.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) without these agreements, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub would not enter into this Agreement;

 

(b) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be uncertain and incapable of accurate determination; and

 

(c) the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be uncertain and incapable of accurate determination.

8.2 Waiver.

 

(a) No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy.

 

(b) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

8.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, or
contained in any certificate, schedule or document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall survive the Acceptance Time.

8.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement, the other agreements
referred to herein and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire

8.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

 

(a) This Agreement is made under, and shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements
made and to be performed solely therein, without giving effect to principles
of conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to and submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such
court, (iii) shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court and (iv) shall not
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other Person with respect
thereto.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.5(a), in any Legal Proceeding involving any
Debt Financing Related Party arising out of or in any way relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the provisions of this
Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, without giving 

 



67

    

 effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. Each party
hereto acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any Legal Proceeding involving
any Debt Financing Related Party arising out of or in any way relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought
exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York
(unless the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York)
(together with the appellate courts thereof, the " _New York Courts_ "), and
each of the parties hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New
York Courts for the purpose of any such proceeding. Each party irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees not to assert (i) any objection which it may ever
have to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any New York Court, (ii)
any claim that any such proceeding brought in any New York Court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum and (iii) any claim that any New York Court
does not have jurisdiction with respect to such proceeding.

 

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENT, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT
LETTERS OR THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE
FINANCING). EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 8.5(C)_.

 

8.6 Payment of Expenses. Whether or not Company Shares are purchased
pursuant to the Offer and whether or not the Merger is consummated, each
party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing for, entering
into and carrying out this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

8.7 Assignability; Parties in Interest.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and
inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. This Agreement shall not be assignable by any party without the
express written consent of the other parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section shall be null and void;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each of Parent and Acquisition Sub may (but shall not be
required to), without the prior written consent of the Company, (i) assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or (ii)
collaterally assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any
Debt Financing Source ( _provided_ that, in any such case, no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, of its
obligations hereunder).

 



68

    

(b) Except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1_ (which, from and after
the Acceptance Time, shall be for the benefit of Persons that are holders of
Company Shares who have tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn) Company Shares), _Section_ __ _ 2_ (which, from and after the
Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of Persons who are holders of the
Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), _Section_ __ _

the Indemnified Parties) and the DFS Provisions (to which each Debt Financing
Source shall be an express third-party beneficiary to the extent relating to
the rights or obligation of such Debt Financing Source), nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person, other than the parties hereto, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature.

8.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

8.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one agreement. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
of this Agreement.

8.11 Obligation of Parent. Parent shall ensure that each of Acquisition
Sub and the Surviving Corporation duly performs, satisfies and discharges on a
timely basis each of the covenants, obligations and liabilities of Acquisition
Sub and the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement, and Parent shall
be jointly and severally liable with Acquisition Sub and the Surviving
Corporation for the due and timely performance and satisfaction of each of
such covenants, obligations and liabilities.

 

8.12 Specific Performance.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with

 



70

    

 their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, in addition to any other remedy that a party hereto may have under law
or in equity, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Parent or
Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, of any
covenant or obligation of such party contained in this Agreement, the other
party shall be entitled to obtain (i) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant
(including, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.12(b)_, with respect to the
obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and pay for
Company Shares and the obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger); and
(ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach (including,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.12(b)_, with respect to the obligations of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and pay for Company Shares and the
obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger). In the event that any action
is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party
hereto shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives the defense or
counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto
further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish, or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, prior to the Closing, the Company
shall be entitled to obtain specific performance to cause Acquisition Sub
consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer and the Merger
in accordance with this Agreement if, and only if, (i) with respect to
consummation of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions (other than those Offer
Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Expiration Time) have been and remain satisfied or waived at the time the
Expiration Time, (ii) with respect to the consummation of the Merger, the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ are satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Effective Time), (iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or, assuming the
Equity Financing is funded, will be funded in accordance with its terms, (iv)
the Company has delivered irrevocable written notice to Parent that it is
ready, willing and able to take all action required of it under this Agreement
to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer and to
consummate the Merger and (v) Acquisition Sub fails to consummate (as defined
in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer and to consummate the Merger within
two business days following the Companys delivery of such notice.

 

8.13 Non-Recourse. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger contemplated hereby, may, except to the
extent set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter or the Limited Guaranty, be
made only against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto
and thereto. Other than the Sponsor pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter
or the Limited Guaranty, no person who is not a named party to this
Agreement, including the Debt Financing Related Parties, any past, present or
future affiliate thereof or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, incorporators, members, managers, partners, direct or indirect
equityholders (including stockholders and optionholders), affiliates, agents,
attorneys or representatives (" _Non-Party Affiliates_"), shall have any
Liability (whether in contract or in tort, under any Legal

 



71

    

 Requirements or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger contemplated hereby (as the case may
be) or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger contemplated hereby (as the case may be) or the
negotiation or execution hereof or thereof, and each party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations (other than Liabilities,
claims and obligations of the Sponsor pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter
or the Limited Guaranty) against any such Non-Party Affiliates.

 

8.14 Construction.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires, the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect
that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) As used in this Agreement (i) the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (ii) the
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if";
(iii) the word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive; (iv) the words

Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement.

 

(e) All references to a document or instrument having been made available
to Parent shall be deemed to include the making available of such document or
instrument to Parents counsel, to Parents legal or financial advisor or to
any other representative of Parent, including by posting such document in an
electronic data room.

 

(f) All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer to U.S.

(g) The table of contents, titles and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and do not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



72

    

(h) All references in this Agreement to a Person are also to
its successors (whether by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation or
other business combination) and permitted assigns.

 

(i) When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded and if the last day of such period is not a business day,
the period shall end on the next succeeding business day.

Acquisition Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, subject
in each case to the terms of this Agreement.
