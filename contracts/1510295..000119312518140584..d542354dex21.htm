and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ __ _ 2_," and
together with Merger Sub 1, the " _Merger Subs_ "). The Company, Parent,

and declared advisable and in the best interest of their respective
equityholders, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into the Company, with the Company being the
surviving entity (the " _First Merger_ "), and, immediately thereafter, the
merger of the surviving entity of the First Merger with and into Merger Sub 2,
with Merger Sub 2 being the surviving entity of such second merger (the "
_Second Merger_ ," and collectively with the First Merger, the " _Merger_ ")
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
(ii) the board of directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the
Merger and the issuance of Parent Shares in the First Merger upon the terms

certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a voting agreement with
Parent with respect to the First Merger (the " _Voting Agreement_ ");

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section

regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ ") and (ii) this Agreement,
as well as any other agreements entered into pursuant to this Agreement, will
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury

existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub 2

Company_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the Surviving Company
with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall
continue unaffected by the Second Merger, except as set forth in _Article_ __
_ II_. The Second Merger shall have the effects specified in this Agreement

1.3  _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44114,
at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the fifth Business Day (the " _Closing Date_
") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but

or waived by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

1.4 _Effective Times_.

 

(a) At or promptly following the Closing on the Closing Date, the Company and
Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of First

State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL, and
make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the
Company or Merger Sub 1 under the DGCL. The First Merger shall become

2 (b) Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation

State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 264 of the DGCL and
Section 18-209 of the LLC Act, and make any other filings, recordings or
publications required to be made by the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub 2

may be agreed by the Surviving Corporation and Parent in writing
and specified in the Certificate of Second Merger (the " _Second Merger
Effective Time_ "). At the Second Merger Effective Time (i) each share of the
Surviving Corporation common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be paid

shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only outstanding limited
liability company interests of the Surviving Company.

purposes, (a) the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) this Agreement, including any
amendments thereto, be, and is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization"

EFFECT OF THE FIRST MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

 

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the First
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub 1:

(a) _Per Share Merger Consideration_. Subject to the allocation and election
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_, each share of the common
stock, par value $0.16 2⁄3 per share, of the Company (each a " _Company Share_
", and collectively, the " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal Shares, Company
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Company Shares owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and
in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (each an " _Excluded Company
Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Company Shares_ ") shall be converted
into, and become exchangeable for either (i) $152.27 (the " _Cash
Consideration_ ") or (ii) 1.87 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share (the "
_Stock Consideration_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Parent (each, a " _Parent Share_ " and collectively, the " _Parent Shares_ ").
The applicable Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration, in each case
without interest, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ". At the Effective
Time, all of the Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) shall
cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any
of the Company Shares, and each non-certificated Company Share represented by
book entry (each, a " _Book Entry Company Share_ "), (other than in each case
those representing Excluded Company Shares) shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Merger Consideration and
(with respect to the Stock Consideration) the right, if any, to receive (A)
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_ cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which such Company Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_ and (B) any distribution or dividend pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
4.2(c)_.

 



4 (b) _Cancellation of Company Shares_. Each Company Share that is an Excluded
Company Share shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no
consideration paid in exchange therefor.

(c)  _Treatment of Merger Sub 1 Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub 1 issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

4.2 _Allocation of Per Share Merger Consideration; Election Procedures;
Exchange of Company Shares_.

(a) _Allocation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the number of Company Shares to be converted into the right to receive Cash
Consideration in the First Merger shall be equal to 22,885,359 (the " _Cash
Election Number_ "). The number of Company Shares to be converted into the
right to receive Stock Consideration in the First Merger (the " _Stock
Election Number_ ") shall be equal to the number of Company Shares to be
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (excluding for the avoidance of
doubt the number of Company Shares represented by the Company Equity Awards
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of which
shall be treated solely as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.5_)  _less_ the Cash
Election Number.

(b) _Election Procedures_.

 

(i) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares, (i) at the Effective Time, certificates, or at Parents option,
evidence of non-certificated Parent Shares in book-entry form (" _Book Entry
Parent Shares_ "), constituting at least the amounts necessary for the Stock
Consideration, (ii) at the Effective Time, cash in immediately available
funds constituting at least the amounts necessary for the aggregate Cash
Consideration, and (iii) as necessary from time to time after the Effective
Time, if applicable, any cash and dividends or other distributions with
respect to the Parent Shares to be issued or to be paid pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 4.2(c)_, in exchange for Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(i)_) or
Book Entry Company Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _
IV_ (such cash, certificates for Parent Shares and evidence of Book Entry
Parent Shares, together with the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IV_ with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash
available in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations, funds or accounts typical for (including
having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate cash portion of the Exchange Fund as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the

 



5  Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to
make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly
returned to Parent. The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the
Companys stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their
Certificates and Book Entry Company Shares and shall obtain no rights or
interests in the shares represented thereby.

 

(ii) _Types of Election_ _._ Subject to allocation and proration in accordance
with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_, each record holder of
Company Shares (other than (1) any Company Shares represented by the Company
Equity Awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all of which shall be treated solely as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and
(2) Excluded Company Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Election Deadline shall be entitled to elect to receive in respect of each
such Company Share held by such record holder (A) Cash Consideration (a "
_Cash Election_ ") or (B) Stock Consideration (a " _Stock_ _Election_ ").
Company Shares in respect of which no Cash Election or Stock Election has
been affirmatively made and not revoked shall be deemed to be Company Shares
in respect of which Stock Elections have been made.

 

(iii) _Form of Election and Election Deadline_ _._ (A) Elections pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(ii)_ shall be made on a form (a " _Form of Election_ ")
to be provided by the Exchange Agent for that purpose to holders of record of
Company Shares (other than (1) any Company Shares represented by the Company
Equity Awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all of which shall be treated solely as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and
(2) Excluded Company Shares), together with appropriate transmittal
materials. Elections shall be made by transmitting to the Exchange Agent a
duly completed Form of Election. To be effective, a Form of Election must be
(x) properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent at its
designated office, by 5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) on the Business Day that is two
trading days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly announced
by Parent at least four Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date)
or such other date and time as Parent may publicly announce with the consent
of the Company (the applicable of such date and times described in this
_clause (x)_ , the " _Election Deadline_ ") and (y) (except with respect to
Book Entry Company Shares, in respect of which such other customary evidence
as determined by the Exchange Agent shall be provided in lieu of Certificates)
accompanied by the Certificate(s) representing the Company Shares as to which
the election is being made (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of
such Certificate(s) by a financial institution (including most commercial
banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses) that is a
participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New York
Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange
Medallion Program, _provided_ that such Certificates are in fact delivered to
the Exchange Agent within three trading days after the date of execution of
such guarantee of delivery), together with a duly completed letter of
transmittal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make a Form
of Election (and where applicable, appropriate transmittal materials)
available to all Persons who become holders of record of Company Shares
(other than (1) any Company Shares represented by the Company Equity Awards
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of which
shall be treated solely as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ and (2) Excluded
Company Shares) between the date the Forms of Election are mailed and the
Election Deadline. Parent shall determine, in its reasonable discretion, which
discretion and authority it may delegate

 



6  in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, whether Forms of Election (and
where applicable, appropriate transmittal materials) have been properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive and
binding. A holder of Company Shares that does not submit an effective Form of
Election prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed to have made a Stock
Election.

(iv) _Revocation of Election_ _._ An election may be revoked, but only by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.
Any Certificate(s) representing Company Shares that have been submitted to the
Exchange Agent in connection with an election shall be returned without charge
to the holder thereof in the event such election is revoked as aforesaid and
such holder requests in writing the return of such Certificate(s) or Book
Entry Company Shares. Upon any such revocation, unless a duly completed Form
of Election is thereafter submitted prior to the Election Deadline in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(iii)_,
such Company Shares shall be Stock Election Shares. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and any
Company Shares have been transmitted to the Exchange Agent pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, such Company Shares shall promptly be returned
without charge to the Person submitting the same.

(v) _Proration for Oversubscription of Cash Election_ _._ In the event that
the aggregate number of Company Shares in respect of which Cash Elections
have been made (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Cash
Election Number, all Company Shares in respect of which Stock Elections have
been made, or deemed by Parent in its reasonable discretion to have been
made, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ (the " _Stock Election Shares_ ")
shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration, and all Cash
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration or Cash Consideration in the following manner:

 

(A) the Cash Election Shares held by each record holder of Company Shares
shall be deemed converted to Stock Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis based
on the ratio of (x) one _minus_ (y) the Cash Election Number _divided by_ the
aggregate number of Cash Election Shares, such that the aggregate number of
Cash Election Shares so deemed converted, when added to the other Stock
Election Shares, shall equal as closely as practicable the Stock Election
Number (rounding the number of Cash Election Shares of a holder that are to
remain Cash Election Shares downward where needed), and all such Cash
Election Shares so deemed converted (" _Deemed Converted Cash Election Shares_
") shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration (and cash
in lieu of fractional Parent Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_). For
example, and by way of illustration only, if the aggregate number of Company
Shares in respect of which Cash Elections had been made were three times the
Cash Election Number, each record holder of Company Shares holding Cash
Election Shares would receive, in respect of the Company Shares for which such
holder had made a Cash Election, Cash Consideration for approximately one-
third of such Company Shares and Stock Consideration for approximately two-
thirds of such Company Shares; and

 

(B) any remaining Cash Election Shares held by each record holder of Company
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration.

 



7  For the avoidance of doubt, in the circumstances where this _Section_ __ _
4.2(b)(v)_ is applicable, each record holder of Cash Election Shares shall to
the extent reasonably possible receive the same proportion of Cash
Consideration, and the same proportion of Stock Consideration, with respect to
their aggregate Cash Election Shares as each other record holder of Cash
Election Shares receives in respect of their aggregate Cash Election Shares
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(vi)_.

(vi) _Proration for Oversubscription of Stock Election_ _._ In the event that
the aggregate number of Company Shares in respect of which Stock Elections
have been made exceeds the Stock Election Number, all Company Shares in
respect of which Cash Elections have been made pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 4.2_ shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration, and
all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock
Consideration or Cash Consideration in the following manner:

(A) the Stock Election Shares held by each record holder of Company Shares
shall be deemed converted to Cash Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis based
on the ratio of (x) one _minus_ (y) the Stock Election Number _divided by_ the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares, such that the aggregate number of
Stock Election Shares so deemed converted, when added to the other Cash
Election Shares, shall equal as closely as practicable the Cash Election
Number (rounding the number of Stock Election Shares of a holder that are to
remain Stock Election Shares downward where needed), and all such Stock
Election Shares so deemed converted (" _Deemed Converted Stock Election
Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration;
and

 

(B) any remaining Stock Election Shares held by each record holder of Company
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration.

For the avoidance of doubt, in the circumstances where this  _Section_ __ _
4.2(b)(vi)_ is applicable, each record holder of Stock Election Shares shall
to the extent reasonably possible receive the same proportion of Stock
Consideration, and the same proportion of Cash Consideration, with respect to
their aggregate Stock Election Shares as each other record holder of Stock
Election Shares receives in respect of their aggregate Stock Election Shares
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)(vi)_.

 

(vii) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent, shall make all
computations to give effect to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.2_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares; Voting_.
All Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the First Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Shares, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all Stock
Consideration issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Parent Shares shall be paid to any holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate or untransferred Book Entry Company Share until
such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) or Book Entry Company Share is transferred for
exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ IV_. Subject to the effect of
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) or
transfer of such Book Entry Company Share that has been converted into the
right to receive the Stock

 



8  Consideration, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Shares (or as applicable, Book Entry
Parent Shares) issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender or transfer, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole Parent Shares and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer, as applicable. No holder of Certificates
or Book Entry Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive Cash Consideration shall be entitled to receive any amount pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(c)_ in respect of such Certificates or Book Entry
Company Shares.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Company Share is presented to
the Surviving Corporation (which, following the consummation of the Second
Merger, shall include the Surviving Company), Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration (and to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_ and/or any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(c)_) to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ IV_.

(e) _Fractional Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no fractional Parent Shares will be issued and any holder of
Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share but for this
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_ shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu
thereof, without interest, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange
Agent and shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the average of the
closing prices per Parent Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_
"), as reported in the Wall Street Journal (or if not reported thereby, as
reported in another authoritative source), for the five full trading days
ending on the second Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time occurs _ multiplied by_ (ii) the fraction of a Parent Share
(after taking into account all Company Shares held by such holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. No such
holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in
respect of any fractional Parent Shares. No holder of Certificates or Book
Entry Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive Cash
Consideration shall be entitled to receive any amount pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_ in respect of such Certificates or Book Entry Company
Shares.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any
Parent Shares) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for
180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of
Company Shares (other than Excluded Company Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article_ __ _ IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent
for delivery of any Per Share Merger Consideration (and to the extent
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
4.2(e)_ and/or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.2(c)_), payable and/or issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_ upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) or
transfer of Book Entry Company Shares, in each case, without any interest

 



9  thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company,
Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Company Shares immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall,
to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any of Parents Subsidiaries with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, and (to
the extent applicable) any cash pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_ or unpaid
dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(c)_, that
would have been payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 

(h) _Withholdings_. Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any former holder of Company Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, or the making of such payment
under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law and
further shall be entitled to make any required reporting regarding such
payment to the appropriate taxing authority. Any amount deducted or
withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_, and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, shall be treated as having been paid or issued,
as applicable, to the holder of Company Shares in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made. Such withholding shall be made first from
the cash otherwise payable to such holder prior to withholding from Parent
Shares. In the case of any withholding from Parent Shares, Parent shall
withhold an amount of Parent Shares having a fair market value equal to the
withholding obligation to be satisfied with such Parent Shares at the time
such shares are withheld.

 

4.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Company Shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, but rather the holders of Appraisal
Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair
value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Appraisal Shares, then
the right of such holder to seek appraisal of such Company Shares shall cease
and such Company Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_,
without interest. The 

 



10  Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, and Parent shall participate in
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

outstanding Company Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Company Shares or the issued and outstanding Parent Share or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Parent Shares,
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Per Share
Merger Consideration and the Cash Election Number shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change and as so adjusted
shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger
Consideration; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any of the foregoing actions with
respect to its securities to the extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

Agreement and the Voting Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only
to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Company Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting duly
called and held for such purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "). The
Requisite Company Vote is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of
the Company that is necessary under applicable Law, NYSE rules, and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws to adopt, approve 

 



16  and authorize this Agreement. This Agreement and the Voting Agreement have
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitute valid and
binding agreements of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously approved this
Agreement and declared advisable and in the best interest of its stockholders,
the First Merger and resolved to recommend the adoption of this Agreement to
the holders of Company Shares (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B)
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Company Shares for
their adoption and (C) received the opinion of its financial advisor, Goldman
Sachs and Co. LLC, to the effect that the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Company Shares (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) is fair, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the assumptions, limitations,
qualifications and other matters set forth therein, to such holders. A signed
copy of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC rendered to the board
of directors of the Company will promptly be delivered to Parent, solely for
informational purposes, following receipt thereof by the Company. It is
understood and agreed that such opinion is for the benefit of the Companys
board of directors and may not be relied upon by Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2 or any other Person. The board of directors of the Company has
taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested stockholder" or
prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business combination" with
the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section 203 of the DGCL) as
a result of the execution of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby or thereby.

effect of monopolization, lessening of competition or restraint of trade
(together with the HSR Act, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "), the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, (C) required to be made with the NYSE, (D) under state
securities, takeover and "blue sky" Laws, and (E) (if any) required to be made

the Voting Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or in connection with
the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, except those that the failure to make or obtain
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Voting Agreement.

 



17 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the First
Merger, the Second Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a
default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or
the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,

binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, (2) assuming (solely
with respect to performance of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and
consummation of the First Merger) compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(d)(i)_, any Law to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any
party under any Contract binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, in the case of _clause_ __ _ (B)_ or _(C)_ above, for any such
breach, conflict, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration,
loss or change that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) The Company has filed or
furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all forms, statements,
certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
December 31, 2015 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports
and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or
furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments
thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). The MLP has filed or furnished, as
applicable, on a timely basis all forms, statements, certifications, reports
and documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant
to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since the Applicable Date (the
forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since the
Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of
this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _MLP Reports_ ").
Each of the Company Reports and MLP Reports, at the time of its filing or

or furnished comply, in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports or MLP Reports, as
applicable. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports and the
MLP Reports did not, and none of the Company Reports and the MLP Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement
will when so filed or furnished, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company and the MLP is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 



18 (ii) Each of the Company and the MLP maintains disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company or the MLP, as
applicable, is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys or the MLPs, as applicable,
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company and
the MLP each maintain internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
and meeting the requirements of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective
in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Each of the Company and the MLP has disclosed, based
on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to its auditors and
the audit committee of its board of directors (1) any significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys or the MLPs, as

information and has identified for the Companys or the MLPs, as applicable,
auditors and audit committee of its board of directors any material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys or the MLPs internal control over
financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent as of the date
hereof (x) a summary of any such disclosure with respect to _clauses (1)_ and
_(2)_ of the preceding sentence made by management to the Companys auditors
and audit committee since December 31, 2016 and (y) any material communication

reference into the Company Reports or the MLP Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case
of Company Reports and MLP Reports filed after the date of this Agreement,
will fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or, in the case of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the MLP Reports, of the MLP and its consolidated Subsidiaries) as of its date
and each of the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports (or, in the case of the consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows included
in or incorporated by reference into the MLP Reports, of the MLP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries), including any related notes and schedules, fairly
presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Company Reports and MLP
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all
material respects, the results of operations, cash flows, retained earnings

consolidated Subsidiaries) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments
that will not be material in amount or effect), in each case in accordance

applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

Material Adverse Effect.

(the forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished since the
Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Parent Reports_ "). MPLX
has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis all forms,
statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act since the Applicable Date (the forms, statements, reports and documents
filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto,
the " _MPLX Reports_ "). Each of the Parent Reports and the MPLX Reports, at
the time of its filing or being furnished complied, or if not yet filed or
furnished, will when so filed or furnished, comply in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Parent Reports or the MPLX Reports, as applicable. As of
their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as
of the date of such amendment), the Parent Reports and the MPLX Reports did
not, and none of the Parent Reports and the MPLX Reports filed with or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will when so
filed or furnished, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Each of Parent and MPLX is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of the NYSE.

(ii) Each of Parent and MPLX maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent or MPLX, as applicable, is
recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of Parents or MPLXs, as applicable, filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. Parent and MPLX each maintain internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in and meeting the requirements
of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Each
of Parent and MPLX has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of
this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of its board of
directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents or MPLXs, as applicable, ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for
Parents or MPLXs, as applicable, auditors and audit committee of its board
of directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting and (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role

 



35  in Parents or MPLXs internal control over financial reporting. Parent has
made available to the Company as of the date hereof a summary of any such
disclosure with respect to  _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ of the preceding
sentence made by management to the Parents auditors and audit committee since
December 31, 2016 and (3) any material communication since December 31, 2016
made by management or Parents auditors to the audit committee required or

reference into the Parent Reports or the MPLX Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case
of the Parent Reports and the MPLX Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or, in the
case of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the MPLX Reports, of MPLX and its consolidated Subsidiaries),
as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the MPLX Reports, of MPLX and its consolidated
Subsidiaries) included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
Reports and the MPLX Reports including any related notes and schedules, fairly
presents in all material respects, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed
after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present in all material
respects, the results of operations, cash flows, retained earnings (loss) and
changes in financial position, as the case may be, of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (or as applicable, MPLX and its consolidated
Subsidiaries) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_. There are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, to the Knowledge of Parent,

or liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that

directors determines in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal (in
the case of the Companys board of directors) or Parent Acquisition Proposal

reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal, respectively, terminate such negotiations, discussion

Company Recommendation Change, Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)(ii)_, and, in the case of an

terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(ii)_.

(f) _Match Rights_. The board of directors of the Company, on the one hand,
and the board of directors of Parent, on the other hand, shall not take any
action set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ unless it has first:

 

(i) caused the Company (in the case of the Companys board of directors) or

Proposal, (C) identify the Person making such Company Superior Proposal or

agreements intended to be entered into in connection with such Company

extent the other Party so wishes to negotiate, during such four Business Day
period following delivery of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice

terms of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement that the other Party wishes
to propose in response to such Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior
Proposal; and

 



51 (iii) following the end of the Notice Period, determined in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that
such Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal,
respectively, after taking into account any changes to which the other Party
has committed in writing to make to this Agreement and the Voting Agreement,
and that the failure to take an action set forth in _clause_ __ _ (x)_ or
_clause (y)_ of  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, during
the Notice Period, any revisions are made to the financial or other material
terms of the Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal that is
the subject of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the notifying Party shall

providing copies of the most recent draft of any agreements implementing such
revisions) and shall comply with the requirements of _clause_ __ _ (i)_ and

Business Day Notice Period shall instead be a three Business Day Notice
Period).

(g) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
notify the other promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt
by such Party (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition
Proposal (in the case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of Parent), or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (in the case of the
Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent), or any
request for information relating to such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case by any Person that is reasonably
likely to be considering or seeking to make, or has made within the 12 months
preceding the date of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of the Company) or Parent Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Parent),
which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, offer or request, copies of any material written communications and

proposal, offer or request, and thereafter the notifying Party shall keep the
other Party reasonably informed, on a timely basis, of the status and
material terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any discussions or negotiations with such Person
or its Representatives (without prejudice to the restrictions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ and the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_)
and provide copies of all material written communications and draft
documentation received relating to such Company Acquisition Proposal or Parent
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(h) _Intervening Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_
__ _ 6.2(c)_, the board of directors of the Company, on the one hand, and

the Requisite Company Vote (in the case of the Company) or the Requisite
Parent Vote (in the case of Parent) effect an Adverse Company Recommendation
Change or Adverse Parent Recommendation Change, respectively, if (i) a Company
Intervening Event (in the case of the Company) or Parent Intervening Event (in
the case 

 



52  of Parent) occurs and (ii) the board of directors of the Company (in the
case of a Company Intervening Event) or Parent (in the case of a Parent
Intervening Event) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to effect an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or an
Adverse Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) in response to
such Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law; _provided_ that the
board of directors of the Party in respect of which such Company Intervening
Event (in the case of the Company) or Parent Intervening Event (in the case
of Parent) has first (x) caused such Party to provide the other Party at least
four Business Days prior written notice of its intent to effect such an
Adverse Company Recommendation Change or Adverse Parent Recommendation
Change, which shall specify in reasonable detail the circumstances related to
such determination, (y) caused such Party and its Representatives to
negotiate, to the extent the other Party so wishes to negotiate, during such

the other Party concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that
the other Party wishes to propose in response to such Company Intervening
Event or Parent Intervening Event and (z) after complying with _clause_ __ _
(x)_ and _clause_ __ _ (y)_, determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to
effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company)
or Adverse Parent Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent) in response to
such Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event continues to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law after taking into
account any changes committed in writing to be made to this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement by the other Party.

efforts to have the Prospectus/Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and Parent shall use its reasonable best

their respective Prospectus/Proxy Statement to their respective stockholders.
Each of the Parties shall promptly furnish to the other all non-privileged

Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 shall promptly correct any
information provided by it or any of its Representatives for use in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement if and to the
extent that such information is discovered by Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or
Merger Sub 2, as applicable, to be or to have become false or misleading in
any material respect. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of
any written comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments

Statement received by such Party from the SEC, including any request from
the SEC for amendments or supplements thereto, and shall provide the other

with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other
Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and consider in good faith the comments of the other Party in connection with
any such document or response. None of the Company, Parent or their
respective Representatives shall agree to participate in any material or
substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with the SEC, or
any member of the staff thereof, in respect of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
or the S-4 Registration Statement unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by the SEC, allows the other Party
to participate. Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of
notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the S-4 Registration
Statement, and the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of Parent Shares for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated.

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders and at the times of the meeting of stockholders of each of
the Company and Parent to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the S-4 Registration Statement
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(c) If at any time prior to the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite
Parent Vote, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement,
so that either of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of each
of the Company and Parent.

 



54 (d) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the other

6.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon
as practicable, including preparing 

 



56  and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including filing a Notice
and Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in this Agreement,
including this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, will (and "reasonable best efforts" will
in no event) require, or be construed to require, Parent to agree to or take
any action (or consent to the Company or any Company Subsidiary agreeing
to take, or taking, any action) that would constitute a Burdensome Condition.
For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Burdensome Condition_ " means any terms,
conditions, liabilities, obligations or commitments that would obligate or
require Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to (A)
agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber or hold separate, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or (B) agree to any material changes (including
through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of
Parents or the Companys ability to own or operate, any assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, if doing so cause Parent
or the Company to take, or cause to be taken, or commit to take, or commit to
cause to be taken, any such action that relates to assets, businesses or
product lines of the Company or of Parent representing, in the aggregate,
Revenue in excess of $100,000,000. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
take or agree to any of the actions set forth in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ or
_clause_ __ _ (B)_ of the definition of "Burdensome Condition" without the
prior written consent of Parent which, without limiting Parents obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, may be granted or withheld in Parents
sole discretion. To the extent Parent so requests in writing (and solely to
the extent of such written request), the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to proffer, consent and/or agree to any of the matters referred
to in _clause_ __ _ (A)_ or _clause_ __ _ (B)_ of the definition of
"Burdensome Condition" to the extent such proffer, consent or agreement is
conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement
shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to
defend litigation or any similar proceeding if the United States Department
of Justice or the United States Federal Trade Commission authorizes its staff
to seek a preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation
of the Merger. If Parent determines to defend any litigation or similar
proceeding brought by the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice or any state attorney general in connection with
their review (if any) of the Merger, Parent will promptly reimburse
the Company for any reasonable and documented expenses and costs (including
out-of-pocket auditors and attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the Companys or its Subsidiaries or Representatives
involvement therewith The Company and Parent will each request early
termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR
Act. The Company shall, at the request of Parent, on a one time basis, (i)
agree to extend the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR
Act for up to a further 30 days and/or (ii) pull and promptly refile the
Notice and Report Forms filed in respect of the Merger. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with their
obligations hereunder, it being understood that Parent shall have the right
to lead such matters; _provided_ that each Party shall permit the other
Parties to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each of Parent and
the

 



57  Company will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed substantive communication to any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the
Parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(b) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by
the other, use reasonable best efforts to furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4
Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the limitations set forth in the provisos to _Section_ __ _
6.7_ shall apply to the Companys and Parents obligations, _mutatis
mutandis_. In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide the information concerning it necessary to
enable the Company and Parent to prepare required pro forma financial
statements and related footnotes in connection with the preparation of the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement.

 

(c) _Status_.

 

(i) Subject to applicable Law and as required by any Governmental Entity, the
Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of written
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity
with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent each shall give
prompt notice to the other of any change, fact or condition of which it
becomes aware that would be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, respectively, or any
breach by such Party of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder that would reasonably be expected to result in the
failure of any condition to the other Partys obligations to effect the Merger
hereunder. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, neither the Company nor Parent
shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ or  _Section_
__ _ 6.5(c)(i)_, the Company and Parent shall each promptly advise the other
Party if it obtains knowledge of (A) any written notice or other written
communication from any counterparty to a Contract with regard to any action,
consent, approval or waiver that is required to be taken or obtained with
respect to such Contract in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(and provide a copy thereof) or (B) any written notice or other
written communication from any other

 



58  Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger (and provide a copy thereof). The Company shall
notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any written notice or other
written communication received after the date of this Agreement from any party
to any Material Contract to the effect that such Party has terminated or
intends to terminate or otherwise materially adversely modify
its relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Partys failure to comply with this _Section_
__ _ 6.5(c)(ii)_ ( _provided_ that such failure was not in bad faith) shall
not constitute a failure of any condition set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_
to be satisfied, or otherwise provide any other Party the right not to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that
any other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

6.6 _Taxation_.

 

(a) The Parties intend to adopt this Agreement and the Merger as a plan of
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter to the contrary, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) not take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) cooperate with one another in obtaining
the opinion from the Opinion Issuer described in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_.
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to execute
and deliver to the counsel of Parent and the Company officers certificates
containing appropriate representations at such time or times as may be
reasonably requested by such counsel (each, a " _Tax Representation Letter_ ")
in connection with the delivery of the opinion described in  _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_ (in each case, only to the extent that Parent or Company, as the case
may be, in good faith reasonably believes that it is able to make such
representations truthfully).

 

(b) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with respect to Tax matters
relevant to integrating their respective Subsidiaries and operations.

6.7 _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent and
Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees,
properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such period, shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent (a) for each month
following the date hereof and the Closing, internally generated unaudited
monthly financial statements (in the form typically provided to the Companys
management), including cash flow statements and (b) all information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested,
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) to permit any
intrusive environmental sampling on any of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) to disclose any

 



59  privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ to the contrary, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents of third
parties that are necessary to permit such access or make such disclosure and
shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to permit such access or
disclosure, including pursuant to the use of "clean team" arrangements
pursuant to which certain Representatives of Parent could be provided access
to any such information. All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall be directed to the general counsel or other Person
designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.8 _Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies
of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Shares
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than 10 calendar days after the Closing Date.

 

6.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release, and thereafter, unless an Adverse Company Recommendation
Change or an Adverse Parent Recommendation Change shall have occurred, and
except with respect to press releases and other public statements in
connection with _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (to the extent expressly permitted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_), the Company and Parent each shall consult
with the other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may
be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service
or by the request of any Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, without prior consultation, each Party (a) may, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, communicate information that is not confidential
information of any other Party with financial analysts, investors and media
representatives in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent
with its past practice in compliance with applicable Law and (b) may
disseminate information included in a press release or other document already
approved for external distribution by the other Parties.

6.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), the Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation (or the
Surviving Company) to, provide to each employee who is employed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") for
so long as such Company Employee remains an employee of the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving Company) during the Continuation
Period, (i) base salary or regular hourly wage and a target annual cash bonus
opportunity that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the base
salary or regular hourly wage and target annual cash bonus opportunity
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such

 



60  Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) severance,
retirement and welfare benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to those
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
requirements of this sentence shall not apply to Company Employees who are
covered by a Company Labor Agreement.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, benefit entitlement
and level of benefits under the Parent Benefit Plans providing benefits to
any Company Employees after the Effective Time as required pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee will be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to the extent such service was
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under any similar Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent
such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, to the
extent such Company Employee is eligible to participate in a New Plan pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts (including by
directing its third party insurance providers or third party administrators)
to waive any waiting time in any and all New Plans of the same type as any
Company Benefit Plans in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans
of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company Employee to be given credit, under
the applicable New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits, for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during the year
in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Old Plan during the
same period for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the New Plan.

 

(c) Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Mergers shall be a
"change in control" for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans and shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or Surviving Company) to, honor all
employee benefit obligations to current and former employees under the Company
Benefit Plans, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Benefit
Plans set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
in accordance with their terms.

 

(d) If requested in writing by the Parent at least ten Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company will take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary to terminate, effective no later than the Business Day immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company
401(k) Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the Business Day
immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 



61  Parent shall permit each eligible Company Employee to become a participant
in an "eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ")
and make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all participant
loans) in cash or notes in an amount equal to the eligible rollover
distribution portion of the account balance distributed to each such Company
Employee from such plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, will (i) confer upon any
Company Employee or any other Person any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving Company) or any
Affiliate of Parent, or will interfere with or restrict in any way the rights
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving Company) or any
Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee or any Person at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, (ii) constitute
an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or
compensation plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates, (iii) obligate Parent,
the Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving Company) or any Affiliate of
Parent to maintain any particular compensation or benefit plan, program
arrangement, policy or contract, or (iv) prevent Parent, the Company, or any
of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans in
accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ will create any third
party beneficiary rights in any current or former service provider of the

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was previously serving as a
director or officer, MLP employee or fiduciary of any other Person or any
benefit plan of the Company or any benefit plan of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of

all interest, assessments and other charges) or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company would have been
permitted under Delaware law and under its certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or other governing documents in effect on the date of this Agreement
to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also
advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and

indemnification hereunder or thereunder).

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _paragraph_
__ _ (a)_ of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the

party.

 

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of

intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the
date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their
respective obligations under any indemnification agreement with any

carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable in any
material respect to the Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
in no event shall the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in
excess of the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.13(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage no less favorable
in any material respect to the Indemnified Parties than that provided in
the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid

premium of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made

all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.13_.

(f) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.
