omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the DGCL or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the
DGCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so
amended. Any repeal or modification of this paragraph shall not adversely affect any right of protection of a director of the corporation existing hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to or at the time of such repeal or
