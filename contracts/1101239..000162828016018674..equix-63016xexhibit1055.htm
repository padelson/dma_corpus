|

Notwithstanding clause 9.6, once the Purchasers have released and discharged
Other Retained Group Guarantees guaranteeing a sum in aggregate in excess of
£500,000 the covenant in clause 9.6 shall cease to apply and the Purchasers,
Sellers and AMS04 SPV Seller shall, acting reasonably, co-operate with each
other in good faith to procure the absolute and unconditional release and

liability of the Sellers or the AMS04 SPV Seller (or other relevant member of
the Retained Group) under such Specified Retained Group Guarantee, without the
prior written consent of the relevant Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the
case may be).

fully released from any and all obligations thereunder (the "Frankfurt Lease
Amendment Documentation"); and 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

procure the entry into of any letter of credit, guarantee, indemnity, security
obligation or other assurance against loss (including any undertaking or
commitment to provide any such letter of credit, guarantee, indemnity,
security obligation or assurance) that, in each case, may be lawfully required
or requested by the landlord under the Frankfurt Lease (with respect to
release of obligations only) or the Sellers\' Guarantor in connection with the

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

The Purchasers' Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
each Seller and the AMS04 SPV Seller the full, due and punctual performance by
each Purchaser and by each member of the Purchasers' Group of their respective
obligations under: 

 

 
--- 
| | 

| 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

in the case of any Purchaser, this Agreement and any other Share Purchase
Document to which that Purchaser is a party; and 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

in the case of any member of the Purchasers' Group, the London Business
Transfer Agreement, the Amsterdam Deed of Demerger and the Frankfurt Demerger
Agreement. 

The guarantee under this clause shall not be released or diminished by any
variation of the terms of any Share Purchase Document, the London Business
Transfer Agreement, the Amsterdam Deed of Demerger or the Frankfurt Demerger
Agreement (whether or not such variation is agreed to by the Purchasers'
Guarantor) or by any forbearance, neglect or delay in seeking performance of
the obligations hereby imposed or any granting of time for such performance or
the insolvency (or similar proceedings) of any Purchaser or member of the
Purchasers' Group or any illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any
obligation of any person under any Share Purchase Document, the London
Business Transfer Agreement, the Amsterdam Deed of Demerger or the Frankfurt
Demerger Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

If and whenever any Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers' Group (or any
of their respective successors and assigns) defaults for any reason whatsoever
in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any of the
other Share Purchase Documents, the London Business Transfer Agreement, the
Amsterdam Deed of Demerger or the Frankfurt Demerger Agreement, as the case
may be, the Purchasers' Guarantor shall forthwith upon demand: 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

whenever any Purchaser or member of the Purchasers' Group does not pay any
amount when due under or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other
Share Purchase Documents, the London Business Transfer Agreement, the
Amsterdam Deed of Demerger or the Frankfurt Demerger Agreement, immediately
pay that amount as if it were the principal obligor; and 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

unconditionally perform (or procure the performance of) such obligation and
satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the obligation, commitment or undertaking
in regard to which such default has been made in the manner prescribed by this
Agreement, any of the other Share Purchase Documents, the London Business
Transfer Agreement, the Amsterdam Deed of Demerger or the Frankfurt Demerger
Agreement, 

so that the same benefits shall be conferred on the Sellers and the AMS04 SPV
Seller as would have been received if such obligation, commitment or
undertaking had been duly performed by such Purchaser or member of the
Purchasers' Group (as the case may be).

| 
---|--- 

10.3

|

The Purchasers' Guarantor undertakes that if any amount guaranteed pursuant to
clause 10.1 is not recoverable on the basis of a guarantee for any reason it
will (as a separate and independent obligation) pay to the relevant Seller on
demand an amount equal to the amount it would have been liable to pay but for
such irrecoverability, together with an amount equal to any Losses and Tax
suffered or incurred by the relevant Seller as a result of such
irrecoverability. 

| 
---|--- 

10.4

|

This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and accordingly is to remain in
force until all of each of the Purchaser's and any member of the Purchasers'
Group's obligations under this Agreement and all of the Share Purchase
Documents, the London Business

| | 

| 

Transfer Agreement, the Amsterdam Deed of Demerger and the Frankfurt Demerger
Agreement shall have been performed notwithstanding the winding up,

Purchasers' Group (or any of their respective successors and assigns) or any
change in the status, control or ownership of any Purchaser or member of the
Purchasers' Group (or any of their respective successors and assigns). This
guarantee is in addition to and not substitution for any rights or security
which the Sellers or the AMS04 SPV Seller may have or hold for the performance
of each Purchaser's or any other member of the Purchasers' Group's obligations
pursuant to the Share Purchase Documents, the London Business Transfer
Agreement, the Amsterdam Deed of Demerger and the Frankfurt Demerger
Agreement.

result of any occupational lease agreement not having been validly transferred
to London DivestCo prior to the Completion Date; or (ii) the relevant Seller
is itself in breach of its obligations in relation to such contract under this
clause 12); or (ii) to the extent such Outstanding Transferring Contract does

warranties and undertakings) shall be read and construed without prejudice to
each of the other provisions of this Schedule and clause 7. 

|

1.2

|

No Purchaser shall be entitled to claim that any fact, matter or circumstance
causes any of the Sellers' Warranties or AMS04 SPV Warranties to be breached
if and to the extent it has been fairly disclosed in or on the terms of the
Disclosure Letter or in the Data Room, save that the Purchasers shall be
entitled to claim that any Warranty in paragraph 25 of Schedule 3 (Sellers'
Warranties) has been breached or is untrue notwithstanding that any Purchaser
knew the fact of such breach as a result of the reports in sections 2.5.1.2-Z,
2.5.2.2-AE, 2.5.2.2-AF, 2.5.3.2-O, 2.5.4.2-O and 2.5.5.2-D of the Data Room.

in each case in respect of any claim or claims under any of the Sellers'
Warranties or the AMS04 SPV Warranties. 

| 
---|--- 

1.5

|

As regards the Tax Covenant, to the extent stated in this Schedule, the
provisions of this Schedule shall operate to limit the liability of the

further operate to limit the liability of the Sellers and the AMS04 SPV Seller

under the Tax Warranties. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of

Without prejudice to clause 29 (Entire agreement), save as expressly provided
in this Agreement or the other Share Purchase Documents, each Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers and the AMS04 SPV Seller do not give

projections, statements of intent or statements of honestly expressed opinion
provided to any Purchaser (however so provided) on or prior to the date of

claim in respect of any indemnities or covenants given by any Seller or the
AMS04 SPV Seller under any Share Purchase Document). 

| 
---|---

|

Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve or abrogate any Purchaser of any
common law or other duty to mitigate any loss or damage other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, in relation to any claim under the Tax Covenant.

|

Time limits for bringing claims 

 

 
--- 
| | 

| 

| 
---|--- 

3.1

|

No claim shall be brought against any Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller unless
the relevant Purchaser shall have given to such Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller
(as the case may be) written notice of such claim specifying (in reasonable
detail to the extent known) the matter which gives rise to the claim, the
nature of the claim and the amount claimed in respect thereof (including, to
the extent reasonably practicable, such Purchaser\'s good faith calculation of
the loss thereby alleged to have been suffered by it or the relevant member of
the Purchasers' Group on a without prejudice basis: 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

in respect of a claim under the Tax Warranties and the Tax Covenant, written
notice of such claim having been given in accordance with clause 8 of the Tax
Covenant on or before the fourth anniversary of the Completion Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

in respect of all other claims under the Share Purchase Documents on or before
the date falling eighteen months after the Completion Date. 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

|

The liability of the relevant Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case may
be) in respect of such claim (other than a claim under the Tax Covenant) shall
absolutely determine (if such claim has not been previously satisfied, settled
or withdrawn) and the claim shall be deemed to have been withdrawn unless
legal proceedings in respect of such claim shall have been commenced within
six months of the giving of such notice and for this purpose proceedings shall
not be deemed to have been commenced unless they shall have been properly
issued and validly served upon the relevant Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as
the case may be) except: 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

in the case of a claim based upon a liability which is contingent or otherwise
not capable of being quantified, in which case the six month period shall
commence on the date that the contingent liability becomes an actual liability
or the liability is capable of being quantified; or 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

in the case of a claim which has arisen as a result of a claim made against a
member of the Purchasers' Group (the "Underlying Claim") where any person has
taken steps to avoid, dispute, resist, comprise, defence or appeal against the
Underlying Claim in accordance with this Schedule in which case the six month
period shall commence on the date that the Underlying Claim is finally settled
or finally determined. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

No liability for contingent or non-quantifiable claims 

If any claim (other than a claim under the Tax Covenant) arises by reason of
some liability which, at the time such claim is notified to the relevant
Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case may be), is contingent only or
otherwise not capable of being quantified, then such Seller or the AMS04 SPV
Seller (as the case may be) shall not be under any obligation to make any
payment in respect of such claim unless and until such liability ceases to be
contingent or becomes capable of being quantified. So long as such claim shall
have been notified to the relevant Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case
may be) in accordance with paragraph 3, as appropriate, then the proviso set
out at paragraph 3.2(A) shall operate to govern the time limit within which
legal proceedings must be commenced in respect thereof.

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Third party claims and conduct of litigation 

Upon any Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers' Group becoming aware of
any claim, action or demand against it by a third party which is reasonably
likely to give rise to any claim under or in connection with the Share
Purchase Documents (except for a claim under the Tax Covenant or the Tax
Warranties, in which case the provisions of clause 8 of


 

--- 
| | 

| 

the Tax Covenant shall apply), such Purchaser shall and shall procure that the
relevant member of the Purchasers' Group shall:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within fifteen Business
Days of becoming aware of such claim notify the Sellers and the AMS04 SPV
Seller by written notice in accordance with paragraph 3; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

subject to the relevant Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case may be)
indemnifying the relevant Purchaser in a form reasonably satisfactory to such
Purchaser against any liability, cost, damage or expense which may be properly
incurred: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

promptly give such information and reasonable access to personnel, premises,
chattels, books, records and documents (including in electronic form) (which
the relevant Purchaser shall procure are preserved) to the relevant Seller or
the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case may be) or other relevant member of the
Retained Group and professional advisers as such Seller or the AMS04 SPV
Seller (as the case may be) may reasonably request and consult with such
Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case may be) before taking any action
in order to avoid, dispute, resist, mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or
appeal any claim in respect thereof or adjudication with respect thereto; and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

make no admission of liability, agreement, settlement or compromise with any
third party in relation to any such claim, action or demand or adjudication
without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of the relevant Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as the case may be); 

| 
---|--- 

5.2

|

The provisions of this paragraph 5 shall not apply to the Tax Covenant or any
claim under the Tax Warranties. 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

No liability if loss is otherwise compensated for 

| 
---|--- 

6.1

|

No liability shall attach to any Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller in respect of
a breach of this Agreement to the extent that the same loss has been recovered
by any Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers' Group under any other term
of this Agreement, or any other document entered into pursuant hereto,
including the Tax Covenant, and accordingly the Purchasers may only recover
once in respect of the same loss. 

| 
---|--- 

6.2

|

The Sellers and the AMS04 SPV Seller shall not be liable for any claim to the
extent that the subject of the claim has been or is made good or is otherwise
compensated for without cost or other Loss to the Purchasers or any other
member of the Purchasers' Group. 

| 
---|--- 

6.3

|

Without prejudice to any Purchaser's right to bring a claim for breach of
clauses 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9 (Sellers' and AMS04 SPV warranties and undertakings),
if any Purchaser becomes aware of any matter which could give rise to a claim
under clauses 7.7, 7.8, or 7.9 it shall notify the relevant Seller of such
matter as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of such matter.
Any failure to give such notice shall not prevent the relevant Purchaser from
bringing a claim, provided that where any Loss is suffered by the relevant
Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers' Group due to any delay in
giving such notice, the relevant Seller's liability shall not be increased by
any additional Loss suffered or incurred by any member of the Purchasers'
Group resulting from such delay. 

| 
---|--- 

6.4

|

The Sellers' and the AMS04 SPV Seller's liability (as applicable) in respect
of any claim shall be reduced by an amount equal to any loss or damage to
which the claim related which has actually been recovered under a policy of
insurance (after deducting any costs 

 

 
--- 
| | 

| 

incurred in making such recovery and any Tax incurred as a result of the
receipt of such recovery).

| 
---|--- 

6.5

|

Where any Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller has made a payment to any Purchaser
in relation to any claim and such Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers'
Group recovers (whether by insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum
which is referable to the matter giving rise to such claim, such Purchaser or
the relevant member of the Purchasers' Group shall pay to the relevant Seller
or the AMS04 SPV Seller (as applicable) as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt: 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

an amount equal to the amount recovered from the third party (net of Tax and
less any reasonable costs of recovery); or 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

if the amount referred to in paragraph (A) exceeds the amount paid by the
relevant Seller and/or the AMS04 SPV Seller to such Purchaser in respect of
the relevant claim such lesser amount as shall have been so paid by such
Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Acts and knowledge of the Purchasers 

No claim (except for a claim under the Tax Covenant or the Tax Warranties, in
which case the provisions of clause 3 of the Tax Covenant shall apply) shall
lie against any Seller or the AMS04 SPV Seller to the extent that such claim
is attributable to any voluntary act, omission, transaction, or arrangement
(other than any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement which is
either (i) contemplated by this Agreement or the other Share Purchase
Documents; or (ii) carried out pursuant to a legally binding commitment
created on or before Completion) carried out:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

before Completion by any Seller, the AMS04 SPV Seller or any member of the
Retained Group with the prior written consent, of any Purchaser or any member
of the Purchasers' Group; and 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

after Completion by any Purchaser or a member of the Purchasers' Group outside
the ordinary and usual course of business of the Target Business at Completion
and where such person had actual knowledge that such act, omission,
transaction or arrangement would or would be reasonably likely to give rise to
or increase a claim. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Completion Accounts 

No matter shall be the subject of a claim for breach of any of the Sellers'
Warranties or the AMS04 SPV Warranties (except for a claim under the Tax
Warranties in which case the provisions of clause 3 of the Tax Covenant shall
apply) to the extent that a specific allowance, provision or reserve in
respect of such matter shall have been made in the Completion Accounts or has
been included in calculating creditors in the Completion Accounts or shall
have been otherwise taken account of or reflected in the Completion Accounts.

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

Future legislation 

No liability shall arise in respect of any claim (except for a claim under the
Tax Covenant or the Tax Warranties in which case the provisions of clause 3 of
the Tax Covenant shall apply) to the extent that liability for such claim
occurs or is increased directly or indirectly as a result of the passing of,
or a change in, any law, rule, regulation, treaty, constitution, order or
administrative action having the force of law, after the date of this
Agreement.

Purchasers (on the one hand) and the Sellers (on the other hand) shall use

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

if the Purchasers and the Sellers reach agreement on the Disputed Items within

receiving the reference or such longer reasonable period as the Expert may
determine. 

|

principles etc.) of this Schedule; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

the decision of the Expert shall, in the absence of fraud or manifest error,
be final and binding on the Purchasers and the Sellers such decision shall be
accompanied by a written summary of the reasons and basis for such decision,
and the Completion Accounts shall be the Draft Completion Accounts amended as
necessary to reflect the decision of the Expert and, as amended, signed by the
Expert;

member (as applicable) shall pay to the relevant Purchaser an amount equal to
the Shortfall or, as the case may be, the relevant Purchaser shall pay to such
Seller (as applicable) an amount equal to the Excess, within five Business
Days of agreement or determination of the Completion Accounts. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Subject to paragraph (C), if the Net External Cash Balance of the AMS04 SPV or
any member of the Target Group is a negative amount, the Seller of the Shares
of such member (as applicable) shall pay to the relevant Purchaser an amount
equal thereto or, if the Net External Cash Balance of AMS04 SPV or such member
of the Target Group (as applicable) is a positive amount, the relevant
Purchaser shall pay to such Seller an amount equal thereto, within five
Business Days of agreement or determination of the Completion Accounts. Any
payment pursuant to this paragraph (B) shall be adjusted to take into account
the Estimated Net External Cash Balance in respect of AMS04 SPV or such member
of the Target Group (as relevant) applied to the Purchase Price paid at
Completion pursuant to paragraph 1 of Part B of Schedule 2 (Completion
arrangements). 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

For the avoidance of doubt, no amount shall be payable in respect of the same
matter both pursuant to this paragraph 1 and in respect of any Sellers'
Warranty, any AMS04 SPV Warranty or Purchasers' Warranty being breached or
being inaccurate or misleading, or in respect of any breach of, or under, any
other provision of this Agreement or under the other Share Purchase Documents. 

| 
---|--- 

1.7

|

Any payment made by any Seller or, as the case may be, by any Purchaser
pursuant to paragraph 1.6 or paragraph 1.9 shall take effect as an alteration
to the London DivestCo Purchase Price, the Amsterdam DivestCo Purchaser Price,
the Frankfurt DivestCo Purchase Price or the AMS04 SPV Purchase Price (as
applicable). 

| 
---|--- 

1.8

|

Within five Business Days of agreement or determination of the Inter-Company
Receivables and the Inter-Company Payables pursuant to paragraphs 1.3(A) and
1(i) or paragraph 1.5, the Sellers shall procure that, in respect of each
member of the Target Group and AMS04 SPV, any outstanding Inter-Company
Receivables of such member or AMS04 SPV (as applicable) shall be discharged
and the relevant Purchaser shall procure that any outstanding Inter-Company
Payables of such member or AMS04 SPV (as applicable) shall be discharged in
each case in accordance with paragraph 1.9. 

| 
---|--- 

1.9

|

The Sellers (as agent for the members of the Retained Group) and the
Purchasers (as agent for London DivestCo, Amsterdam DivestCo, Frankfurt
DivestCo and AMS04 SPV) shall settle the outstanding Inter-Company Receivables
and outstanding Inter-Company Payables referred to in paragraph 1.8 above by
netting such amounts against each other to produce a net sum (in each case, a
"Net Sum") and, subject to the final sentence of 

 

 
--- 
| | 

| 

this paragraph 1.9, the Sellers (if the outstanding Inter-Company Receivables
of any member of the Target Group or AMS04 SPV are greater than the
outstanding Inter-Company Payables of such member or AMS04 SPV) or the
relevant Purchaser (if the outstanding Inter-Company Payables of any member of
the Target Group or AMS04 SPV are greater than the outstanding Inter-Company
Receivables of such member or AMS04 SPV) (the "payer") shall pay that Net Sum
to the relevant Purchaser (in the case of a payment by any Seller) or to the
relevant Seller (in the case of a payment by any Purchaser) (the "payee")
against the payment by the payee to the payer of an amount equal thereto as an
adjustment to the London DivestCo Purchase Price, the Amsterdam DivestCo
Purchase Price, the Frankfurt DivestCo Purchase Price or the AMS04 SPV
Purchase Price (as applicable). Following such payments, no further amount
(save, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Ordinary Trading Payables
and Ordinary Trading Receivables) shall be considered as due, owing or payable
between any member of the Retained Group and any of London DivestCo, Amsterdam
DivestCo, Frankfurt DivestCo and AMS04 SPV (or vice versa) in respect of the
Inter-Company Payables or the Inter-Company Receivables. The Net Sum in
respect of each member of the Target Group and AMS04 SPV shall be adjusted to
take into account the Estimated Net Inter-Company Debt in respect of such
member and AMS04 SPV applied to the London DivestCo Purchase Price, the
Amsterdam DivestCo Purchase Price, the Frankfurt DivestCo Purchase Price and
the AMS04 SPV Purchase paid on Completion pursuant to paragraph 1 of Part B of
Schedule 2 (Completion arrangements).

| 
---|--- 

1.10

|

All payments to be made under this paragraph 1 shall be made in immediately
available funds in pounds sterling (where the payment relates to London
DivestCo) and euros (where the payment relates to Amsterdam DivestCo,
Frankfurt DivestCo or AMS04 SPV), in each case without any set-off,
restriction or condition and without any deduction or withholding (save only
as may be required by law) by telegraphic transfer to the account of the
relevant Purchaser or, as the case may be, the relevant Seller notified in
advance to the party making the payment by the party receiving the payment. 

| 
---|--- 

1.11

|

The Sellers and the Purchasers agree to procure that the Ordinary Trading
Payables and Ordinary Trading Receivables will be settled in accordance with
the normal terms of trading between the companies concerned. 

| 
---|--- 

1.12

|

For the purposes of paragraphs 1.6 to 1.11 of this Part A, the Amsterdam
DivestCo Purchaser shall be deemed to be the purchaser of AMS04 SPV and the
Amsterdam DivestCo Seller shall be deemed to be the seller of AMS04 SPV.

---|--- 

(J)

|

as if the matters contemplated by clause 12.1 (Transferring Contracts and

|

so that no item shall be included more than once and no minimum materiality

| 
---|--- 

(M)

|

so as to take account of any unpaid liability incurred by London DivestCo to
pay stamp duty land tax on or prior to the Completion Date and any unpaid

--- 
| | 

| 

or a person with whom the notary shares business premises have already been

The persons appearing requested the following agreement to be notarized:

Share Transfer and Assignment Agreement

Recitals

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

The Transferor is the owner of 100% of the issued share capital of
TelecityGroup Germany FRA2 GmbH, a limited liability company (GmbH)
incorporated under German law and registered in the commercial register of the

[26,000], divided into [2] shares in the nominal amount of EUR 25,000 and EUR
1,000 respectively, each owned by the Transferor ("Shares"). The notary has
inspected (by way of electronic access) the most recent list of shareholders
as available with the commercial register, which reflects the above; no
objection (Widerspruch) has been filed (zugeordnet) in respect of such list of
shareholders. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Pursuant to a share purchase agreement, dated [tbd] ("SPA") between the
Transferor and the Transferee, the Transferor has agreed to sell and the
Transferee agreed to purchase all Shares in the Company. Pursuant to the SPA
the Shares shall be transferred from the Transferor to the Transferee. A
certified copy of the Share Purchase Agreement, to which reference is made in
this Deed, is available upon the notarization of this Deed. The persons
appearing before the notary confirm that they are familiar with the contents
of the Share Purchase Agreement and waive their right to have the Share
Purchase Agreement read aloud to them. 

Now, therefore, the parties declare the following:

§ 1\. Assignment

| 
---|--- 

1.1

|

The Transferor hereby transfers and assigns with immediate legal effect to the
Transferee [2] shares in the Company with a nominal amount of EUR [26,000]
together. The Transferee hereby accepts such transfer and assignment. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2

|

The assignment provided for in this § 1 shall include all rights and
obligations pertaining to the respective shares and shall include the right to
any undistributed profits irrespective of the business year to which they
relate. 

§ 2\. Final Provisions

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

This agreement shall be exclusively governed by the substantive laws of the
Federal Re-public of Germany. 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

The courts in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, shall have jurisdiction, exclusive
to the extent legally permissible, over disputes arising regarding the
validity and interpretation of this agreement and the assignment of shares
provided for herein. 

| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

In the event that any provision of this Agreement should be, or should be
deemed to be, fully or partially invalid or unenforceable, the validity and
enforceability of the other pro-visions of this Agreement shall not be
affected thereby. The same shall apply if the Agreement contains any gaps. The
invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by and any gap shall be
filled by such appropriate provision that, to the extent legally permissible,
comes closest to the actual or assumed intent of the parties that they would
have had at the time of the signing of this agreement had they taken such
issue into account. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Where German language terms have been added in brackets to any English
language terms, the meaning of the German language terms shall prevail 

 

 
--- 
| | 

| 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Notarial costs for the recording of this notarial deed shall be [if several
transferees: jointly (gesamtschuldnerisch)] borne by the Transferee. The costs
for the filings with the commercial registers shall be borne by the Company. 

2.6 The Company holds no real estate.

| 
---|--- 

2.7

|

The notary is hereby instructed to file new lists of shareholders
(Gesellschafterlisten) of the Company with the respective commercial registers
without undue delay after receipt of written notice by the Transferor that the
purchase price had been paid and issue copies of such list of shareholders
also to the Transferee. 

§ 3\. Notarial Briefings

3.1 The notary advised the persons appearing that

| 
---|--- 

-

|

the transfer of shares can - if the transfer directly or indirectly leads to
the aggregation of 95% or more of the shares of the company in the hand of the
transferee or a company affiliated with the transferee - the transfer can be
subject to real estate transfer tax if the company owns real estate, 

| 
---|--- 

-

|

the transferee is subject to unlimited liability with regard to unpaid capital
cash contributions as well as deficits due to insufficient capital
contributions in kind by the transferor and all other shareholders, 

| 
---|--- 

-

|

a bona fide acquisition of shares is not possible if the list of shareholders
is at the time of the transfer incorrect with regard to the share for less
than three years and the incorrectness cannot be attributed to the
beneficiary; thus a bona fide acquisition of a share within the first three
years after the incorporation of a company is only possible if the
incorrectness of the list of shareholders can be imputed to the beneficiary, 

| 
---|--- 

-

|

the notary has not evaluated the fiscal effects of this agreement and he has
neither received nor accepted a corresponding assignment or instruction, 

| 
---|--- 

-

|

all agreements have to be completely and accurately recorded in notarial form,
and that any non-recorded agreements may lead to the invalidity of all
agreements. 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

|

After this transfer of shares takes effect and irrespective of potential ex
post circumstances which may lead to the invalidity of this agreement the
notary is obligated to submit a new list of shareholders to the competent
commercial register and to provide the company with a copy of this agreement
and the amended list of shareholders without undue delay. 

| 
---|--- 

3.3

|

The parties are aware that the transferee can only validly exercise his
shareholder's rights vis-a-vis the company after having been registered in the
list of shareholders registered in the commercial register. The transferor
grants to the transferee - the transferee being exempt from the restrictions
of Sec. 181 German Civil Code - the irrevocable power of attorney to exercise
without limitation all shareholder's rights in connection with the shares
transferred by today's agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

3.4

|

The notary advised the persons appearing that he is by law obligated to submit
a certified copy of this deed to the competent tax and revenue office (Sec. 20
German Fiscal Code). 

| 
---|--- 

3.5

|

The notary finally advised the persons appearing that the data of the parties
to this agreement will be stored in the notary's office for the purpose of
safekeeping. The persons appearing consented to the safekeeping. 

This notarial deed including the annexes to it was read aloud by the notary to
the persons appearing, was presented to them for inspection, was approved by
them and was personally signed by them and by the notary as follows:
