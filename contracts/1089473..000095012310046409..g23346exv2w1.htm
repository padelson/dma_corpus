that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and

that (i)&nbsp;the conditions set forth in Sections&nbsp;7.1 and 7.2 (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied, and
remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have occurred and the Parent and Merger
Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.3, (ii)&nbsp;the Debt Financing Commitments delivered to the Company

express requirements of this Agreement) such court awards the Company damages against Parent

the Company awarding it specific performance hereunder, but nonetheless the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments delivered to the Company pursuant to Section
4.6 is not funded pursuant to the terms thereof, then, in each such event, the Company, as
its sole remedy at law or in equity, may seek to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section&nbsp;8.1, and, in the event the conditions of 8.1(g) are satisfied, upon such
termination, Parent (or its designee) shall pay to the Company (or as directed by the
Company), the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
In addition, the Company agrees to cause any suit, action or proceeding still pending to be
dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger or pay
the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9.7(e), as applicable. It is further
acknowledged and agreed that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event
that, as contemplated by clause (i)&nbsp;of the first sentence of this Section&nbsp;9.7(d), such court
declines to enter a final order or judgment in favor of the Company or, as contemplated by
