               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

                     SECTION 3.01 - CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

At the  Effective  Time,  by virtue of the Merger and  without any action on the
part  of  Merger  Sub,  the  Company  or the  holders  of  any of the  following
securities:

(a)   Conversion  of  Company  Common  Stock.  Each  Share  (including   Company
      Restricted  Shares,  but other than any Shares to be canceled  pursuant to
      Section  3.01(b),  Shares  owned by any direct or  indirect  wholly  owned
      Subsidiary  and any  Dissenting  Shares)  shall be canceled and  converted
      automatically  into the  right to  receive  $30.00  in cash  (the  "Merger
      Consideration")  payable,  without interest,  to the holder of such Share,
      upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.02, of the Certificate
      that formerly evidenced such Share.

(b)   Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned  Stock. Each Share held in
      the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub,  Parent or
      any  direct  or  indirect   wholly  owned   subsidiary   of  Parent  shall
      automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
      distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(c)   Equity  Interests  of Merger Sub.  Each share of common  stock,  par value
      $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
      the Effective  Time shall be converted  into and exchanged for one validly
      issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable  share of common  stock,  par value
      $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                    SECTION 3.02 - SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

(a)   Prior to the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall (i)  appoint a bank or trust
      company  reasonably  acceptable to the Company (the "Paying  Agent"),  and
      (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
      acceptable  to the Company,  with such Paying Agent for the payment of the
      Merger  Consideration  in accordance with this Article 3. At the Effective
      Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit,
      with the Paying Agent,  for the benefit of the holders of Shares,  cash in
      an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to
      be paid  pursuant  to Section  3.01(a)  (the  "Payment  Fund").  Except as
      contemplated  by Section  3.02(d),  the Payment Fund shall not be used for
      any other purpose.  The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
      as  directed  by Parent;  provided,  that,  such  investments  shall be in
      obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency
      or instrumentality  thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
      United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
      or  better  by  Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.  or  Standard  &amp; Poor's
      Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit
      or banker's  acceptances of,  repurchase or reverse  repurchase  contracts
      with, or Eurodollar time deposits  purchased from,  commercial  banks with
      capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $1 billion
      (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
      publicly  available).  Any profit or loss resulting  from, or interest and
      other  income  produced by, such  investments  shall be for the account of
      Parent.


                                       11
<PAGE>

(b)   Payment Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
      the Paying Agent to mail to each person who was, at the Effective  Time, a
      holder of record of Shares  entitled to receive  the Merger  Consideration
      pursuant to Section 3.01(a):  (i) a letter of transmittal  (which shall be
      in customary form and shall specify that delivery  shall be effected,  and
      risk of loss and title to the  certificates  evidencing  such  Shares (the
      "Certificates")  shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
      to the  Paying  Agent)  and (ii)  instructions  for use in  effecting  the
      surrender of the  Certificates  in exchange for the Merger  Consideration.
      Upon  surrender to the Paying  Agent of a  Certificate  for  cancellation,
      together  with such  letter of  transmittal,  duly  completed  and validly
      executed  in  accordance  with the  instructions  thereto,  and such other
      documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,  the holder of
      such  Certificate  shall be entitled to receive in exchange  therefor  the
      Merger   Consideration   for  each  Share   formerly   evidenced  by  such
      Certificate,  and such Certificate shall then be canceled. In the event of
      a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not  registered  in the transfer
      records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to
      a  person  other  than  the  person  in  whose  name  the  Certificate  so
      surrendered  is registered  if the  Certificate  representing  such Shares
      shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
      the person  requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other
      Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger  Consideration  to a
      person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or established
      to the  reasonable  satisfaction  of the Surviving  Corporation  that such
      Taxes either have been paid or are not  applicable.  Until  surrendered as
      contemplated by this Section 3.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
      times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
      such  surrender  the  Merger  Consideration  to which  the  holder of such
      Certificate  is entitled  pursuant to this Article 3 No interest  shall be
      paid or will  accrue  on any  cash  payable  to  holders  of  Certificates
      pursuant to the provisions of this Article 3.

(c)   No  Further  Rights.  From  and  after  the  Effective  Time,  holders  of
      Certificates  shall  cease  to have  any  rights  as  stockholders  of the
      Company, except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

(d)   Termination  of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
      undistributed  to the holders of Shares nine  months  after the  Effective
      Time shall be delivered to Parent,  upon demand, and any holders of Shares
      who have not  theretofore  complied  with this Article 3 shall  thereafter
      look only to the Surviving  Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation
      shall  remain   liable  for,   payment  of  their  claim  for  the  Merger
      Consideration.  Any portion of the Payment  Fund  remaining  unclaimed  by
      holders of Shares as of a date that is  immediately  prior to such time as
      such  amounts  would  otherwise  escheat  to or  become  property  of  any
      Governmental  Authority  shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
      become the  property of the  Surviving  Corporation  free and clear of any
      claims or other Encumbrance of any person previously entitled thereto.

(e)   No  Liability.  None  of the  Paying  Agent,  Merger  Sub,  Parent  or the
      Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares or any other
      person for any such Shares (or  dividends  or  distributions  with respect
      thereto) or cash or other  consideration  delivered  to a public  official
      pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other Law.

(f)   Withholding  Rights.  Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving  Corporation
      and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
      otherwise  payable  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  such  amounts  as it is
      required to deduct and withhold  with  respect to such  payment  under all


                                       12
<PAGE>

      applicable  Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying
      Agent,  the  Surviving  Corporation  or Parent,  as the case may be,  such
      withheld  amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as
      having  been paid to the  holder of the  Shares in  respect  of which such
      deduction and withholding was made.

(g)   Lost  Certificates.  If any  Certificate  shall have been lost,  stolen or
      destroyed,  upon the  making of an  affidavit  of that fact by the  person
      claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
      by the  Surviving  Corporation,  the posting by such person of a bond,  in
      such  reasonable  amount  as the  Surviving  Corporation  may  direct,  as
      indemnity  against any claim that may be made  against it with  respect to
      such  Certificate,  the  Paying  Agent  shall pay in respect of such lost,
      stolen or  destroyed  Certificate  the Merger  Consideration  to which the
      holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

                       SECTION 3.03 - STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS

At the Effective  Time,  the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further  registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company.  From and after the Effective  Time,  the holders of
Shares or  Certificates  shall  cease to have any  rights  with  respect to such
Shares, or in the case of Certificates,  the Shares evidenced thereby, except as
otherwise  provided  in this  Agreement  or by  applicable  Law. On or after the
Effective Time, any  Certificates  presented to the Paying Agent,  the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled  against delivery of the
Merger  Consideration  to which the  holders  thereof are  entitled  pursuant to
Section 3.01(a).

           SECTION 3.04 - EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS; WARRANTS.

(a)   Prior to the Effective  Time, the Company shall take all necessary  action
      (which  action  shall be effective as of the  Effective  Time),  including
      using  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  the  consent  of the
      individual  award  holders  and the  adoption  of  Board  resolutions,  if
      necessary, to:

           (i)    terminate  Everlast  Worldwide  Inc.  2000  Stock  Option  and
                  Restricted Stock Plan, as amended (the "2000 Stock Plan"), the
                  2005  Non-Employee   Director  Stock  Option  Plan,  the  1995
                  Non-Employee  Director  Stock Option  Plan,  1993 Stock Option
                  Plan and any stock options  granted  outside of a formal plan,
                  in each case as  amended  through  the date of this  Agreement
                  (collectively, the "Company Stock Award Plans");

           (ii)   provide  that each  outstanding  option to purchase  shares of
                  Company Common Stock (each,  a "Company Stock Award")  granted
                  under the Company Stock Award Plans shall become fully vested,
                  to the extent not already vested,  subject to, and conditioned
                  upon, the closing of the Merger;

           (iii)  cause  any  Company  Stock  Award  that  is not  exchanged  as
                  provided  in  Section  3.04(b)  to  be  cancelled  as  of  the
                  Effective Time;

           (iv)   provide that each Share subject to vesting or other forfeiture
                  conditions  or  repurchase  by the Company  (each,  a "Company
                  Restricted Share") granted under the Company Stock Award Plans
                  shall  become  fully  vested and shall be  converted  into the
                  right to receive the Merger  Consideration  in accordance with
                  Section 3.01(a),  subject to any applicable federal, state and
                  local Tax withholding requirements.

(b)   Each holder of a Company Stock Award that is outstanding  and  unexercised
      as of the Effective  Time and has an exercise price per Share that is less
      than the per share Merger  Consideration  shall (subject to the provisions
      of this Section  3.04) be paid by the Surviving  Corporation,  in exchange
      for the  cancellation  of such  Company  Stock  Award,  an  amount in cash
      (subject to any applicable  withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i)
      the  difference  between  the  Merger  Consideration  and  the  applicable
      exercise price of such Company Stock Award,  and (ii) the aggregate number
      of shares of Company  Common Stock  issuable upon exercise of such Company
      Stock Award (the "Award Payment").  Except as otherwise expressly provided
      for in any  agreement  between  the  Company  and  any  such  holder,  the
      Surviving  Corporation  or the Paying Agent shall make the Award  Payments
      promptly  after the Effective  Time. Any such payments shall be subject to
      all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding requirements.

(c)   The Company shall  promptly  deliver to Parent (but in no event later than
      the Effective Time) true and complete copies of all documentation relating
      to or arising  from the  termination  of the Company  Stock Award Plans or
      other actions required to be taken pursuant to this Section 3.04.

(d)   The Company shall take all necessary  action to approve the disposition of
      the Company Stock Awards in connection with the transactions  contemplated
      by this  Agreement  to the extent  necessary  to exempt such  dispositions
      under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

                        SECTION 3.05 - DISSENTING SHARES

Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this  Agreement  to the  contrary and to the
extent  available  under the DGCL,  Shares held by any  stockholder  entitled to
demand and who properly  demands the appraisal for such Shares (the  "Dissenting
Shares")  pursuant to, and who complies in all respects  with, the provisions of
Section  262 of the  DGCL  ("Section  262")  shall  not be  converted  into,  or
represent the right to receive, the Merger  Consideration.  Any such stockholder
shall  instead  be  entitled  to  receive  payment  of the  fair  value  of such
stockholder's  Dissenting  Shares in accordance  with the  provisions of Section
262;  provided,  that, all Dissenting  Shares held by any  stockholder who shall
have  failed to  perfect or who  otherwise  shall  have  withdrawn  or lost such
stockholder's  rights  to  appraisal  of such  Shares  under  Section  262 shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable
for, as of the Effective  Time,  the right to receive the Merger  Consideration,
without any interest  thereon,  upon surrender in the manner provided in Section
3.02 of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. The
Company shall give Parent  prompt notice of any demands  received by the Company
for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all  negotiations  and proceedings  with respect to
such demands.  The Company shall not settle,  make any payments with respect to,
or offer to settle,  any claim with  respect to  Dissenting  Shares  without the
prior written consent of Parent.

      or licensed to do business,  and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction

      the  nature  of  its  business  makes  such   qualification  or  licensing
      necessary,  except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in
      good  standing  that could not be  reasonably  expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect. Each such jurisdiction is listed in Section 4.01(a) of the

      exercisable or  exchangeable  for  securities  having the right to vote or

      Company Disclosure Letter,  each Company Stock Award has an exercise price

(a)   The Company has all  necessary  power and authority to execute and deliver
      this Agreement,  to perform its obligations  hereunder,  and to consummate
      the  Merger  and the other  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement
      (collectively,  the  "Transactions").  The  execution and delivery of this
      Agreement  by the  Company  and the  consummation  by the  Company  of the
      Transactions  have  been  duly and  validly  authorized  by all  necessary
      corporate  action and no other  corporate  proceedings  on the part of the
      Company are necessary to authorize  this  Agreement or to  consummate  the
      Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the adoption of this
      Agreement by the holders of a majority of the  then-outstanding  shares of
      Company Common Stock (the "Requisite Stockholder Vote") and the filing and
      recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This
      Agreement  has been  duly  executed  and  delivered  by the  Company  and,
      assuming  the due  authorization,  execution  and  delivery  by Parent and
      Merger  Sub,  constitutes  a legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of the
      Company,  enforceable  against the Company in  accordance  with its terms,
      except  to the  extent  that  enforceability  thereof  may be  limited  by
      applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization or other similar laws
      affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by principles
      of equity regarding the availability of remedies.


                                       17

(b)   The Board, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote at a meeting duly
      called and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the
      "Company Board Approval"), has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and
      the  Merger are  advisable  and fair to and in the best  interests  of the
      Company and its stockholders,  (ii) approved this Agreement and the Merger
      and (iii)  recommended  that the  stockholders  of the Company  adopt this
      Agreement  and  directed  that  this  Agreement  and the  Transactions  be
      submitted for  consideration  by the Company's  stockholders in accordance
      with this  Agreement.  The  Company has  terminated  the  Original  Merger
      Agreement  and,  following  payment of the  "Termination  Fee" (as defined
      thereunder) of $3,000,000  contemplated  thereby,  neither the Company nor
      any Subsidiary has any liability, debts or other obligations to any person
      in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c)   No "fair price," moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar
      antitakeover   Law  (each,   a  "Takeover   Law")  is  applicable  to  the
      Transactions   and  the  Company  has  taken  all  action  to  exempt  the
      Transactions  from the Takeover Laws,  including  Section 203 of the DGCL,
      and  has  taken  all  action  required  to  make  this  Agreement  and the
      Transactions comply with any requirements of the organizational  documents
      of the Company and its Subsidiaries  concerning  "business  combinations",
      "fair pricing",  "voting",  "constituency  requirements"  or other similar
      provisions.  The approval of the Transactions by the Requisite Stockholder
      Vote is the only  vote of the  holders  of any  class or  series of Equity
      Interests  of the Company or any of the  Subsidiaries  necessary  to adopt
      this Agreement or approve the Transactions.

(d)   The Board has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Piper Jaffray
      &amp; Co., dated the date, or shortly prior to the date, of this Agreement, to
      the effect that, as of the date of such opinion,  the Merger Consideration
      is  fair,  from a  financial  point of view,  to the  stockholders  of the
      Company, a copy of which opinion has been delivered to Parent.

      the consummation of the Transactions will not:

                  by-laws or equivalent  organizational documents of the Company
                  or any Subsidiary;

           (ii)   assuming  that all  consents,  approvals,  authorizations  and

                  Disclosure  Letter,  (A)  require  the  consent  of any person
                  under,  (B) result in any breach or violation of or constitute
                  a default (or an event  that,  with notice or lapse of time or
                  both,  would become a default)  under,  (C) give to others any
                  right of termination,  amendment, acceleration or cancellation
                  of, result in the creation of any  Encumbrance on any asset of
                  the  Company or any  Subsidiary  under,  or (D)  obligate  the
                  Company  or any  Subsidiary,  to take any  material  action or

                  except,  with respect to clause (ii) of this Section  4.05(a),
                  for  any  such  conflicts,   violations,  breaches,  defaults,
                  obligations, or other occurrences that could not be reasonably
                  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      except for:

           (i)    applicable  requirements,  if any, of the Securities  Exchange

(a)   Each of the Company and the  Subsidiaries is in possession of all material
      Permits necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
      its  business as it is now being  conducted,  including  Permits  required
      under  Environmental Laws (the "Environmental  Permits").  Section 4.06 of

      such  conflicts,  defaults,  breaches  or  violations  that  could  not be

      violation  of  or  result  in  the  termination  or  cancellation  of  any

      not received notice from the SEC regarding any review or investigation and
      there is no ongoing review or  investigation  of the Company or any of its
      Affiliates by the SEC.

(b)   Each of the consolidated  financial statements  (including,  in each case,
      any notes and schedules  thereto)  included (or incorporated by reference)

      generally accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent
      basis throughout the periods  indicated (except as may be indicated in the
      notes thereto),  (ii) fairly present the consolidated  financial position,
      results of operations,  cash flows and changes in stockholders'  equity of
      the Company and its  consolidated  Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
      thereof  and  for the  respective  periods  indicated  therein  except  as
      otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,  to
      normal and recurring year-end  adjustments,  none of which are material in
      nature or amount) and (iii) are  consistent  with the books and records of
      the Company and the Subsidiaries,  which books and records are correct and
      complete.

(c)   Neither the Company nor any of the  Subsidiaries  has any  liability  (and
      there is no basis for any  present or future  Action  against  any of them
      giving rise to any liability), other than (i) liabilities set forth on the
      face of the  Company  Reference  Balance  Sheet  (rather  than  the  notes
      thereto),  (ii) liabilities incurred subsequent to the date of the Company
      Reference Balance Sheet, that,  individually or in the aggregate,  are not
      material to the business,  condition (financial or otherwise),  results of

      whole.

(d)   Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
      Act"), the Company has been and is in compliance in all material  respects
      with   (i)  the   current   prevailing   applicable   provisions   of  the
      Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the rules and regulations  promulgated  thereunder
      and (ii)  the  applicable  listing  and  corporate  governance  rules  and
      regulations of NASDAQ and the Company has not received any notice from the
      National  Association of Securities  Dealers or any other person regarding
      any such non-compliance.

(e)   The Company has designed and maintains  disclosure controls and procedures
      to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the  Company  and the
      Subsidiaries  is made known to the Chief  Executive  Officer and the Chief
      Financial  Officer of the Company by others within those entities.  To the


                                       20

      extent  applicable,  the Company has  disclosed,  based on its most recent
      evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement,  to the Company's auditors
      and the audit committee of the Board (i) any significant  deficiencies and
      material  weaknesses in the design or operation of internal  controls over
      financial  reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
      material respect the Company's ability to record,  process,  summarize and
      report  financial  information  and (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud,
      whether or not material,  that involves  management or other employees who
      have a significant role in the Company's  internal controls over financial
      reporting.

<PAGE>

      respect to any Plan, any trustee or fiduciaries  thereof, the Company, any
      Subsidiary,  any  ERISA  Affiliate,  any  Employee,  officer  or  director
      thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any of the Plans (other than
      immaterial  claims  for  benefits  in the  ordinary  course)  and,  to the

      or  the   Subsidiary   has  not  received  any  notice  of,  an  audit  or
      investigation by any  Governmental  Authority and no such completed audit,
      if any, has resulted in the  imposition  of any Tax or penalty;  (iv) with
      respect  to each Plan  that is  funded  mostly  or  partially  through  an
      insurance  policy,  neither  the  Company,  nor any  Subsidiary  or  ERISA

      adjustment,  loss  sharing  arrangement  or  other  actual  or  contingent
      liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring on or before
      the date of this  Agreement  or (B) is  reasonably  expected  to have such
      liability with respect to periods  through the Effective Time; (v) neither
      the Company nor any Subsidiary  has incurred and or reasonably  expects to
      incur a  material  tax or penalty  imposed by Section  4980 of the Code or

      the administration or investment of the assets of any Plan.

(h)   Except  as set  forth in  Section  4.10(h)(i)  of the  Company  Disclosure
      Letter, the consummation of the Transactions alone, or in combination with
      a termination  of any  Employee,  officer,  director,  consultant or other
      service provider or stockholder of the Company or any Subsidiary  (whether
      current,  former or retired) or any other event, will not give rise to any
      liability  under  any  Plan,   including   liability  for  severance  pay,
      unemployment  compensation,  termination pay or withdrawal  liability,  or
      accelerate  the time of  payment  or  vesting  or  increase  the amount of
      compensation  or  benefits  due  to  any  Employee,   officer,   director,
      consultant or other service  provider or stockholder of the Company or any
      Subsidiary  (whether  current,  former or  retired)  or their  dependents,
      spouses,  or beneficiaries.  Except as set forth in Section 4.10(h)(ii) of
      the  Company  Disclosure  Letter,  as of the  Effective  Time,  no amounts
      payable  under any Plan or otherwise  will (i) fail to be  deductible  for
      federal  income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code or (ii)
      result in any payment that would not be deductible under Section 162(m) of
      the Code.  No Plan or other  agreement  provides  any  Employee,  officer,
      director,  consultant  or other  service  provider or  stockholder  of the
      Company or any Subsidiary  with any amount of additional  compensation  if
      such individual is provided  amounts subject to excise or additional taxes
      imposed under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(i)   Neither the Company,  nor any  Subsidiary  or ERISA  Affiliate  maintains,
      contributes  to or in any  way  provides  for  any  benefits  of any  kind
      whatsoever (other than under Section 4980B of the Code, the Federal Social
      Security Act or a plan qualified  under Section 401(a) of the Code) to any
      current or future retiree or terminee.

(j)   None of the Company,  any Subsidiary,  any ERISA Affiliate,  any director,
      officer  or to the  Company's  knowledge,  Employee  thereof  has made any
      promises or  commitments,  whether  legally  binding or not, to create any
      additional  plan,  contract or arrangement,  or to modify or change in any
      material way any existing Plan. No event, condition or circumstance exists
      that could reasonably be expected to result in a material  increase of the
      benefits  provided under any Plan or the expense of  maintaining  any Plan
      from the level of benefits or expense  incurred for the most recent fiscal
      year ended before the Effective Time. No event,  condition or circumstance
      exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any Plan.

(k)   Any individual  who performs or performed  services for Company and who is
      not treated as an employee  for federal  income tax purposes by Company or
      any of the Subsidiaries is not an employee under applicable Law or for any
      purpose,  including,  without limitation,  for Tax withholding purposes or
      Plan purposes; Company and the Subsidiaries have no liability by reason of
      an individual who performs or performed services for Company or any of the
      Subsidiaries in any capacity being improperly  excluded from participating
      in a Plan; and each of the Employees of Company and the  Subsidiaries  has
      been properly  classified by Company and the  Subsidiaries  as "exempt" or
      "non-exempt" under applicable Law.

(l)   Neither  the  Company,  nor any  Subsidiary  or  ERISA  Affiliate  has any
      unfunded  liabilities  pursuant  to any Plan  that is not  intended  to be
      qualified  under  Section  401(a)  of the Code  and  that is an  "employee
      pension  benefit  plan"  within the  meaning of Section  3(2) of ERISA,  a
      nonqualified  deferred  compensation  plan or an excess benefit plan. Each
      Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined under
      Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and administered in good
      faith  compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance  provided
      thereunder  from the period  beginning  January 1, 2005  through  the date
      hereof  and no such Plan  which was in effect  prior to  October  2, 2004,

(f)   No  Employee  or former  Employee  of the  Company is owed or has filed an
      administrative  complaint  or  Action  alleging  the  Employee  or  former
      Employee  is owed  any  wages,  benefits  or other  compensation  for past

      complete copies of each such agreement, as amended to date. The employment
      of  each  Employee  is  terminable  at  the  will  of the  Company  or its

      benefits  exceeded  $100,000  during  the  last  year of  such  Employee's
      employment with the Company or any Subsidiary  signed a general release in

                                       27

                  contracts to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a
                  party or by which the  Company or any of the  Subsidiaries  is

      those  Encumbrances set forth in Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure

      Subsidiaries  and that are necessary  for the  continued  operation in all
      material  respects  of the  respective  businesses  of the Company and the
      Subsidiaries as such businesses are currently conducted.  To the Company's

      owned or leased by the Company and the  Subsidiaries are in good operating
      condition  without  structural  defects,  (ii) all  mechanical  and  other

      their current and contemplated  uses in all material  respects,  and (iii)

      require any special  dispensation,  variance or special  Permit  under any
      Laws. The Company has made available to Parent true,  correct and complete
      copies of (i) all deeds,  title  reports  and  surveys  for the Owned Real
      Properties  in the  Company's  possession  or control  and (ii) the Tenant
      Leases,  together with all amendments,  modifications  or supplements,  if
      any,  thereto.  The Owned Real  Properties  are not subject to any leases,
      rights of first  refusal,  options  to  purchase  or rights of  occupancy,
      except as set forth in Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(c)   The Company  and the  Subsidiaries,  as  applicable,  have,  and after the
      Effective Time,  will continue to have, a valid and enforceable  leasehold
      interest  under  each  of the  Tenant  Leases  until  the  termination  or
      expiration of such interest, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
      Permitted  Encumbrances,  and each of the Tenant  Leases is, and after the
      Effective Time, to the Company's  knowledge,  will continue to be, in full
      force and effect until the termination or expiration of such interest. The
      Company and the Subsidiaries,  as applicable, are not in default under any
      Tenant Lease, and to the Company's knowledge, no events have occurred and,
      to the Company's knowledge,  no circumstances exist that, if not remedied,
      whether  with or  without  notice or the  passage  of time or both,  would
      result in such a default.  Neither  the  Company  nor any  Subsidiary  has


                                       28
<PAGE>

      received or given any notice of any default  (after  giving  effect to any
      applicable  notice and cure  period) or event that with notice or lapse of
      time,  or both,  would  constitute a default  (after  giving effect to any
      applicable  notice and cure period) by the Company or any Subsidiary under
      any of the Tenant  Leases which event or default  remains  uncured and, to
      the Company's knowledge, no other party is in default (after giving effect
      to any  applicable  notice and cure period)  thereof,  and no party to the
      Tenant Leases has exercised any termination  rights with respect  thereto.
      Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.13(c) of the Company Disclosure
      Letter,  all  leasing,  brokerage,  finder  and  other  similar  fees  and
      commissions  that  are  due  and  payable  by  the  Company  or any of the
      Subsidiaries  with respect to the Tenant  Leases have been paid in full. A

      made available to Parent. Each of the Tenant Leases constitutes the entire
      agreement between the Company or one of the  Subsidiaries,  as applicable,
      and each other  party  thereto,  and  neither  the  Company nor any of the
      Subsidiaries  has  made  any  oral  promises  or  agreements  amending  or
      modifying the same.  Except as set forth in Section 4.13(c) of the Company
      Disclosure  Letter,  none of the Tenant Leases in which the Company or any
      of the  Subsidiaries  is a tenant  contain any rights of  recapture or any
      limitation on the use of the applicable Leased Real Property.

(d)   There are no options,  rights of first  refusal or first offer to purchase
      or contracts of sale for all or any part of the interest of the Company or
      the Subsidiaries in, to and under any Tenant Lease.

(e)   Section 4.13(e) of the Company  Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct
      and  complete  list of all of the most  recent  title  insurance  policies
      ("Existing Title Policies") in the Company's  possession or control issued

      and complete copy of each Existing Title Policy has been furnished or made
      available to Parent. Except as set forth in Section 4.13(e) of the Company
      Disclosure Letter, the Existing Title Policies in the Company's possession
      or  control  are in full force and effect and no claim has been made under
      any of the Existing Title Policies.

           (i)    none of the Owned Real Property is now damaged or injured as a
                  result of any fire, explosion, accident or other casualty that
                  is not adequately insured against under the insurance policies
                  maintained by the Company or the Subsidiaries  with respect to
                  the Owned Real Property, and

           (ii)   none of the Leased Real  Property is now damaged or injured as
                  a result of any fire,  explosion,  accident or other  casualty
                  that, to the Company's  knowledge,  is not adequately  insured
                  against under the insurance policies  maintained by the lessor
                  of the Leased Real property, and

           (iii)  all work to be  performed,  payments to be made and actions to
                  be taken by the  Company  or any of the  Subsidiaries  and any
                  subleases of either the Company or any of the  Subsidiaries on
                  or prior to the date of this  Agreement  pursuant to any Order
                  in   connection   with   a   site   plan,   approval,   zoning
                  reclassification or similar action relating to any of the Real
                  Property,  has been performed,  paid or taken, as the case may
                  be, in all material respects and, to the Company's  knowledge,
                  there is not any planned or proposed  work,  payment or action
                  that may be  required  after the date  hereof  pursuant to any
                  such Order, and

           (iv)   The current use and  operation  of the Owned Real  Property by
                  the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  does not  violate  in any
                  material respect any restrictive covenants of record affecting
                  any of such Owned Real  Property  and  neither the Company nor
                  any Subsidiary is in default of the payment of any common area
                  maintenance or similar payments or reimbursements  thereunder.
                  To the Company's  knowledge,  the current use and operation of
                  the Leased Real  Property by the Company and the  Subsidiaries
                  does not  violate  in any  material  respect  any  restrictive
                  covenants  of  record   affecting  any  of  such  Leased  Real
                  Property. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default
                  of the  payment  of any  common  area  maintenance  or similar
                  payments  or  reimbursements  owned  by  the  Company  or  any
                  Subsidiary  with  respect to the  Leased  Real  Property.  All
                  reciprocal easement contracts, conditions and restrictions and
                  similar public or private  restrictive  covenants to which any
                  of the Real Property is subject have not been violated and are
                  set forth in Section 4.13(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter;
                  provided,  however, that the representations and warranties in
                  this  sentence  with  respect to the Leased Real  Property are
                  only  to the  Company's  knowledge.  Except  as set  forth  in
                  Section  4.13(f)  of the  Company  Disclosure  Letter,  to the
                  Company's knowledge,  there exist no outstanding  requirements
                  or  recommendations  by (i) any  insurance  company  currently
                  insuring   any  Real   Property,   (ii)  any   board  of  fire
                  underwriters or other body exercising  similar  functions with
                  respect  to any Real  Property  or  (iii)  the  holder  of any
                  Encumbrance  on any Real  Property,  in each  such  case  that
                  require  or  recommend  any  repairs  or work of any  material
                  nature be performed on such Real Property.

(g)   Set forth in Section 4.13(g) of the Company  Disclosure  Letter is a true,
      correct  and  complete  list  of all  material  plans  and  specifications
      relating to the Real  Property in the  possession of the Company or any of
      the Subsidiaries. True, correct and complete copies of such material plans
      and specifications in the possession of the Company have been furnished or
      made  available  to  Parent.   To  the  Company's   knowledge,   permanent
      certificates of occupancy covering all portions of the Owned Real Property
      that are improved and occupied, permitting such improvements to be legally
      used and  occupied  in their  current  manner,  have  been  issued  by the
      appropriate Governmental Authority and have not been withdrawn, revoked or
      suspended.  True,  correct and  complete  copies of such  certificates  of
      occupancy in the  possession  of the Company  have been  furnished or made
      available to Parent. To the Company's knowledge,  there does not exist and
      there has not occurred  since the Company's  acquisition of the Owned Real
      Property any alteration,  improvement or change in the use of any building
      or other  improvement in the Owned Real Property that would  require,  the
      issuance of any new or amended  certificate  of  occupancy.  No Owned Real
      Property is and, to the Company's  knowledge,  no Leased  Property is, or,
      with respect to the Real Property,  to the Company's  knowledge,  will be,
      subject to zoning,  use or building code restrictions that would prohibit,
      and no state of facts exists with respect to the Owned Real  Property and,
      to the  Company's  knowledge,  no state of facts exist with respect to the
      Leased  Real  Property  or,  with  respect  to the Real  Property,  to the
      Company's  knowledge,   will  exist,  that  would  prevent  the  continued
      ownership,  leasing or use of such real  property  in its  business as now
      conducted and proposed to be conducted.  Without  limiting the  foregoing,
      (i) with  respect to the Owned Real  Property  there is no pending and, to
      the Company's knowledge, with respect to the Leased Real Property there is
      no  pending  or  with  respect  to the  Real  Property,  to the  Company's
      knowledge, threatened, condemnation or eminent domain Action affecting the
      Owned Real Property and/or Leased Real Property, as applicable, that would
      reasonably  be  expected  to affect  the use,  operation,  maintenance  or
      enjoyment  of  thereof  in any  material  respect,  (ii) to the  Company's


                                       30

      knowledge,  there are no plans of a  Governmental  Authority to change the
      highway or road system in the vicinity of the Real Property or to restrict
      or change  access from any such highway or road to the Real  Property that
      could adversely affect access to any roads providing a means of ingress to
      or egress from the Real  Property,  and (iii) to the Company's  knowledge,
      there is no pending or proposed  Action to change or  redefine  the zoning
      classification of all or any portion of any of the Real Property.

(h)   Except as set forth in Section 4.13(h) of the Company  Disclosure  Letter,

                      SECTION 4.15 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

(a)   Section  4.15(a)  of the  Company  Disclosure  Letter  contains a detailed
      description of all  Intellectual  Property (a) owned by the Company or any
      of the Subsidiaries (the "Company Intellectual Property") or (b) licensed,
      used or held  for use by the  Company  or any of the  Subsidiaries  in the
      conduct  of  their  businesses  ("Licensed  Intellectual  Property").  The
      Company and the Subsidiaries have (i) all right, title and interest in and
      to all Company Intellectual Property,  free and clear of all Encumbrances,
      other  than  Permitted  Encumbrances  and (ii) all  necessary  proprietary
      rights  in  and  to  all   Intellectual   Property,   including   Licensed
      Intellectual  Property,  used in, necessary for, or held for use in, their
      businesses  as now  conducted  and as proposed to be  conducted,  free and
      clear of all Encumbrances,  other than Permitted  Encumbrances.  Except as
      set forth in Section 4.15(a) of the Company Disclosure  Letter,  there are
      no outstanding  contracts or Orders  relating to the Company  Intellectual
      Property.  Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries (y) is bound by
      or a party to any  contract of any kind with  respect to the  Intellectual
      Property of any other  person,  except with respect to a license  contract
      regarding  Licensed   Intellectual   Property  or  (z)  has  received  any
      communication  alleging  that  it has  infringed  or,  by  conducting  its
      business as proposed,  would infringe the Intellectual  Property rights of
      any third person. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
      the  carrying on of the  Company's  and the  Subsidiaries'  businesses  as
      currently  conducted  or  proposed  to  be  conducted  will  infringe  the
      Intellectual  Property rights of any person;  alter, impair or require the
      consent  of any  other  person  in  respect  of any  Company  Intellectual
      Property or Licensed Intellectual Property; or conflict with, or result in
      a breach of the  terms,  conditions  or  provisions  of, or  constitute  a
      default  under,   any  contract  by  which  the  Company  or  any  of  the
      Subsidiaries  is  bound  or to  which  it is a  party.  To  the  Company's
      knowledge,  there has been, and there is no unauthorized use, infringement
      or  misappropriation  of the  Company  Intellectual  Property  or Licensed
      Intellectual Property by any third party (including licensees,  retailers,
      employees,  former  employees  and  contract  workers).  All of the rights
      within  the  Company  Intellectual   Property  and  Licensed  Intellectual
      Property are valid,  enforceable and subsisting,  and there is no claim or
      demand of any person  pertaining  to, or any Action that is pending or, to
      the Company's  knowledge,  threatened,  that  challenges the rights of the
      Company  or  its  Subsidiaries  in  respect  of any  Company  Intellectual
      Property or Licensed Intellectual Property or the validity, enforceability
      or effectiveness thereof. No person has any option with respect to Company
      Intellectual  Property. The Company Intellectual Property and the Licensed
      Intellectual  Property constitute all Intellectual  Property necessary for
      the operation of the Company's and Subsidiaries'  respective businesses as
      currently  conducted or proposed to be conducted.  Neither the Company nor
      any  Subsidiary is in default (or would with the giving of notice or lapse
      of  time be in  default)  under  any  material  license  to use any of the
      Licensed Intellectual Property.

(b)   Except as set forth on Section 4.15(b) of the Company  Disclosure  Letter,
      neither the Company nor any  Subsidiary is a party to any  contracts  with
      respect  to the  Company  Intellectual  Property.  Section  4.15(b) of the
      Company  Disclosure Letter sets forth, with respect to each such contract,

      Property may be used,  (ii) the inception date and  termination  date, and

      Disclosure Schedule,  there are no contracts relating to options to extend

      other  matters  described  in this  sentence.  The royalty fee  percentage
      specified  in each license  remains in effect,  is being paid when due and
      has not been  reduced,  modified,  waived  or  otherwise  affected  by any
      license "side letter," modification,  amendment,  waiver or suspension, in
      whole or in part. No right of rescission, counterclaim or defense has been
      asserted by a licensee  with  respect to a license.  There are no contract
      limitations  prohibiting  the  Company,  any  Subsidiary  or any of  their
      respective  Affiliates  from  operating  their  respective  businesses  or
      granting  any  licenses  in any  geographic  area or  location,  except as
      expressly set forth in the licenses.  There are no material  disputes with
      any licensees.

      and  foreign  Tax  returns  and  reports  required  to be  filed  by  them
      (collectively,  "Tax Returns"),  and all such Tax Returns were correct and
      complete in all material respects,  and (ii) paid and discharged all Taxes
      required to be paid or discharged.  The Company and the Subsidiaries  have
      paid all Taxes due whether or not shown on a Tax  Return.  The most recent

      reserve  for all Taxes  payable by the Company or any  Subsidiary  for all
      taxable  periods or portions  thereof  through the date of such  financial
      statements.  Since  the  date  of the  most  recent  financial  statements
      contained  in the SEC  Reports,  no Taxes have accrued with respect to the
      Company or any Subsidiary  other than Taxes accrued in the ordinary course
      of  business.  The  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  have  duly and  timely
      withheld all Taxes required to be withheld by them and such withheld Taxes
      have been duly and timely  paid to the proper  taxing  authority.  Section
      4.16(a)  of the  Company  Disclosure  Letter  lists all  income  and other
      material  Tax  Returns  filed with  respect to any of the  Company and the
      Subsidiaries  for taxable  periods  ended on or after  December  31, 2001,
      indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited and indicates those Tax
      Returns that currently are the subject of audit. Parent has been furnished
      by the Company with true and complete  copies of all filed federal,  state
      and local  income or  franchise  Tax  Returns  and state sales and use Tax
      Returns for or including the Company and each of the  Subsidiaries for all
      periods after December 31, 2001.

(b)   Except as described in Section 4.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter:

           (i)    no contract or other document waiving or extending the statute
                  of  limitations  or the period of  assessment or collection of
                  any Taxes has been filed or entered into by the Company or any
                  of the Subsidiaries with any taxing authority;

           (ii)   no taxing  authority  is now  asserting  or, to the  Company's
                  knowledge, threatening to assert against the Company or any of
                  the Subsidiaries any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes;

           (iii)  there  are no  pending  audits  of the  Company  or any of the
                  Subsidiaries by any taxing authority nor are there any Actions
                  currently  being  conducted with respect to any issue relating
                  to Taxes; and


                                       34
<PAGE>

           (iv)   there are no Encumbrances  for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet
                  due and payable)  upon any of the assets of the Company or any
                  Subsidiary.

(c)   Neither  the  Company  nor  any  Subsidiary  is a  party  to any  contract
      providing for the allocation or sharing of, or indemnification from, Taxes
      with  any  party  other  than  the  Company  and/or  one  or  more  of the
      Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability for
      the Taxes of another person (other than the Company and the  Subsidiaries)
      under Treasury  Regulations  ss.1.1502-6  (or similar  provision of state,
      local or foreign law), or as  transferee  or  successor,  by contract,  or
      otherwise.  There  are  no  outstanding  requests  by the  Company  or any
      Subsidiary  for any Tax ruling from any taxing  authority  and neither the
      Company nor any  Subsidiary  has (i) received a Tax ruling or (ii) entered
      into  any  closing  agreement  or  other  similar  contract  with a taxing
      authority  relating  to Taxes of the  Company or any  Subsidiary,  in each
      case,  effective with respect to a taxable period for which the statute of
      limitations is still open or a taxable period ending after the date of the
      Closing.  The  Company is not,  nor was it any time  during the  five-year
      period  ending on the date on which the Effective  Time occurs,  a "United
      States real property  holding  corporation"  within the meaning of Section
      897(c)  of the Code;  at the  Closing,  Parent  shall be  provided  with a
      certificate  of the Company to that effect that complies with the Treasury
      Regulations  under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.  The  utilization of
      the  net  operating  losses  and  tax  credits  of  the  Company  and  the
      Subsidiaries is not subject to any limitation under Section 382 or Section
      383 of the Code or the  "separate  return  limitation  year"  rules of the
      consolidated  return  regulations.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
      has  distributed  the stock of another  company in a transaction  that was
      purported  or intended to be governed by Section 355 or Section 361 of the
      Code.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has engaged in any listed or
      other reportable  transaction  within the meaning of Treasury  Regulations
      ss.1.6011-4(b).

(d)   No tax authority of a jurisdiction  in which the Company or any Subsidiary
      does not file Tax Returns has questioned whether, or asserted that, it may
      be obligated to file Tax Returns in that jurisdiction. Neither the Company
      nor any  Subsidiary is a party to any tax sharing  agreement.  Neither the
      Company nor any  Subsidiary has been or is required to make any adjustment
      pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar  provision of state,
      local or foreign tax law by reason of any change in any accounting method,
      there is no  application  pending  with any  taxing  authority  requesting
      permission for any change in any accounting method for Tax purposes and no
      taxing  authority has proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting
      method. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to include
      in the  gross  income  of a taxable  period  ending  after the date of the
      Closing  income  or gain  attributable  to cash  received,  or an  account
      receivable  that  arose,  in a  prior  taxable  period  and  that  was not
      recognized in that prior taxable  period,  as a result of the  installment
      method,  the completed contract method or the cash method of accounting or
      any other method of accounting that defers the recognition of income.  The
      Company and each of its  Subsidiaries has fully complied with all statutes
      and  regulations  relating  to the  accounting  for  and  paying  over  of
      unclaimed or abandoned funds and other property.

      constitute   such  a  breach  or  default,   or  permit   termination   or
      modification,  under any Policy. To the Company's knowledge, no insurer on
      any  Policy  has  been  declared  insolvent  or  placed  in  receivership,
      conservatorship or liquidation.

(d)   No notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to
      any Policy and there are no  historical  gaps in coverage  nor have policy
      limits been exhausted or significantly diminished.

      under the Policies with respect to events occurring prior to the Effective
      Time and the Company or the  Subsidiaries  will be entitled to the benefit
      of the Policies.

                 SECTION 7.01 - SPECIAL MEETING; PROXY STATEMENT

As promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement (but in any
event,  in the case of Section  7.01(b) within 10 business  days),  the Company,
acting through its Board, shall in accordance with applicable Law:

(a)   duly call,  give notice of,  convene and (unless this  Agreement  has been
      terminated)  hold a special  meeting  of its  stockholders  (the  "Special
      Meeting"  for the  purposes  of  considering  and taking  action  upon the
      approval and adoption of this  Agreement and the  Transactions,  including
      adjourning  such meeting for up to ten (10)  business  days to obtain such
      approval:

           (i)    use  reasonable  best  efforts to solicit the approval of this
                  Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,

           (ii)   except to the extent  that the Board shall have  withdrawn  or
                  modified its approval or  recommendation  of this Agreement as
                  permitted by Section 7.03,  include in the Proxy Statement the
                  Board's  declaration of the advisability of this Agreement and
                  its  recommendation  to the  stockholders  of the Company that
                  they adopt this  Agreement and approve the  Transactions,  and
                  shall include disclosure  regarding the approval of the Board;
                  and

           (iii)  without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  the Company
                  agrees that its  obligations  under this Section 7.01(a) shall
                  not be affected by the commencement,  public proposal,  public
                  disclosure or other  communication to the Company or any other
                  person of any Acquisition Proposal.

(b)   prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary  proxy  statement  relating to
      the Transactions and this Agreement and obtain and furnish the information
      required to be included by the SEC therein and,  after  consultation  with
      Parent, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments made
      by the SEC with  respect to the  preliminary  proxy  statement  (including
      filing as promptly as reasonably practicable any amendments or supplements
      thereto  necessary  to be filed in  response  to any such  comments  or as
      required by Law), use its reasonable  best efforts to have the SEC confirm
      that it has no further  comments and cause a definitive  proxy  statement,
      including any amendments or supplements  thereto (the "Proxy  Statement"),
      to be mailed to its  stockholders at the earliest  practicable  date after
      the date that the SEC confirms it has no further  comments,  provided that
      no amendments or  supplements  to the Proxy  Statement will be made by the
      Company without prior consultation with Parent and its counsel; and

(c)   notify Parent  promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
      staff  and of any  request  by the  SEC or its  staff  for  amendments  or
      supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional  information and will
      supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any
      of its representatives,  on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
      other hand,  with respect to the Proxy  Statement.  The Company shall give
      Parent a reasonable  opportunity to comment on any correspondence with the
      SEC or its staff or any  proposed  material  to be  included  in the Proxy
      Statement  prior to  transmission  to the SEC or its staff and shall  not,


                                       45
<PAGE>

      unless  required  by Law,  transmit  any such  material  to  which  Parent
      reasonably  objects.  If at any time prior to the  Special  Meeting  there
      shall  be  discovered  any  information  that  should  be set  forth in an
      amendment or  supplement,  after  obtaining  the consent of Parent to such
      amendment or supplement (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld
      or  delayed),  the Company  shall  promptly  transmit  such  amendment  or
      supplement to its stockholders.

              SECTION 7.02 - ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

(a)   From the date of this  Agreement to the  Effective  Time and in compliance
      with applicable  Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries
      and the officers,  directors,  employees,  auditors,  investment  bankers,

                  Property) and  environmental  and  engineering  inspections of
                  each   of  the   Company's   properties.   With   respect   to

                  consultant  to  undertake  environmental  assessments  of  the
                  Property.  The  Company  shall  provide  access  to  the  Real
                  Property for the conduct of the environmental assessments, and
                  shall provide to the  environmental  consultant  all known and
                  available   environmental   and   worker   health  and  safety
                  information  and  documentation  concerning any  environmental
                  matters pertaining to the Company,  any of the Subsidiaries or

                           SECTION 7.03 - SOLICITATION

(a)   [Intentionally omitted]

(b)   From the date of this  Agreement  until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
      the  termination of this  Agreement in accordance  with Article 9, none of
      the Company,  its Subsidiaries or any of their respective  Representatives
      shall,  directly  or  indirectly,   (i)  initiate,  solicit  or  encourage
      (including  by  way  of  providing  information)  the  submission  of  any
      inquiries,  proposals  or offers or any other  efforts  or  attempts  that
      constitute  or may  reasonably  be  expected  to lead  to any  Acquisition
      Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto
      or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any
      such inquiries,  proposals,  offers, efforts, discussions or negotiations,

      Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent,
      agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement
      or share exchange  agreement,  option agreement or other similar agreement
      providing  for or  relating to an  Acquisition  Proposal or enter into any
      agreement  or agreement  in  principle  requiring  the Company to abandon,
      terminate or fail to consummate the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or
      breach  its  obligations  hereunder  or  propose or agree to do any of the
      foregoing.

(c)(i)Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.03(b), if
      at any time  following  the date of this  Agreement and prior to obtaining
      the Requisite  Stockholder  Vote, the Company has otherwise  complied with
      its  obligations  under this  Section  7.03 and the Company has received a
      written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board believes in
      good faith to be bona fide and the Board  determines in good faith,  after
      consultation with its independent  financial advisors and outside counsel,
      that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected
      to  result  in a  Superior  Proposal,  then the  Company  may (A)  furnish
      information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
      making such  Acquisition  Proposal and (B)  participate  in discussions or
      negotiations  with the person making such Acquisition  Proposal  regarding
      such Acquisition Proposal;  provided,  that the Company (x) shall not, and
      shall not allow  Representatives  to,  disclose  any  material  non-public
      information   to  such  person   without   entering   into  an  Acceptable
      Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly provide or make available
      to Parent any material  non-public  information  concerning the Company or
      its  Subsidiaries  provided to such other person which was not  previously
      provided to Parent.

           (ii)   [Intentionally omitted]

<PAGE>

           (iii) From and after the date of this  Agreement,  the Company shall
                  promptly  (and in any event  within one  business  day) notify
                  Parent if it receives an Acquisition Proposal from a person or
                  group of related  persons  including  the  material  terms and
                  conditions  thereof and the identity of the person making such
                  Acquisition  Proposal and shall keep Parent  apprised  and, at
                  Parent's request, shall update Parent as to the status and any
                  material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning
                  such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, the
                  Company  shall  promptly (and in any event within one business
                  day) notify  Parent  orally and in writing if it determines to
                  begin furnishing information or to participate in negotiations
                  concerning an  Acquisition  Proposal from a person or group of
                  related persons pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(i)(A) or (B).

(d)   Neither the Board nor any committee  thereof shall  directly or indirectly
      (i)  withdraw  or modify in a manner  adverse to Parent or Merger  Sub, or
      publicly  propose to withdraw  or modify in a manner  adverse to Parent or
      Merger  Sub,  its  recommendation  in favor of the Merger or (ii) take any
      other action or make any other public  statement  in  connection  with the
      Company  Stockholder  Meeting   inconsistent  with  such   recommendation;
      provided,  that at any time prior to obtaining the  Requisite  Stockholder
      Vote, if the Company  receives an Acquisition  Proposal which the Board of
      Directors of the Company  concludes in good faith  constitutes  a Superior
      Proposal,  the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) cause the Company
      to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section  9.01(g) to  concurrently
      enter into a definitive  agreement with respect to such Superior  Proposal
      or  (ii)  withdraw  or  modify  its  approval  of  this  Agreement  or its
      recommendation  that the Company's  stockholders  adopt this Agreement and
      approve the  Transactions  if, in each case, the Board  determines in good
      faith, after consultation with outside counsel,  that failure to take such
      action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  provided,
      however,  that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement  pursuant to
      the  foregoing  clause (i) and any purported  termination  pursuant to the
      foregoing  clause  (i)  shall be void and of no force and  effect,  unless
      prior to such  termination  the Company pays the  Termination  Fee payable
      pursuant to Section 9.03,  the Company has complied with this Section 7.03
      and such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal;
      and provided,  further,  that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
      pursuant  to the  foregoing  clause  (i) and the  Board  may not  effect a
      withdrawal or modification  of its approval of this Agreement  pursuant to
      the foregoing  clause (ii) unless the Company  shall have  provided  prior
      written  notice to Parent,  at least four  business  days in advance  (the
      "Notice  Period"),  of its intention to withdraw or modify its approval of
      this  Agreement  or  terminate  this  Agreement to enter into a definitive
      agreement  with  respect to such  Superior  Proposal,  which  notice shall
      include a written  summary of the material  terms and  conditions  of such
      Superior  Proposal  (including  the  identity  of the  party  making  such
      Superior Proposal),  and shall have  contemporaneously  provided a copy of
      the relevant  proposed  transaction  agreements with the party making such
      Superior  Proposal  and any other  material  documents  relating  thereto.
      During  the  Notice  Period,  the  Company  shall,  and  shall  cause  its
      Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to
      the  extent  Parent  and  Merger  Sub  desire to  negotiate)  to make such
      adjustments in the terms and conditions of this  Agreement,  and the Board
      shall take into  account any changes to the  financial  and other terms of
      this  Agreement  proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice
      by the Company or otherwise,  so that the  Acquisition  Proposal ceases to
      constitute a Superior  Proposal (it being  understood  and agreed that any
      amendment to the financial  terms or other term of such Superior  Proposal
      shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new  four-business
      day period).

(e)   Nothing  contained in this  Section  7.03 or  elsewhere in this  Agreement
      shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its  stockholders
      a position  contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
      the Exchange Act; provided,  that any such disclosure (other than a "stop,
      look and listen" letter or similar  communication of the type contemplated
      by  Rule  14d-9(f)  under  the  Exchange  Act)  shall  be  deemed  to be a
      withdrawal  of the  Board's  recommendation  in  favor  of this  Agreement
      pursuant to Section 7.03(d) unless the Board expressly  publicly reaffirms
      in such  disclosure  its  recommendation  in favor of the adoption of this
      Agreement.

(f)   The  Company   acknowledges   and  agrees  that  any   violations  of  the
      restrictions set forth in this Section 7.03 by any  Representative  of the

      Section 7.03 by the Company.

(g)   The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, pay, reimburse or otherwise
      assume  liability  for, or agree or commit to pay,  reimburse or otherwise
      assume  liability  for,  any fees or  expenses of any person with whom the
      Company  holds  discussions  or to whom the Company  provides  information
      pursuant to this Section 7.03.

             SECTION 7.04 - DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION

(a)   From and  after  the  Effective  Time,  the  Surviving  Corporation  shall
      indemnify  and  hold  harmless,  to the  fullest  extent  permitted  under
      applicable Law (and the Surviving  Corporation shall also advance expenses
      as  incurred  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  under  applicable  Law;
      provided,  that the  person to whom  expenses  are  advanced  provides  an
      undertaking  to repay such  advances if it is ultimately  determined  that
      such person is not entitled to  indemnification),  each present and former
      director  and officer of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (collectively,
      the  "Indemnified   Parties")  against  any  and  all  costs  or  expenses
      (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, losses, claims,
      damages or  liabilities  incurred in connection  with any Action,  whether
      civil,  criminal,  administrative  or  investigative,  arising  out  of or
      pertaining  to any action or omission or matters  existing or occurring at
      or prior to the Effective Time,  including the  Transactions,  to the same
      extent as provided in the  certificate of  incorporation  or bylaws of the
      Company, or any other applicable contract, in effect on the date hereof.

(b)   For six years from the Effective  Time,  the Surviving  Corporation  shall
      maintain in effect for the benefit of the  directors  and  officers of the
      Company  currently  covered  by the  officers'  and  directors'  liability
      insurance policies of the Company an insurance and indemnification  policy
      with an  insurer  with a  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  rating  of at  least A that
      provides  coverage for acts or omissions  occurring prior to the Effective
      Time (the "D&amp;O Insurance") covering each such person on terms with respect
      to coverage and in amounts no less  favorable  than those of the Company's
      directors'  and officers'  insurance  policy in effect on the date of this
      Agreement;  provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
      required to pay an annual  premium for the D&amp;O Insurance in excess of 300%
      of the annual  premium  currently  paid by the Company for such  coverage;
      provided, further, that if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage
      exceed 300% of such annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
      a policy with the greatest  coverage  available  for a cost not  exceeding
      such amount.  The Surviving  Corporation may satisfy its obligations under
      this Section  7.04(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy from an insurer with a


                                       49
<PAGE>

      Standard  &amp; Poor's  rating  of at  least A under  the  Company's  existing
      directors' and officers'  insurance policy, that (i) has an effective term
      of six years from the  Effective  Time,  (ii)  covers  each  director  and
      officer  currently  covered  by the  Company's  directors'  and  officers'
      insurance  policy in effect on the date of this  Agreement for actions and
      omissions  occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains
      terms that are no less  favorable  than those of the Company's  directors'
      and officers' insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(c)   The certificate of incorporation  and bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation
      shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
      than  are set  forth  in the  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws,
      respectively,  of the Company,  unless any  modification  thereof shall be
      required  by Law and then  such  modification  shall  be made  only to the
      minimum  extent  required  by such  Law,  which  provisions  shall  not be
      amended,  repealed  or  otherwise  modified,  except as  provided  in this
      Section 7.04(c),  for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
      manner that would affect  adversely the rights  thereunder of  individuals
      who, at or prior to the Effective  Time, were directors or officers of the
      Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d)   The provisions of this Section 7.04 are intended to be for the benefit of,
      and will be enforceable by, each  Indemnified  Party, his or her heirs and
      his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution
      for, any other rights to  indemnification  or  contribution  that any such
      person may have by contract or otherwise.

(e)   Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the contrary,  if any claim,  action,
      suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
      Effective Time) is made against any  Indemnified  Party or any other party
      covered by directors' and officers'  liability  insurance,  on or prior to
      the sixth  anniversary  of the  Effective  Time,  the  provisions  of this
      Section 7.04 shall continue in effect until the final  disposition of such
      claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(f)   If the  Surviving  Corporation  or any of its  successors  or assigns  (i)
      consolidates  with or merges  into any other  person  and shall not be the
      continuing or surviving  corporation  or entity of such  consolidation  or
      merger or (ii)  transfers all or  substantially  all of its properties and
      assets to any person,  then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
      be made so that the  successors  and assigns of the Surviving  Corporation
      shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

             SECTION 7.05 - FURTHER ACTION; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS

      obtain the consent and approval of any Governmental  Authorities under any
      Applicable Non-U.S.  Antitrust Laws, and in each case, shall promptly make
      any further  filings  pursuant  thereto that may be  necessary,  proper or
      advisable. Each of the parties shall furnish to the other such information
      and assistance as the other shall  reasonably  request in connection  with
      the  preparation  of any  submissions  to, or agency  proceedings  by, any
      Governmental  Authority  under the HSR Act or any Non-U.S.  Antitrust Law,
      and each of the  parties  shall keep the other  promptly  apprised  of the
      content and status of any communications  with, and  communications  from,
      any   Governmental   Authority   with   respect  to  the  Merger  and  the
      Transactions.  The  parties  shall seek early  termination  of the waiting


                                       50
<PAGE>

      period  under  the  HSR Act  and,  to the  extent  applicable,  under  any
      Applicable  Non-U.S.  Antitrust  Law in  which a filing  has been  made in
      respect of the Merger by the parties.  Each party shall use its reasonable
      best efforts to obtain any and all clearances pursuant to the filings made
      under  the HSR Act and the  Applicable  Non-U.S.  Antitrust  Laws.  To the
      extent practicable and permitted by a Governmental  Authority,  each party
      hereto shall permit  representatives  of the other party to participate in
      meetings  (whether  by  telephone  or in  person)  with such  Governmental
      Authority.

(b)   Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
      with obtaining any approval or consent from any person with respect to the
      Merger,  (i) without the prior written  consent of Parent (which shall not
      be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  none of the Company or any of its
      Subsidiaries  shall pay or commit to pay to such person whose  approval or
      consent  is being  solicited  any cash or  other  consideration,  make any
      commitment  or incur any liability due to such person and (ii) no party or
      its  Affiliates  shall be  required to pay or commit to pay to such person
      whose   approval  or  consent  is  being   solicited  any  cash  or  other
      consideration,  make any commitment or to incur any  liability;  provided,
      however,  that  such  party  shall  give  the  other  parties  hereto  the
      opportunity to make such payments.

                       SECTION 7.06 - PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

Parent and the Company agree that no public release or  announcement  concerning
the Transactions or the Merger shall be issued by either party without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld),
except as such  release or  announcement  may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement  shall use its best efforts to allow the other party
reasonable  time to comment on such release or  announcement  in advance of such
issuance;  provided,  however,  that each of Parent and the Company may make any
public  statement  in  response to specific  questions  by the press,  analysts,
investors  or  those  attending   industry   conferences  or  financial  analyst
conference  calls,  so long as any such  statements  are not  inconsistent  with
previous  public  releases  or  announcements  made by Parent or the  Company in
compliance  with this  Section  7.06 and do not  reveal  non-public  information
regarding the other party.

(a) such party is required to retain or disclose such  information by applicable
Law or such retention or disclosure is necessary in connection  with the pursuit
or defense of a claim,  (b) such  information  was known by such party  prior to
such  disclosure  or  was  thereafter   developed  or  obtained  by  such  party
independent  of  such  disclosure  or (c)  such  information  becomes  generally
available to the public other than by breach of this Section 7.07.  Prior to any
disclosure  of  information  pursuant  to the  exception  in  clause  (a) of the

      in a failure of a  condition  set forth in  Section  8.02(a) or 8.02(b) (a
      "Terminating Company Breach");  provided, that if such Terminating Company
      Breach is  reasonably  curable  by the  Company  within 20 days  after the
      occurrence of such Terminating  Company Breach through the exercise of its
      reasonable  best  efforts  and  for as long as the  Company  continues  to

      of such 20-day period and the Outside Date;

(f)   By written notice of the Company (if the Company is not in material breach
      of its  obligations  or its  representations  and  warranties  under  this
      Agreement),  if there has been a breach  by Parent of any  representation,
      warranty,  covenant or agreement  contained in this  Agreement,  or if any
      representation  or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue,  in either
      case that  would  reasonably  be  expected  to  result  in a failure  of a
      condition set forth in Section 8.03(a) or 8.03(b) (a  "Terminating  Parent
      Breach");  provided,  that if such Terminating Parent Breach is reasonably
      curable by Parent  within 20 days of the  occurrence  of such  Terminating
      Parent Breach through the exercise of its reasonable  best efforts and for
      as long as Parent continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts,  the
      Company may not terminate this Agreement  under this Section 9.01(f) until
      the earlier of the  expiration of such 20-day period and the Outside Date;
      or

(g)   Prior to the  approval  of this  Agreement  by the  requisite  vote of the
      stockholders  of  the  Company,  by  written  notice  of  the  Company  in
      accordance  with  Section  7.03(d),  if the Board shall have  concurrently
      entered into a definitive  agreement with respect to a Superior  Proposal;

      Parent Termination Expenses,  the Termination Fee shall be reduced by such
      Termination Expenses previously paid.

(e)   The Company  acknowledges  that the  agreements  contained in this Section
      9.03  are an  integral  part  of the  transactions  contemplated  by  this

      Parent would enter into this  Agreement.  If the Company shall fail to pay

      reimburse the other party for all costs and expenses  actually incurred or
      accrued by such other party  (including  reasonable  fees and  expenses of
      counsel) in connection  with the collection  under and enforcement of this
      Section 9.03, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime
      rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect such payment was required to be made.

      (the "Parent  Termination Fee") in immediately  available funds within two
      business days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to
      make such payment.

(g)   Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company's
      right to receive the Parent  Termination  Fee pursuant to Section  9.03(f)
      shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub or
      any of  their  respective  Affiliates,  stockholders,  partners,  members,
      directors,  officers, agents or Representatives for any loss suffered as a
      result of the  breach  of this  Agreement  by Parent or Merger  Sub or the
      failure of the Merger to be  consummated  and,  upon payment of the Parent
      Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.03(f), none of Parent, Merger Sub or
      any of  their  respective  Affiliates,  stockholders,  partners,  members,
      directors,  officers,  agents or  Representatives  shall have any  further
      liability or  obligation  relating to or arising out of this  Agreement or
      the Transactions.

behalf  of  their  respective  Boards  of  Directors  at any  time  prior to the
Effective  Time;  provided,  that,  after the adoption of this  Agreement by the
stockholders  of the  Company,  no  amendment  may be made that would reduce the
amount or change  the type of  consideration  into  which  each  Share  shall be
converted upon consummation of the Merger or that would otherwise by Law require
approval  of  the  stockholders  of  the  Company,   without  approval  of  such
stockholders. This Agreement may only be amended pursuant to a written agreement
signed by each of the parties hereto.

                              SECTION 9.05 - WAIVER
