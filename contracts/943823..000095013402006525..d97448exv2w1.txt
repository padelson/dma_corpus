AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as
of May 30, 2002 (this "Agreement"), is by and among Dave and Buster\'s, Inc., a
Missouri corporation (the "Company"), DandB; Holdings I, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and DandB; Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Missouri
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser").  
BACKGROUND   A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company, and a Special Committee (the "Special Committee") of the
Board of Directors of the Company (composed entirely of directors who have no
direct or indirect interest in the transactions contemplated hereby), each
have determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company by means of a
merger of Purchaser with and into the Company (the "Merger") on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   B. In furtherance
of the Merger, Parent proposes to cause Purchaser to make a tender offer (as
it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
"Offer") for the purchase of all the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"),
including the associated stock purchase rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant
to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of September 22, 1999,
between the Company and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as Rights
Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), at a price per share of $12.00, net cash to
each seller of Common Stock, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.   C. The Board of Directors of the Company, upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee, has approved the Offer and
recommends (subject to the limitations contained herein) that the Company\'s
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their shares of Common Stock
pursuant thereto.   D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent is entering into an agreement with certain
stockholders of the Company (the "Support and Exchange Agreement") pursuant
to which, among other things, such stockholders shall agree to take certain
actions to support the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
AGREEMENT   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein, the parties
agree as follows:       ARTICLE I  THE OFFER   1.1 THE OFFER.  
(a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than five business days after the date of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, commence the Offer within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, commence
the Offer and accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set
forth in Exhibit A (any of which may be waived by Purchaser in its sole
discretion, provided that, without the consent of the Company, Purchaser may
not waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in Exhibit A)). The
initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day following
the commencement of the Offer. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to
modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not, except as provided in the next sentence: (i)
reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Offer; (ii) reduce
the price per share of Common Stock to be paid pursuant to the Offer; (iii)
modify or add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A in any manner adverse
to the holders of Common Stock; (iv) extend the Offer; (v) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer; or (vi) otherwise amend the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, (x) extend the Offer for
up to a maximum of 10 additional business days, if at the initial expiration
date of the Offer any of the conditions to Purchaser\'s obligation to
purchase shares of Common Stock set forth herein or in Exhibit A are not
satisfied; (y) extend the Offer for any period required by applicable law,
including any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
applicable to the Offer; and (z) extend the Offer for any reason for a period
of not more than 10 business days beyond the latest expiration date
that would otherwise be permitted under this Section 1.1(a). If the Minimum
Tender Condition has been satisfied and all other conditions to the Offer
have been satisfied or waived but less than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares
(as defined below) have been validly tendered and not withdrawn on the
scheduled expiration date, Purchaser may accept and purchase all of the
Common Stock tendered in the initial offer period and may notify holders of
Common Stock of Purchaser\'s intent to provide a "subsequent offer period"
for tender of at least 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares pursuant to Rule
14d-11 of the Exchange Act, which subsequent offer period shall not exceed 15
business days. "Fully Diluted Shares" means all outstanding securities
entitled generally to vote in the election of directors of the Company on a
fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all
options, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into such voting
securities. It is agreed that the conditions to the Offer are for the benefit
of Parent and Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless
of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition (including any action
or inaction by Parent or Purchaser not inconsistent with the terms hereof).
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, pay for all shares of
Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that
Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer.     2     (b) On the
date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including the
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") and a Statement on Schedule 13E-3
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 13E-3"). The Schedule TO shall contain,
among other things, an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal
and other ancillary documents (such Schedule TO, including the Schedule 13E-3
and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents").
Each of Parent and Purchaser on the one hand, and the Company on the other
hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information is false or
misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Federal or state securities laws.
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company and its counsel
regarding any comments that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel receive from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and shall promptly
provide to the Company and its counsel copies of such written comments, if
any. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and Purchaser in responding to
any comments received from the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents.  
(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any shares of Common Stock that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.   1.2 COMPANY
ACTIONS.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
subject to the approval of the Merger by the Company\'s stockholders in
accordance with the Missouri BCL (as defined in Section 2.1), if
required.   (b) In accordance with Rule 14d-9(e) of the Exchange Act,
and prior to the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.23),
if any, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/ Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9,
as amended from time to time and including the exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule 14D-9") containing the recommendations described in Section 3.19
hereof and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company.
Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information is false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule
14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent and its counsel regarding any comments
the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the     3    Schedule 14D-9 and shall promptly provide to the
Parent and its counsel copies of such written comments, if any.   (c) In
connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to
furnish Purchaser promptly with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Common Stock as of the latest practicable
date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the
Company\'s possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Common
Stock, and shall furnish to Purchaser such information and assistance
(including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and
computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer
to the stockholders of the Company. Subject to the requirements of applicable
law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in
any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement is
terminated, shall, upon request, use reasonable efforts to deliver to the
Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession,
followed promptly by written confirmation of copies destroyed, if any.  
1.3 SINGLE STEP MERGER. In the event that, upon expiration of the Offer, at
least 66 2/3% of the Fully Diluted Shares have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn but the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied and no
shares of Common Stock are accepted by Purchaser for purchase and payment
pursuant to the Offer, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall proceed with
the Merger as expeditiously as reasonably possible subject to all applicable
terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, provided that
the obligations of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the Merger shall also
be conditioned on (i) satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in
Exhibit A (disregarding references to the Offer contained therein) other than
the Minimum Tender Condition and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 4.5 hereof or elsewhere in this Agreement, the funding
from third party lenders of at least $155 million of new debt financing and
availability of an additional $30 million line of credit from third party
lenders, in each case on commercially reasonable terms as determined in the
good faith judgment of Parent. If this Section 1.3 applies, (x) the "Merger
Consideration" referred to in Section 2.8(a) and elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be the per share price of the Offer in effect immediately prior to
expiration of the Offer and (y) Section 7.1(d) shall not apply.   ARTICLE
II  THE MERGER   2.1 THE MERGER. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General
and Business Corporation Law of the State of Missouri (the "Missouri BCL"),

defined in Section 2.3) whereupon the separate corporate existence of
Purchaser shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving

closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166 as soon as
practicable after all the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 have been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by law, waived by the parties entitled
to the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".   2.3
EFFECTIVE TIME. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare, and on the
Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter Parent shall file with the
Secretary of State for the State of Missouri, Articles of Merger (the
"Articles of Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Missouri BCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the Missouri BCL to give effect to the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with
such Secretary of State for the State of Missouri (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the ("Effective Time").   2.4 EFFECTS OF THE
MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the Missouri BCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.   2.5 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. The
Articles of Incorporation of Purchaser in effect at the Effective Time shall
be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with applicable law. The Bylaws of Purchaser in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with applicable law.   2.6 DIRECTORS. The directors of

Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such director\'s
successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified.   2.7 OFFICERS. The
officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such

CONVERSION OF COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Common Stock
or any shares of capital stock of Purchaser:   (a) Common Stock. Each issued
and outstanding share of Common Stock (other than shares of Common Stock to
be canceled and retired in accordance with Section 2.8(c) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.8(d)) shall be converted into the right to
receive in cash from the Company an amount equal to the price per share of
Common Stock paid pursuant to the Offer (the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of     5    Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.9, without interest.   (b)
Purchaser Capital Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Purchaser shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.   (c) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and
Purchaser-Owned Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock that is owned by the
Company, Parent or Purchaser, or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
or Parent, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.   (d) Dissenting Shares.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by Persons who are entitled to demand, and properly demand,
payment of the fair value of such shares pursuant to, and who comply in all
respects with, Section 351.455 of the Missouri BCL ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
but rather shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the Missouri BCL; provided, however, that if any
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses the right to payment of the fair value of such shares under the
Missouri BCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.8(a). The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for payment of the fair value of any shares of Common Stock,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.   (e) Stock Options.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock
Option (as defined in Section 3.3) which is then exercisable or becomes
exercisable as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, shall be canceled by the Company, and at the Effective
Time the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving
Corporation as soon as practicable after the Effective Time in consideration
for such cancellation an amount in cash equal to the product of a) the number
of shares of Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option and
b) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per share for such Company Stock Option, reduced by the amount of withholding
or other taxes required by law to be withheld. Except as provided herein or
as otherwise agreed by the parties, the Company Stock Plans and any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall terminate
as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the     6    Board
of Directors shall adopt such resolutions and the Company shall take
such other actions as are necessary to carry out the terms of this Section
2.8(e).   2.9 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall select a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates (the "Certificates") representing Common Stock. Parent shall
take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to the Paying Agent immediately following the Effective Time all the
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(a) (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").   (b) Promptly after
the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8(a) (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amount of cash into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented
by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person (as defined
below) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.9, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without
interest, into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means an
individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association,
trust or any unincorporated organization or other entity.   (c) The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II, upon
conversion of any shares of Common Stock, shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
any     7    Certificates formerly representing shares of Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.   (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (plus any interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of such funds) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates representing Common
Stock as provided in this Section 2.9 for six months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holder
of Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration.   (e) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.5), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Surviving Corporation.   (g) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any holder of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of Federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.   (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim which may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate and/or delivery of a suitable indemnity, the
Paying Agent will issue, in each case, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

which it is organized and has the requisite power and authority to own,
operate or lease the properties that it purports to own, operate or lease and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned,
operated or leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such qualification
necessary, except for such failures which, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse
Effect" means any event, change, effect or development that (i) is or is
reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the business, operations,
properties (including intangible properties), condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects, assets or liabilities of the Company and all of

equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all liens, security interests,
pledges, agreements, claims, charges or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
("Liens"), except as set forth on Schedule 3.2. There are no proxies with
respect to any shares of capital stock of any such Subsidiary. There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding securities of any of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries or to provide funds to or make any investment (in
the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any other Person. There are no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character
obligating any Subsidiary of the Company to issue or sell any shares of its
capital stock or other equity interests or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any capital stock or other equity interests. The Company
does not directly or indirectly own a greater than 5% equity interest in any
Person that is not a Subsidiary of the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any Person, (a) any
corporation with respect to which such Person, directly or indirectly through
one or more Subsidiaries, (i) owns more than 40% of the outstanding shares of
capital stock having generally the right to vote in the election of directors

the election of, a majority of the board of directors of such corporation,

the appointment or election of a majority of the directors or other Person or
body responsible for the governance or management thereof, or (d) any other
entity in which such Person has, and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries have,
directly or indirectly, (i) at least a 40%     9    ownership interest
or (ii) the power to appoint or elect or direct the appointment or election
of a majority of the directors or other Person or body responsible for the
governance or management thereof.   3.3 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists solely of (i) 50,000,000 shares of
Common Stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01
per share ("Preferred Stock"). As of the date of this Agreement: (A)

defined below), (ii) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having

Company to register any shares of capital stock of the Company. As used
herein, "Company Stock Option" means any option to purchase Common Stock and
"Company Stock Plans" means the plans providing for the grant of Company
Stock Options or any other issuance of capital stock of the Company and
listed in Schedule 3.3(b).   3.4 CORPORATE AUTHORITY; NONCONTRAVENTION.

3.6 SEC REPORTS.   (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1,

or any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is subject
to any order, judgment, injunction or decree, which, individually or in the

employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")),
employee pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and all
other bonus, stock option, stock purchase, benefit, profit sharing, savings,
retirement, disability, insurance, incentive, deferred compensation and other
similar fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of, or relating to, any employee of,
or independent contractor or consultant to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (together, the "Employee Plans"). The Company has delivered or
made available to Purchaser true and complete copies of (i) all Employee
Plans, together with all amendments thereto, (ii) the latest Internal Revenue
Service determination letters obtained with respect to any Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or 501(a) of the Code, (iii)
the most recent annual actuarial valuation report, if any, (iv) the last
filed Form 5500 together with Schedule A and/or B thereto, if any, (v) the
"summary plan description" (as defined in ERISA), if any, and all
modifications thereto communicated to employees, and (vi) the most
recent annual and periodic accounting of related plan assets. Neither the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries     13    nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents
has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA), which could result in the imposition of either a penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975
of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan. All Employee Plans have been approved
and administered in accordance with their terms and are in compliance in
all material respects with the currently applicable requirements prescribed
by all statutes, orders, or governmental rules or regulations currently in
effect with respect to such Employee Plans, including, but not limited to,
ERISA and the Code and there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened claims, lawsuits or arbitrations (other than routine
claims for benefits), relating to any of the Employee Plans, or the assets of
any trust for any Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trusts created thereunder intended to be
exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, either
(i) has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service to such effect or (ii) is still within the "remedial amendment
period," as described in Section 401(b) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder. All contributions or payments required to be made or accrued
before the Effective Time under the terms of any Employee Plan will have been
made or accrued by the Effective Time. No Employee Plan subject to Section
412 of the Code has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined
in ERISA), whether or not waived. The Company has not incurred nor reasonably
expects to incur any liability under Title IV of Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code other than liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to insurance premiums (which premiums have been paid
when due). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries contributes nor
within the six-year period ending on the date hereof has any of them
contributed or been obligated to contribute, to any pension or
retirement plan which is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3 (37)
of ERISA). No Employee Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending
beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than coverage
mandated by applicable law. No condition exists that would prevent the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Employee
Plan providing health or medical benefits in respect of any active employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as may otherwise be limited
or prohibited by applicable law. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9, no
amounts payable under any Employee Plan will fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.9, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
a related event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any other payment or
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or officer.   3.10 INFORMATION SUPPLIED.
None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for

Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any
time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent

a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;

with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, as applicable, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

Section 6.8) and the Proxy Statement, if required, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based solely on information supplied by Parent or Purchaser for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.   3.11 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS; PERMITS.

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The permits, licenses,
approvals, certifications and authorizations from any Governmental Entity
(collectively, "Permits") held by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are valid and sufficient in all material respects for all business presently
conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written claim or notice nor has
any knowledge indicating that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not
in compliance with the terms of any such Permits and with all
requirements, standards and procedures of the Governmental Entity which
issued them, or any limitation or proposed limitation on any Permit, except
where the failure to be in compliance, individually or in the aggregate, has

BOARD AND SPECIAL COMMITTEE ACTION.   (a) The Board of Directors of the
Company, at a meeting duly called and held, duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions: (i) approving this Agreement, the Support and Exchange
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger; (ii) determining that the terms of the
Offer and the Merger are fair from a financial point of view to and in the

the holders of Common Stock accept and tender their shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer; and (iv) recommending that the Company\'s stockholders
adopt this Agreement.   (b) The Special Committee, at a meeting duly called
and held, at which all the Special Committee members were present duly and

and the Company have received the opinion of Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin,
the Special Committee\'s financial advisor, to the effect that, as of the

point of view. The written confirmation of such opinion has been provided to
Purchaser.   3.21 CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION. Following the actions of
the Board of Directors of the Company and the Special Committee as described
in Section 3.19, there is no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share" or
other similar state takeover statute or regulation (each, a "Takeover
Statute") or comparable takeover provision of the Restated Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company that applies or purports to apply to
the Company, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   3.22 RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Company has taken all
necessary action so that none of the execution of this Agreement and the
Support and Exchange Agreement, the making of the Offer, the acquisition of
shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the
Merger will (i) cause the Rights to become exercisable, (ii) cause Purchaser
or any of its affiliates to become an Acquiring Person (as such term is
defined in the Rights Agreement) or (iii) give rise to a Distribution Date
(as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement). The Company has furnished
Purchaser with true and complete copies of evidence of all actions taken and
all other documents that fulfill the requirements of this Section 3.22.  
3.23 VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock is the only vote necessary (under
applicable law or otherwise) to approve the Merger (the "Company Stockholder
Approval").   3.24 INSURANCE. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries maintains insurance policies (the "Insurance Policies") against
all risks of a character and in such amounts as are usually insured against
by similarly situated companies in the same or similar businesses. Each
Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and
enforceable, and all premiums due thereon as of the date hereof have been
paid in full. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.24, none of the Insurance
Policies will terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other materially
adverse manner) by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects with the provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is the
insured party. No insurer under any Insurance Policy has cancelled or
generally disclaimed liability under any such policy or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such policy. All
material claims under the Insurance Policies have been filed in a timely
fashion. Since the Company\'s formation, there have been no historical gaps
in insurance coverage of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.    
24     3.25 SUPPLIERS. Set forth in Schedule 3.25 is a list of the ten
largest suppliers of the Company on a consolidated basis based on the
dollar value of materials or products purchased by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2002. Since such date,
there has not been, nor as a result of the Offer or the Merger does the
Company have a reason to anticipate there to be, any change in relations with
any of the major suppliers of the Company or its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The existing suppliers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are adequate in all material respects for the operation of the
Company\'s business as operated on the date hereof.   3.26 LABOR. Since the
enactment of Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the
"WARN Act"), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated
a "plant closing" or a "mass layoff" (as such terms are defined in the WARN
Act); nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been affected by any
transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of any similar state, local or foreign law.
None of the employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries has suffered
an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act).   ARTICLE IV

forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue;
(ii) any of such representations and warranties that is not so qualified
becoming untrue in any material respect; or (iii) any condition to the Offer
set forth in Exhibit A, or any condition to the Merger set forth in Article

Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall
it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor, agent or representative of the
Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, "Company Representatives") to: (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of, any Company
Takeover Proposal (as defined below); (ii) enter into any agreement with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal; or (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal; provided,
however, that, at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, the
Company\'s Board of Directors may, in response to a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) that was not solicited by the Company or any Company
Representative on or after the date hereof and that did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 5.2(a), and subject to providing prior written
notice of its decision to take such action to Parent and compliance with
Section 5.2(b), participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such
Superior Proposal and furnish information concerning the Company to the
Person making such Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that
constitutes 25% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or 25% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide proposal made by a third party to
acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company
and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment (based on the written advice of its financial advisors) (x) is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the third
party making such proposal, and (y) provides greater present value to the
Company\'s stockholders than the cash consideration to be received by such
stockholders pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the Offer and the
Merger may be amended from time to time.   (b) The Company\'s Board of
Directors shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of the existence
of any Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal.   (c) Nothing contained in
this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Board of Directors from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from changing its recommendation with
respect to the Offer and this Agreement, or making any disclosure to the
Company\'s stockholders, if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to take any such action would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable
law.     30     ARTICLE VI  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   6.1 PREPARATION
OF PROXY STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.   (a) If the approval and adoption
of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders is required by law, the
Company shall, at Parent\'s request, as soon as practicable following the
expiration of the Offer, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form, and the Company shall use its best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur any event that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall
use its best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company\'s stockholders as promptly as practicable after filing with the
SEC.   (b) To the extent that this Agreement requires Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall, if requested by Parent and as soon
as practicable following the expiration of the Offer, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval (including establishing the record date, if requested by Parent, to
be the date immediately after the date Purchaser first purchases any shares
of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer). The Board of Directors, subject to
Section 5.2(c), shall recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Company Stockholder Approval. If Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent
shall acquire at least 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares, the parties shall, at
the request of Parent, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the
Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
Offer without a stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 351.447 of
the Missouri BCL.   (c) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Common
Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other shares of Common Stock
owned by Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent to vote to adopt and
approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting or,
at the election of Parent, to be subject to action by written consent in
favor of the Company Stockholder Approval pursuant to Section 351.273 of the
Missouri BCL.   6.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. The Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, and to
Parent\'s directors, officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisers, financing sources and other representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to
all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent:     31    (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities laws; and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. All
nonpublic information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be subject
to the confidentiality agreement dated as of March 26, 2002, as amended
and/or supplemented from time to time thereafter, between the Company and
Investcorp International Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreement").   6.3
REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger
and the other obligations of such party hereunder, including: (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties; (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of this Agreement, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed; and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate this Agreement and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall: (x) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement; and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Offer and the Merger
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Offer and the Merger. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to require any party to waive any substantial rights or agree to any
substantial limitation on its operations.   (b) The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Purchaser shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of: (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in
this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not
so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii)
the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.    
32     6.4 BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) For one year after the Effective Time,
Parent shall either (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to
sponsor and maintain the Employee Plans (except for any Company Stock Plan),
or (ii) provide benefits to the employees of the Company who continue to be
employed by the Surviving Corporation (the "Company Employees") under
employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements that in the
aggregate are substantially similar to those benefits provided to the Company
Employees by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any
stock option or other equity compensation plan or program). With respect any
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement (other than stock
options or stock based compensation) sponsored or maintained by Parent and
offered to the Company Employees in addition to or as a substitute for the
Employee Plans, Parent shall give the Company Employees service credit for
their employment with the Company for eligibility and vesting purposes as if
such service had been performed with Parent. If Parent offers health benefits
to the Company Employees under a group health plan that is not a Employee
Plan, Parent shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusions under such
group health plan to the extent coverage exists for such condition under the
Employee Plan and shall credit each Company Employee with all deductible
payments and co-payments paid by such Company Employee under the Company\'s
health plan prior to the Closing Date during the current plan year for
purposes of determining the extent to which any such Company Employee has
satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-
pocket maximum under any health plan for such plan year.   (b) Following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to honor (subject to this Section 6.4 and Section 6.5) all
obligations under all of the employment, severance, consulting and similar
agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries existing on the date hereof
that are set forth on Schedule 6.4(b).   (c) Nothing herein shall be
construed as giving any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, except as
set forth in Schedule 6.4(c), any right to continued employment following the
Effective Time.   6.5 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) After the earlier of (1) the
Effective Time or (2) the consummation of the Offer, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Party"),
against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and judgments, fines,
losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (provided that any
such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation)) incurred by reason of the fact that such Person is or
was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time to the full extent permitted by law, such right to include advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit to the extent
permitted by the Missouri BCL; provided, however, that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether such Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnity hereunder (including without limitation
whether,     33    with respect to the indemnification of such
Indemnified Party by the Surviving Corporation, an Indemnified Party\'s
conduct complies with the standards set forth under the Missouri BCL), shall
be made at Parent\'s expense by independent counsel mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Indemnified Party; provided further, that nothing herein shall
impair any rights or obligations of any present or former directors or
officers of the Company.   (b) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the Company\'s
obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for
expenses) the members of the Special Committee and current or former
directors or officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries for acts or
omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective
Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of
this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company\'s Restated Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws, individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such
obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms of the Company\'s Restated Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws and such individual indemnity agreements from the
Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions.   (c) For a period of six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and
financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous) with respect
to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent
such premiums exceed 150% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof
by the Company for such insurance (such 150% amount, the "Maximum Premium").
If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained
at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain
the most advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\' insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company
represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is as set forth on Schedule
6.5.   6.6 FEES AND EXPENSES. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as provided in Section
8.2.   6.7 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.   (a) Through the Effective Time, Parent
and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other obligations
under this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement relating thereto prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.    
34      (b) The Company shall give at least 24 hours\' prior written
notice to Parent Sub of any proposed press release or other public statement
not relating to the Offer, the Merger or any of the obligations under this
Agreement, which notice shall include the text of such press release
or public statement.   6.8 DIRECTORS. Promptly upon the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Purchaser for, any shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of
directors on the Company\'s Board of Directors as will give Purchaser,
subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation
on the Board of Directors equal to at least that number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, which is the product of (a) the total number of
directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the directors elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage that (i) such
number of shares of Common Stock so accepted for payment and paid for by
Purchaser plus the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise owned by
Purchaser or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (ii) the number of such
shares outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, cause Purchaser\'s
designees to be so elected; provided, however, that in the event that
Purchaser\'s designees are appointed or elected to the Board of Directors,
until the Effective Time the Board of Directors shall have at least two
directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are
not officers of the Company (the "Independent Directors"); and provided
further that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent
Director shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement
or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall
designate two Persons to fill such vacancies who shall not be officers,
stockholders or affiliates of the Company, Parent or Purchaser, and such
Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall take all action
requested by Parent necessary to effect any such election, including mailing
to its stockholders the Information Statement containing the information
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder (the "Information Statement"), and the Company shall make such
mailing with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (provided that Purchaser shall
have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be
included in the Information Statement with respect to Purchaser\'s
designees). In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at
the option of Purchaser, either increase the size of the Board of Directors
or obtain the resignation of such number of its current directors as is
necessary to enable Purchaser\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the
Board of Directors as provided above.   6.9 COOPERATION WITH FINANCING
EFFORTS. The Company agrees to provide, and will cause each of the
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, employees and advisors to
provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any
financing in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including without limitation, participation in meetings, due diligence
sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents, the execution and
delivery of any commitment letters, underwriting or placement agreements,
pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
requested certificates or documents, including a customary certificate of the
chief financial officer of the Company with     35    respect to
solvency matters, comfort letters of accountants, legal opinions and real
estate title documentation as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser.  
6.10 CONSENTS. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the consents listed in Schedule 6.10.   6.11 TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any
Takeover Statute shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or resolution on the transactions
contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   7.1 CONDITIONS

of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver
on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:   (a) If
required by law, the Company shall have obtained the Company Stockholder
Approval.   (b) The waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act, if any, shall have been
terminated or shall have expired. Any consents, approvals and filings under

temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint
or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in
effect.   (d) Purchaser shall have previously accepted for payment and paid

(which for purposes of this Section 7.1(e) shall be read as though none of
them contained any Material Adverse Effect or other materiality
qualifications) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of
this Agreement and at the Effective Time, except where the failure of such
representations and warranties in the aggregate to be true and correct in all
respects, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
that the representations in Section 3.3 (Capital Structure) as to the number
of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and Company
Stock Options shall be true and correct in all respects.     36    
ARTICLE VIII  TERMINATION   8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the Company Stockholder Approval:   (a) By mutual written consent of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company;   (b) By either Parent or the Company
if:   (i) the Merger is not consummated on or before  October 31, 2002 (the
"Outside Date"), unless the failure to consummate  the Merger is the result
of a willful or material breach this Agreement  by the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement; provided, however,  that the passage of such period
shall be tolled for any part thereof  during which any party shall be subject
to a nonfinal order, decree,  ruling or action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the  consummation of the Merger;   (ii) any
Governmental Entity issues an order, decree  or ruling or takes any other
action permanently enjoining, restraining  or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger and such order, decree, ruling or  other action shall have become
final and nonappealable;   (iii) subject to Section 1.3, as the result of
the  failure of any of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A to this 
Agreement, the Offer shall have terminated or expired in accordance  with its
terms without Purchaser having purchased any shares of Common  Stock pursuant
to the Offer; or   (iv) upon a vote at a duly held stockholders meeting  to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Stockholder  Approval is
not obtained; provided, however, that this Agreement may  not be terminated
by Parent pursuant to this clause (iv) if Parent or  Purchaser shall have
failed to vote the shares of Common Stock held by  it in favor of the
Merger;   (c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement,
which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Exhibit A;   (d) subject to Section 1.3, by Parent,
if any of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A shall become incapable of
fulfillment prior to the Outside Date and shall not have been waived by all
applicable parties, and the Offer shall have terminated or expired by its
terms without Purchaser having purchased any shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer;   (e) by Parent, if the Board of Directors fails to make,
or withdraws, modifies or changes, in any manner adverse to Parent and
Purchaser, its approval or recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this
Agreement; or   (f) by the Company, (i) if Parent or Purchaser breaches
or fails to perform in any material respect any of their respective
covenants contained in this Agreement or (ii) if prior     37    to
consummation of the Offer, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have provided written notice to Parent that the Company is prepared, upon
termination of this Agreement, to enter into a binding written definitive
agreement for a Superior Proposal; provided that in the case of this clause
(ii): (A) the Company shall have complied with Section 5.2 in all respects;
(B) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have reasonably concluded in
good faith in consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel
that such proposal is a Superior Proposal; (C) Parent does not make, within
five business days after receipt of the Company\'s written notice referred to
above in this clause (ii), an offer that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have reasonably concluded in good faith in consultation with
its financial advisor and outside counsel is at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company as the Superior Proposal; and (D) the Company
shall have paid Parent the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b) concurrently
with such termination.   8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.   (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect,
without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, other than Section 6.2, Section 6.6, this Section 8.2 and Article
IX; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement.   (b) If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or 8.1(f)(ii), the
Company shall pay to Parent the sum of $5.0 million in cash. In addition, the
Company shall reimburse Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates for all out-
of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by any of them in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and preparation of the Offer and the Merger and
any related financings (including, without limitation, fees and costs of
attorneys and accountants and other advisors and fees payable to
banks, financial institutions and their respective agents and fees of
financial printers engaged by Parent, Purchaser or their affiliates). This
Section 8.2 will survive any termination of this Agreement. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to
this Section 8.2, the Company shall pay to Parent all costs and expenses
(including attorney\'s fees) in connection with collecting such amounts,
together with interest on the amount of the unpaid transaction expenses and
termination fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.   ARTICLE IX  GENERAL PROVISIONS
