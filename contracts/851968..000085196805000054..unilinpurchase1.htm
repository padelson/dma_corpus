Property used by such Affiliated Company in the course of its business. Each
Affiliated Company is the owner of or has a license, with the right to
sublicense, to any Intellectual Property sold or licensed to a third party by
such Affiliated Company in connection with such Affiliated Company\'s
business operations, and such Affiliated Company has the right to convey by
sale or license any Intellectual Property so conveyed. No Affiliated Company
is in Default under any of its Intellectual Property licenses. At the date
of this Agreement, no proceedings have been instituted, or are pending or to
the knowledge of the Company threatened, which challenge the rights of
any Affiliated Company with respect to Intellectual Property used, sold or
licensed by such Affiliated Company in the course of its business, nor has
any person claimed or formally alleged any rights to such Intellectual
Property. The conduct of the business of any Affiliated Company does not
constitute a Default of any Intellectual Property rights of any other Person.
No Affiliated Company is obligated to pay any recurring royalties to any
Person with respect to any such Intellectual Property. Every officer,
director, employee or supplier of any Affiliated Company, involved in the
development of Intellectual Property, assigned any interest in any
Intellectual Property to an Affiliated Company and undertook confidentiality
covenants.

with any Laws or Orders, where such noncompliance is reasonably likely to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Change, (B)
threatening to revoke any Permits, or (C) requiring any Affiliated Company to
enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease and desist order,
injunction, formal agreement, directive, commitment, or memorandum of
understanding, or to adopt any board resolution or similar undertaking, that
is likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Change.

 

4.1.7  Legal Proceedings

 

There is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, explicitly threatened in writing against any Affiliated Company, or
against any director, officer or employee in their capacities as such, or
against any asset, interest, or right of any of them, that is likely to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Change, nor
are there any Orders outstanding against any Affiliated Company, that are
reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Change.
