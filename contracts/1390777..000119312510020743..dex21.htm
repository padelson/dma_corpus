REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF THE SELLER

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (provided that disclosure in any section of such Company
Disclosure Schedule shall apply to any other section to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
is relevant to such other section of this Agreement), Seller hereby
represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

Section 2.1 _Organization and Related Matters_.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

-14- (b) Section 2.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of all the Subsidiaries of the Company. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities evidencing ownership
of the Companys Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and such shares or other securities are owned by the Company or another of
its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Lien (other than any Permitted Lien)
with respect thereto. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or
other commitments or agreements of any character relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock or other securities or ownership or equity interest of
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or otherwise obligating any of the
Companys Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any such stock, securities, or interests. Each Subsidiary of the
Company (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation, partnership
or limited liability company or other legal entity under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization reflected on Section 2.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property or
the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified (except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect) and (iii) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. PFPC Trust Company is
not a "bank" as defined in Section 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended, 12 U.S.C. Section 1841\.

Section 2.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Company
consists of 3,000 shares of Company Common Stock, all of which are issued and
outstanding and have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid,
non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. All of the Company Common Stock
is owned by Intermediate Holdco free and clear of any Liens. Except as set
forth above, as of the date hereof, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other securities or ownership or equity interests of the Company, or
otherwise obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any such stock, securities or interests.

or cause to be consummated the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Seller. No other
corporate proceedings (including any approvals of Sellers stockholders) on
the part of Seller are necessary to approve this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and to consummate or cause to be consummated the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Seller and assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer, this Agreement constitutes, and, when
executed and delivered by Seller in accordance with this Agreement and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Buyer, the
other Transaction Documents will constitute, the valid and binding
obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i) the effect
of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
arrangement, moratorium or other laws affecting or relating to the rights of
creditors generally, or (ii) the rules governing the availability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies and general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law.

(b) Intermediate Holdco has all requisite limited liability company power
and authority to sell to Buyer the Company Common Stock. No other limited
liability company proceedings on the part of Intermediate Holdco are necessary
to sell to Buyer the Company Common Stock.

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents by Seller nor the consummation by Seller or
Intermediate Holdco of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor
compliance by Seller or Intermediate Holdco with any of the terms or
provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) violate any provision of the
certificates of incorporation or bylaws of Seller or the organizational
documents of Intermediate Holdco or (ii) assuming that the consents, waivers,
approvals and notices referred to in Section 2.4 are duly obtained or given,
(x) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
writ, decree or injunction applicable to Seller, Intermediate Holdco or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any
provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under or in any payment conditioned, in whole or in part, on
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, accelerate the
performance required by or rights or obligations under, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
Seller, Intermediate Holdco or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract
to which Seller, Intermediate Holdco or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties, assets or business activities may be bound or affected,
except (in the case of clause (ii)(y) above) for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults or the loss of benefits which, either individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or do not relate to a Material Contract. 



 

-16- Section 2.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (a) such consents,
waivers, approvals and notices as are set forth in Section 2.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements under the

Seller, Intermediate Holdco, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
required to obtain any material consents, waivers or approvals of, give
notices to, or make any material filings, declarations or registrations with
any Governmental Authority in connection with (i) the execution and delivery
by Seller of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or (ii)
the consummation by Seller and Intermediate Holdco of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 2.5 _Financial Statements; Absence of Liabilities_.

(a) Section 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth true and correct
copies of (a) the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 (the "Company Balance Sheet") and 2007,
and the related audited consolidated statements of income, consolidated
statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2008 and 2007, and (b) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of November 30, 2009 (the "Unaudited Company Balance

Company and its Subsidiaries for the eleven-month period ended November 30,
2009 (the financial statements described in clauses (a) and (b) being, the

Company Balance Sheet fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the
other Company Financial Statements (including the related notes thereto, where
applicable) present fairly in all material respects the results of the
operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods therein set forth, in each case in accordance with
GAAP, subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements to normal
year-end adjustments (none of which will be material) and the absence
of notes, consistently applied (except as indicated in the related notes
thereto).

(b) The Target Tangible Capital Statement set forth in Exhibit A-1 was
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Company Balance Sheet and the Unaudited Company Balance
Sheet from the Books and Records of the Company applying
accounting principals, policies, practices and methodologies which Seller
considers to be reasonable.

(c) None of the Companies or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability except
(i) those which are adequately reflected on or reserved against in the
Unaudited Company Balance Sheet or disclosed in the related notes thereto,
(ii) liabilities arising under Material Contracts since November 30, 2009
other than as a result of a default or breach thereof, (iii) those which have
been incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since November 30, 2009, none
of which individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (iv) those which, individually and
in the aggregate, are immaterial in nature.



 

-17- Section 2.6 _Material Contracts_.

(a) As of the date hereof neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

all such relevant times, and since January 1, 2008, each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has been in material compliance with all such Permits, and
all such material Permits are currently in full force and effect. There are
no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, that could
reasonably be expected to result, nor will entering into the transactions
contemplated hereby reasonably be expected to result, in the revocation,
cancellation or suspension, or any adverse modification, of a material Permit
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2008,
none of Seller, Intermediate Holdco, the Company or any Subsidiary of the

properties, assets or business activities may be bound, except (in the case of

Schedule, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements under the HSR Act,

ownership, operation and use of the properties and assets and the conduct of
the businesses of Buyer and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except

reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Buyer and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with their respective obligations under such
Permits, with such exceptions as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Except for matters that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of Buyer,

all such information to be preserved after the Closing Date for the same
period of time that such party and its Affiliates preserve such information
in accordance with their respective record retention policies and Applicable
Law. In addition, if reasonably requested by the other party from time to time
after the Closing, Buyer will provide Seller with access to the facilities and
employees of the Company and Seller will provide Buyer with access to the
facilities and employees of Seller (for the purposes st forth above), to the
same extent provided by Seller to Buyer prior to the Closing pursuant to the
provisions of the first sentence of this paragraph. At the request of either
party, the parties shall negotiate in good faith the terms of a mutually

investigative demand or similar process) or regulatory process or request,
provided that in the event of any disclosure pursuant to legal process such
Person exercises its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the

cooperating with Seller to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the non-
public information required to be disclosed.

non-public information in its possession relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the identity of and the mandates of Clients; provided,
however, that Seller shall not be liable hereunder with respect to any
disclosure to the extent such disclosure is pursuant to legal process
(including pursuant to the assertion of Sellers rights under this Agreement)

Affiliates other than the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however that
Buyer shall not be liable hereunder with respect to any disclosure to the
extent such disclosure is pursuant to legal process (including pursuant to the
assertion of Buyers rights under this Agreement) (by interrogatories,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) or regulatory
process or request, provided that in the event of any disclosure pursuant to
legal process Buyer exercises its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
the confidentiality of the non-public information disclosed, including by

the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with
any proceeding by 



 

-41-  a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the
FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Authority or other person, give the
other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences. Buyer and Seller may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be
provided to the other under this Section 4.5(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Buyer, Seller, or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 4.5(a) and 4.5(b), each of Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the
Termination Date, including defending through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or any private party; and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Applicable Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as possible (and in any event no later than the Termination Date),
including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries, (y) otherwise taking or committing
to take actions that after the Closing would limit Buyers and/or its
Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
operate and/or retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets
of the Buyer, the Company and/or their respective Subsidiaries, and (z)
agreeing to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or Buyers or Buyers Subsidiaries ability to operate or retain, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any action
contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and (z) is conditioned upon the consummation
of the Stock Purchase and that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
require Buyer to take any actions specified in this Section 4.5(c) that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured on a scale
relative to the GIS Business, taken as a whole) on Buyer or the GIS Business.

(d) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or
give, at Buyers sole expense, all Client, vendor, landlord, supplier and
other consents, approvals or notices required for the GIS Business to continue
to operate and to provide services to its existing Clients following the
Closing in the same manner as, and under no less favorable terms than, before
the Closing.

(e) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall not, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree or announce
its intention to acquire by merger or consolidation, or by purchasing a
substantial equity interest in or a substantial portion of the assets of, or
by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association
or 



 

-42-  other business organization or division thereof or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, where Buyer has been advised by a Governmental
Authority that consummation of such acquisition would reasonably be expected
to prevent the parties from obtaining any approval or authorization required
under Regulatory Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein.

(f) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate reasonably and in good faith
with each other to the extent necessary to enter into the Continuing
Relationship Agreement, effective as of the Closing.

Section 4.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party to this Agreement
shall give prompt notice to the other party hereto, to the extent known by
such party, of (a) any event or existence of any condition that has caused or
would reasonably be expected to cause any of its representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
at any time after the date of this Agreement, (b) the occurrence of any matter
or event that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, (c) any failure on its part to
comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (d)
any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (e) any Proceeding pending or, to the
applicable partys Knowledge, threatened against the party relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement or be deemed to amend or
supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
as the case may be; provided further that a breach of this Section 4.6 shall
not be considered for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing
conditions set forth in Article V or give rise to a right of termination
under Article VI or a right to indemnification under Article VIII if the
underlying breach or breaches with respect to which the other party failed to
give notice would not result in the failure of the closing conditions set
forth in Article V or would not result in the ability of such non-breaching
party to terminate this Agreement or to obtain indemnification, as the case
may be.

Section 4.7 _Expenses_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear its own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
including any filing fees with respect to the HSR Act and compliance with
other Regulatory Laws payable in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that any fees and expenses incurred pursuant to
Section 4.5(d) in connection with the obtaining of any third party consents
shall be borne by Buyer.

Section 4.8 _Further Assurances_. Each party to this Agreement shall, at the
request of the other, at any time and from time to time following the Closing
Date, execute and deliver to the requesting party such further instruments as
may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order more effectively to
confirm or carry out the provisions of this Agreement.



 

-43- Section 4.9 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Company shall, except as set forth on
Section 4.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, retain responsibility for,
or to the extent applicable, shall assume, each Company Plan (including any
related trust, insurance contract or other funding source or arrangement) and
shall honor each Company Plan in accordance with its terms as in
effect immediately before the Closing, provided that nothing herein shall
limit the right of the Company or Buyer to amend or terminate such plans,
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms. From and after the
Closing: (i) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for all liabilities under the
Company Plans; and (ii) Seller shall be solely responsible for liabilities
under the Seller Plans.

(b) Upon the Closing Date, without any action by a Company Employee, Seller or
Buyer, each Company Employee other than a Company Employee in the United
States on disability or military leave of absence as of the Closing Date (an
"Inactive Employee") shall continue to be an employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided that nothing herein shall limit the right of the
Company or Buyer to terminate the employment of any such Company Employee on
or after the Closing Date. Each Inactive Employee shall be transferred to
Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) no
later than immediately prior to the Closing. Each Inactive Employee who is
available to return to active employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the 180-day anniversary of the Closing (or such later return date as
shall be required under Applicable Law) shall be permitted so to return and
shall be treated as continuing his/her employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries retroactive to the Closing Date. Subject in all cases to
Applicable Law, Inactive Employees who do not return to such active
employment by such 180-day anniversary (or applicable later date) shall not
become Continuing Employees and shall remain employees of Seller. During the
period from the Closing Date until December 31, 2010 (the
"Benefit Continuation Period"), Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided,
compensation opportunities and employee benefits for the benefit of Company
Employees who continue employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries after
the Closing ("Continuing Employees") which, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable in value to the compensation opportunities and
generally available employee benefits (other than retiree medical) provided to
the Continuing Employees by Seller, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing
Employee who is terminated without cause during the Benefit Continuation
Period, subject to such Continuing Employees execution and non-revocation of
a release acceptable to Buyer, cash severance pay (before Taxes) and welfare
benefit continuation (other than retiree medical) in each case no
less favorable than the value of the cash severance pay (before Taxes) that
would have been paid and/or provided to such Continuing Employee under the
cash severance pay formula (and any related notice period) and the welfare
benefit continuation (other than retiree medical) provided under Sellers
Displacement Benefits Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
under the employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, providing
benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"),
each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its predecessors before the 



 

-44-  Closing, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with
respect to any frozen or grandfathered plan, (ii) with respect to benefit
accruals (including "compensation credits") under any defined benefit or
"cash balance" pension plan, or (iii) to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (A) each Continuing Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to that
under a Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), and (B) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Closing and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan.

(d) Effective as of the Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall transfer
sponsorship of the Business 401(k) Plan, together with all assets (including
cash, cash equivalents or other mutually acceptable property) and liabilities
(including loans) with respect to the account balances of each participant
thereunder, to the Company or its Subsidiaries, and following the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
shall have sole responsibility for the Business 401(k) Plan, and Seller and
its Subsidiaries (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall have no
responsibility for or liability under the Business 401(k) Plan.

(e) Effective as of the Closing with respect to those Continuing Employees
who, but for their failure to satisfy the age and service requirements, would
be eligible to participate in Sellers Plans which provide medical and/or
pharmaceutical benefits to retirees of Seller and its Subsidiaries (the
"Sellers Retiree Medical Plan") as of the Closing Date ("Grandfathered
Employees"), Seller will cause its Sellers Retiree Medical Plan to be amended
to the extent necessary or appropriate to: (i) maintain and continue to credit
interest to the Post Retirement Medical Accounts ("PRMA") established and/or
maintained with respect to any Grandfathered Employee as of the day before the
Closing Date; and (ii) create a PRMA with an initial $5,000 contribution (or
such higher amount as may be provided to similarly situated active employees
of Seller who initially become eligible for a PRMA) and thereafter credit it
with interest for those Grandfathered Employees who subsequently satisfy the
age and service conditions for the creation of a PRMA and receipt of an
initial contribution under the terms of Sellers Retiree Medical Plan if
service with Seller and the Company before the Closing and service with Buyer
and the Company after the Closing ("Combined Service") is taken into account
under Sellers Retiree Medical Plan. Such Grandfathered Employees who later 



 

-45-  terminate employment with the Company on or after age 55 (or who would
otherwise be treated as vested under the terms of the PRMA if they had so
terminated from active employment with Seller and their Combined Service were
credited under Sellers Retiree Medical Plan) shall be permitted to elect
coverage under Sellers Retiree Medical Plan in accordance with its terms as
then in effect; provided, however, that such Grandfathered Employees shall be
permitted to use the amounts accumulated in their PRMA as hereinabove
described to pay the then premiums for such Sellers Retiree Medical Plan;
which premiums shall not exceed those charged to similarly situated
former employees of Seller electing such coverage following their retirement
from active employment of Seller. For purposes of clarification and not
limitation of Section 4.9(c), Continuing Employees shall be credited with
their service with Seller and Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes
of determining their eligibility for any Plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries
which provide medical and/or pharmaceutical benefits to retirees of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries; provided that any such employee who ultimately receives
benefits under Sellers Retiree Medical Plan shall not receive retiree medical
benefits under such Plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall
be construed as a limitation on the ability of Seller to amend or terminate
the Sellers Retiree Medical Plan in accordance with its terms.

(f) Nothing in this Section 4.9, express or implied, shall be construed or
interpreted to amend any employee benefit plan or to confer upon any
individual, including any employee or former employee, any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 4.10 _Third Party Proposals_. Seller shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or
facilitate inquiries or proposals, or enter into any agreement with respect
to, or initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions with any
Person concerning, any acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial
portion of the assets of or of any capital stock of or other ownership
interest in the Company or any merger or business combination with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case other than in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"), or furnish
any information to any Person contacting them or making an inquiry with
respect to a potential Acquisition Proposal. In addition, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any and all confidentiality
agreements obtained by Seller prior to the date hereof in connection with the
potential sale of the GIS Business to any other party.

Section 4.11 _Efforts of Parties to Close_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement continuing through the Closing, each party hereto agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the
conditions precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including the execution
and delivery of any documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that
are reasonably required for the consummation of such transactions. During the
period from the date of this Agreement and continuing through the Closing,
except as required by Applicable Law or with the prior written consent of the
other party to this Agreement and subject to Section 4.5(c), no party to this
Agreement shall take any action or fail to take any action within its
reasonable control intended or reasonably expected to (x) result in any
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article V not being satisfied, (y)
result in a violation of any provision of this Agreement in any material
respect, or (z) adversely affect or materially delay the receipt of any of
the requisite regulatory approvals.



 

-46- Section 4.12 _Non-Hire of Employees_. Seller agrees that, for a period of
18 months from the Closing Date, without the consent of the Buyer, it will
not, and will not permit its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the officers,
directors or employees of it or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, hire any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is such as of
immediately following the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall (a) apply to the hiring of any person who responds to
general solicitations through media advertisements or to the hiring of any
person through employment search firms in the ordinary course of business that
are not specifically targeted at such employees or (b) prohibit the hiring of
any person who at the time of such hiring has not been an employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for at least six months; provided, however, that
such six month period shall not apply to an employee who was terminated by
Buyer, the Company or an Affiliate thereof following the Closing.

Section 4.13 _Termination of Intercompany Agreements_. Except as set forth in
Section 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Transition Services
Agreement or the Continuing Relationship Agreement or as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 4.1, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
and cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, immediately prior to the
Closing, (a) settle all Tax accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
and (b) execute and deliver such releases, termination agreements and
discharges as are necessary to terminate all Contracts among any Seller or any
Affiliate (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), on one hand, and the
Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt,
termination of such agreements shall not terminate any payable or receivable
to extent already accrued or accruable as of the Closing.

Section 4.14 _Intercompany Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause any Intercompany Indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing to be converted into Company Common Stock (and Seller shall be
entitled to take necessary actions in connection therewith, including amending
the Certificate of Incorporation), which shall be part of the shares
of Company Common Stock to be purchased by Buyer pursuant to Article I.

Section 4.15 _Non-competition_.

(a) For a period of four years from the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), except as permitted by this Section 4.15, Seller shall not (and
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to), without the prior written consent
of Buyer, (i) engage in or carry on any Competitive Activities (as defined in
Exhibit D), or (ii) have an equity interest in any Person that engages in any
Competitive Activities; _provided_ , _however_ , that "Competitive Activities"
shall in no event be deemed to include performing any act or conducting any
business (A) contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement or the
Continuing Relationship Agreement, or (B) to retail customers of Seller or any
of its Affiliates or investment professionals licensed with Sellers or
Sellers Affiliates private banking, wealth management or retail banking
operations.

(b) This Section 4.15 shall cease to apply (i) to any Person at such time as
it is no longer an Affiliate of Seller, or (ii) upon the occurrence of an
arms length transaction in which any Person acquires or combines with Seller
in a transaction in which (A) Persons who are 



 

-47-  directors of Seller immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction
do not constitute upon the consummation of such transaction a majority of the
board of directors of the Person which survives such transaction (or the
publicly traded parent thereof) and (B) the holders of the common stock of
Seller hold upon the consummation thereof 60% or less of the shares of equity
securities normally entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
Person, and shall not apply to any Person that, in an arms length
transaction, acquires or combines with one of Sellers Affiliates or acquires
assets, operations or a business from Seller or one of its Affiliates if such
Person is not an Affiliate of Seller after such transaction is consummated. No
restriction in this Section 4.15 shall apply to BlackRock, Inc. or any of its
controlled Affiliates.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.15, nothing in
this Agreement shall preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller or any of its
Affiliates from (i) acquiring, owning or holding up to 10% of the outstanding
securities of any entity whose securities are listed and traded on a national
securities exchange or market or any securities required to be registered
under the Exchange Act; (ii) holding or exercising rights of ownership with
respect to any security in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise for the benefit
of a third party not affiliated with Seller; (iii) acquiring more than 10% of
the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests in, but less than a
Controlling Interest in, any Person that derives 25% or less of its total
annual revenues in its most recent fiscal year from Competitive Activities;
or (iv) acquiring a Controlling Interest in any Person that derives less than
25% of its total annual revenues in its most recent fiscal year from
Competitive Activities; provided, however, that in the case of this clause
(iv) Seller shall divest or enter into a binding agreement to divest to an
unaffiliated third party, or cause its applicable Affiliate to divest or enter
into such an agreement, with respect to that portion of such Person that
engages in Competitive Activities as soon as reasonably practicable, and in
any event not later than one year, following the acquisition of such ownership
or interest (except that the obligations set forth in this proviso shall not
apply to Seller or any of its Affiliates in the event that Seller or any of
its Affiliates consummate the acquisition of such Controlling Interest at any
time during the final year of the Restricted Period); or (v) performing any
act or conducting any business contemplated by this Agreement or
the Transition Services Agreement.

(d) If Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the
provisions of this Section 4.15, Buyer and the Company shall have the right
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to
Buyer or the Company under law or in equity (including the right and remedy to
recover from Seller all monetary damages suffered by Buyer or the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, as the result of any acts
or omissions constituting a breach of this Section 4.15) to have such
provision specifically enforced by any court having jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach may cause
irreparable injury to each of Buyer and the Company and that money damages may
not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer or the Company. 

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 4.15
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 4.15 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by 



 

-48-  Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court of competent jurisdiction
is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic,
product or service, or other limitations permitted by Applicable Law. The
covenants contained in this Section 4.15 and each provision hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity
or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any
other jurisdiction.

Section 4.16 _Coates Acquisition Agreement_. To the extent that Milestone
Consideration or Earnout Consideration is not reflected in the applicable
components of the Closing Tangible Capital Statement, Seller shall promptly
reimburse the Company or its applicable Subsidiary for any
Milestone Consideration or Earnout Consideration (as each such term is
defined in the Coates Acquisition Agreement) payable by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Coates Acquisition Agreement following the
Closing.

Section 4.17 _Other Agreements_. (a) Buyer agrees either (i) to enter into
such agreements and arrangements with or for the benefit of the
counterparties to the comfort letters and agreements set forth in Section
4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Covered Arrangements") such
that on and after the Closing Date, Seller and each of its Affiliates is
fully and unconditionally released from any liability or obligation of the
Company or its Subsidiaries under or with respect to the Covered Arrangements
or (ii) to enter into an agreement or agreements with Seller
reasonably satisfactory to Seller in which Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any liability under the Covered
Agreements. Promptly upon completion of the matters referred to in the
preceding sentence, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall release all Liens held by Seller and such Affiliates on
any property or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing their
obligations under the Covered Arrangements.

 

(b) Buyer and Seller agree with respect to the agreement set forth in Schedule
4.17(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Additional Arrangement")
that the parties will negotiate in good faith and execute and deliver an
agreement pursuant to which they will agree upon an equitable allocation of
the rights and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, under the Additional Arrangement, including
a provision whereby each such group of parties will agree to pay the amounts
with respect to the delivery of services to such group pursuant to the
Additional Arrangement and to indemnify the other group for the failure to do
so.

TERMINATION

(a) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as follows:

(i) by written consent of the parties hereto;

(ii) by either of the parties hereto, if any Governmental Authority shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.1(a)(ii) shall not be
available to any party hereto whose failure to comply with Section 4.5
has been a cause of, or resulted in, such action;

(iii) by Seller, if there shall be a breach by Buyer of any representation or
warranty or any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.3 and which breach
cannot be cured or has not been cured (to the extent necessary to avoid a
failure of such a condition) within 30 calendar days (but not later than the
Termination Date) after the giving of written notice to Buyer of such breach;



 

-51- (iv) by Buyer, if there shall be a breach by Seller of any representation
or warranty or any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.2 and which
breach cannot be cured or has not been cured (to the extent necessary to avoid
a failure of such a condition) within 30 calendar days (but not later than
the Termination Date) after the giving of written notice to Seller of such
breach; or

(v) by Seller or Buyer if the Closing does not occur by the close of business
on November 1, 2010 (the "Termination Date"); provided, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, no party hereto may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
clause (v) if the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination Date was
caused by the failure of such party to act in good faith or to use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur.

(b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by the delivery by
the party terminating this Agreement to each other party of a written notice
of such termination. If this Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and
void and have no further force or effect, except as provided in Section 6.2.

Section 6.2 _Survival after Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 6.1 hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby
are not consummated, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force
and effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto, except that
the provisions of Sections 4.4(a) and (d), 4.7, this Section 6.2, Article
VIII, Section 9.8, and Section 9.9 and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.2 shall relieve any party to this
Agreement of liability for any willful and material breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.1 _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall, or shall cause their relevant Affiliates to,
jointly make a timely and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and, if permissible, similar elections under any applicable state or
local income Tax laws, with respect to the acquisition of the Company
and each of its Domestic Subsidiaries that is treated as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes, other than Albridge Solutions (collectively, the
"Section 338(h)(10) Elections").

(b) Buyer shall make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and, if
permissible, similar elections under any applicable state or local income Tax
laws, with respect to the Companys Foreign Subsidiaries. Buyer shall deliver
to Seller documentary evidence reasonably satisfactory to Seller that such
election under Section 338(g) of the Code has been made in a timely manner,
which documents shall include copies of the relevant IRS forms filed by Buyer
in making such election.



 

-52- (c) Buyer shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price, which shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
Albridge Solutions) as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Allocation"), and
deliver such Allocation to Seller within 90 days following the date upon
which the amount of the Final Tangible Capital is determined pursuant to
Exhibit A. The Allocation shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with
Section 7.1(f). Seller shall have the right to review such Allocation and, to
the extent Seller disagrees with the Allocation, Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing, within 30 days after receipt of such Allocation of any objections. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement regarding the Allocation,
then within 30 days following Buyers receipt of Sellers objection, any
disagreement shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm or valuation
expert (the "Independent Expert") jointly selected by Seller and Buyer. Any
Allocation determined pursuant to the decision of the Independent Expert shall
incorporate, reflect and be consistent with Section 7.1(f). The Allocation, as
prepared by Buyer if no timely Seller objection has been given, as adjusted
pursuant to any agreement between the parties or as determined pursuant to the
decision of the Independent Expert shall be final (the "Final Allocation").
Any fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by the
parties.

(d) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in the preparation of all forms,
attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, including IRS Form 8023 and 8883 and any similar forms under
applicable state and local income Tax laws (collectively, the "Section
338 Forms") in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation. Buyer and
Seller shall, or shall cause their relevant Affiliates to timely file such
Section 338 Forms, if any, with the applicable Taxing Authorities. Seller and
Buyer agree that neither of them shall, or shall permit any of its
Affiliates, to revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Elections following the filing of
the Section 338 Forms without the prior written consent of Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be. Except to the extent required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, neither Seller nor Buyer
shall take any position inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and
the Section 338 Forms, if any.

(e) Each of Buyer and Seller shall deliver to the other party at the Closing
one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections.

(f) Seller and Buyer agree that at least U.S. $285,000,000 of the Purchase
Price is attributable to the stock of Albridge Solutions.

Section 7.2 _Tax Indemnification_. 

(a) Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) harmless from and against,
without duplication (i) any and all Excluded Taxes (other than Taxes arising
from or in connection with any action taken or transaction undertaken by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) after the Closing that is outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business unless required or contemplated by 



 

-53-  this Agreement), (ii) any Taxes arising from or in connection with any
breach by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any covenant contained in this
Agreement, (iii) any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant
to Section 7.9, and (iv) all costs and expenses, including reasonable legal,
accounting, appraisal, consulting or similar fees, actually incurred relating
to the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree and
acknowledge that the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2(a) shall not
apply in connection with the subject matter of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 2.11(c).

(b) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and
against (i) any and all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
Excluded Taxes) and any Taxes arising from or in connection with any action
taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) after the Closing that is outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business unless required or contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any Taxes
arising from or in connection with the breach by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates of any covenant contained in this Agreement, (iii) any Transfer
Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section 7.9, and (iv) all
costs and expenses, including reasonable legal, accounting, appraisal,
consulting or similar fees actually incurred relating to the foregoing.

(c) Payment in full of any amount due under this Section 7.2 shall be made to
the indemnified party in immediately available funds no later than the later

indemnifying party and (ii) five (5) days prior to the date on which
the underlying amount is required to be paid by the indemnified party.

Section 7.3 _Filing of Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall timely prepare and file or shall cause to be timely prepared
and filed (i) any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes
Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding any Tax Return, other than any
income Tax Return for periods ending on or before the Closing Date, that
includes only the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and is due after
the Closing Date), and (ii) any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date.
Buyer shall not amend or revoke any such Tax Returns (or any elections
relating thereto). 

(b) Buyer shall, except to the extent that such Tax Returns are the
responsibility of Seller under Section 7.3(a), be responsible for the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(c) For any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to a Straddle Period that is the responsibility of Buyer under Section 7.3(b),
Buyer shall (i) prepare and file such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
unless otherwise required by Applicable Law and (ii) deliver to Seller for its
review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of such proposed Tax Return
(accompanied, where appropriate, by an allocation between the Pre-Closing
Period and the Post Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Return) at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date (giving effect to any
validly obtained extension) thereof.



 

-54- Section 7.4 _Tax Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to any refund or credit of
or against (i) Excluded Taxes, and (ii) any Taxes for which Seller is
responsible pursuant to Item 2 of Section 8.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (and, in each case, any interest or penalty rebate with respect to
such refund or credit). Buyer shall be entitled to any refund or credit of or
against any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any interest or
penalty rebate with respect to such refund or credit) other than refunds or
credits to which the Seller would be entitled under the preceding sentence.
Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the
party entitled pursuant to this Section 7.4 to a refund or credit of Taxes,
the amount of such refund or credit within ten (10) days after such refund is
received or applied against another Tax liability, as the case may be, in each
case net of any costs to the party receiving such refund or credit.

Section 7.5 _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date,
each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide the other
party hereto with such cooperation, documentation and information as either of
them reasonably may request in connection with (a) filing any Tax Return or
claim for refund, (b) determining a liability for Taxes, an indemnity or
payment obligation under this Article VII or a right to a refund of Taxes, (c)
conducting any Tax Proceeding (which shall include granting any powers of
attorney reasonably requested by the party entitled to control a
Tax Proceeding pursuant to Section 7.6) or (d) determining an allocation of
Taxes between a Pre-Closing Period and a Post-Closing Period. Such cooperation
and information shall include providing copies of all relevant portions of
relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant accompanying schedules and
work papers (or portions thereof) and other supporting documentation.

Section 7.6 _Contests_.

(a) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim in respect of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, then the party hereto first receiving notice of such
Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or
parties hereto; provided, however, that the failure of such party to give such
prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations
under this Article VII, except to the extent that the other party is actually
prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis
for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

(b) Seller shall have the exclusive right to control, at its own expense, any
audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or against any
Taxing Authority (a "Tax Proceeding") in respect of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date;
provided, however, that with respect to any Tax Proceeding solely in respect
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to
have an adverse impact that is material on Buyer and its Affiliates including
the Company and its Subsidiaries after Closing, Seller shall consult with
Buyer before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding.



 

-55- (c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding for a Straddle Period of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall have the right to control, at its own
expense, such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that (i) Buyer shall provide
Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax
Proceeding, (ii) Buyer shall consult with Seller before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iii) Buyer shall
defend such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only
party in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iv) Seller shall
be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding, at its own expense, and (v)
Buyer shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control, at its own expense, any
Tax Proceeding involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
any Tax Proceeding described in Section 7.6(b) or (c)); provided, however,
that if such Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on Seller or any of its Affiliates that is material Buyer shall consult
with Seller before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding.

Section 7.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All liabilities and obligations between
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, under any Tax sharing agreement in effect prior to the Closing
Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and terminate as of the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or
obligations under any such Tax sharing agreement.

Section 7.8 _Coordination; Survival_. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, indemnification for Tax matters, including
indemnification for Taxes and the procedures with respect thereto (but
excluding indemnification for Taxes set forth in item 2 of Section 8.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall be governed by Article VIII)
shall be governed exclusively by this Article VII (and not by any provision of
Article VIII). The indemnification provisions of this Article VII shall
survive until the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations plus an
additional 60 days.

Section 7.9 _Transfer Taxes_. Any and all sales, use, transfer, stamp,
documentary, recording or similar Taxes imposed upon the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be
borne and paid in equal parts by Buyer and Seller, regardless of the Person
liable for such Taxes under Applicable Law. The parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate any potential Transfer Taxes and
shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of any related Tax Returns.

Section 7.10 _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Buyer agree that,
except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" (within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), all indemnification payments made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, provided, however, that any such adjustment shall incorporate, reflect
and be consistent with Section 7.1(e). 



 

-56- ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Agreements_. The
respective representations and warranties of Seller and Buyer contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing but shall expire on the 18-month
anniversary of the Closing Date, except with respect to, and to the extent
of, any claim of which written notice in accordance with Section 8.4 has been
given in good faith by one party to the other prior to such expiration;

and (d)-(i) (Taxes) shall not survive the Closing. The respective covenants
and agreements of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement (including the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Article VIII) shall survive the
Closing, provided that any such covenants and agreements that by their terms
are to be performed prior to the Closing Date shall survive the Closing only
until the first anniversary of the Closing, except to the extent governed by
Section 7.8. The period from the Closing to the expiration, if any, of a
representation or warranty hereunder shall be referred to with respect to a
claim for indemnification thereunder as the "Survival Period."

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. (a) Subject to the provisions of this
Article VIII, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its
officers, directors and employees and Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees") from and after the Closing Date for the period set forth in
Section 8.1 (including any extension thereof as expressly provided for in
such Section) from and against any and all claims, costs, expenses, losses,
damages, liabilities, awards, judgments, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys and consultant fees and expenses) (subject to Section
8.6, "Damages") actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees to the extent,
directly or indirectly, relating to or caused by:

(i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties (such
representations and warranties to be read for this purpose without reference
to any Excluded Seller Qualification) made by Seller herein other than any
Designated Seller Representation or, subject to Section 8.2(b), any
representation set forth in Section 2.11;

(ii) any breach of any Designated Seller Representations (such representations
and warranties to be read for this purpose without reference to any Excluded
Seller Qualification); or

shall indemnify, defend 



 

-57-  and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees for any and all Damages in respect
of the matters set forth in Section 8.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
provided that in no event shall any claim for Damages be asserted under both
Section 8.2(a)(i) and this Section 8.2(b).

Section 8.3  _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the provisions of this
Article VIII, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
officers, directors, and employees and Affiliates (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnitees") from and after the Closing Date for the period set
forth in Section 8.1 (including any extension thereof as expressly provided
for in such Section) from and against any and all Damages actually incurred by
the Seller Indemnitees to the extent caused by:

(i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties
(such representations and warranties to be read for this purpose without
reference to any Excluded Buyer Qualification) made by Buyer herein other than
any Designated Buyer Representation;

(ii) any breach of any Designated Buyer Representations (such representations
and warranties to be read for this purpose without reference to any Excluded
Buyer Qualification); or

(iii) any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement (other than a breach of any such covenant or
agreement in Article VII hereof, it being understood that the sole remedy for
any such breach being pursuant to Article VII).

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedure_. Subject to Section 8.4(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, which sets forth additional procedures in
respect of matters that are subject to Section 8.2(b):

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Damages by the party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party"), including any claim by a
third party described in Section 8.4(c) hereof that might give rise to
indemnification hereunder, or the earlier discovery of any facts or
circumstances that may result in an indemnification claim hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the party from which indemnification is
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") a certificate (the "Claim Certificate"),
which Claim Certificate shall be delivered within the relevant Survival
Period, if any, and shall:

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Damages, or
anticipates (specifying the events or occurrences giving rise to such
anticipation) that it will incur liability for Damages for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement;
and

(ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Damages included in
the amount so stated to the extent known, the date such item was paid or
properly accrued (if applicable), the basis for any anticipated liability and
the nature of the breach of representation or warranty or claim to which each
such item is related and the computation of the amount, if reasonably capable
of computation to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled
hereunder;



 

-58- provided, however, that any delay in delivery (except for any delivery outside
of the relevant Survival Period, if any) of a Claim Certificate by an
Indemnified Party as provided in this Section 8.4 or any defect in such Claim
Certificate shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, except to the extent, and only to the extent,
that such failure prejudices the rights of such Indemnifying Party.

(b) Claims for Damages specified in any Claim Certificate with respect to
which the parties agree in writing to be due, or which are finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be due, are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as "Agreed Claims." Within 10 Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claims, subject to the limitations
of this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party an amount equal to the Agreed Claim by cashiers check or wire transfer
to the bank account or accounts designated in writing by the Indemnified Party
not less than one Business Day prior to such payment.

(c) Promptly after the assertion by any third party of any claim against any
Indemnified Party that may result in the incurrence by such Indemnified Party
of Damages for which such Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement and within the relevant Survival
Period, such Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice describing in reasonable detail such claim and such
Indemnifying Party may, at its option, assume the defense of the Indemnified
Party against such claim (including the employment of counsel, who shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party) at such Indemnifying
Partys expense. Any Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action or claim and to participate in the defense thereof,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume such control, and shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel, if (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall have failed, within 15 Business Days after having been notified by
the Indemnified Party of the existence of such claim as provided in the
preceding sentence, to assume the defense of such claim or to notify the
Indemnified Party in writing that it shall assume the defense of such claim,
(ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, (iii) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses the assertion of which
would be adverse to the interests of the Indemnified Party or (iv) the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that the
assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate
due to a conflict of interest (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel). No Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any settlement of any
such action or claim effected without the consent of the Indemnifying Party,
but if settled with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, or if there
be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the Indemnifying
Party shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party from and
against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying
Party shall assume the defense of any claim in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 8.4(c), the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, 



 

-59-  conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of such claim if
the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, the settlement is in excess of the
maximum remaining liability set forth in Section 8.5 hereof or Section 8.5 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or the settlement imposes
injunctive or other non-monetary equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party each agrees to fully
cooperate in all matters covered by this Section 8.4(c), including, as
required, the furnishing of books and records, personnel and witnesses and
the execution of documents, in each case as necessary for any defense of such
third party claim and at no cost to the other party (provided that any
reasonable out-of-pockets expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred in
connection with the foregoing shall be considered part of Damages hereunder).

(d) The parties hereto hereby consent to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which a third party claim is brought against any Indemnified Party
for purposes of any claim that such Indemnified Party may have under this
Agreement with respect to such third party claim or the matters
alleged therein, and agree that process may be served on any Indemnifying
Party with respect to such third party claim by service of process delivered
in the manner and to the address for such Indemnifying Party provided by
Section 9.5 hereof. 

Section 8.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 8.5(c), no claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or (iii) (with respect to Sections 4.1 and 4.6
only) or Section 8.3(i) or (iii) (with respect to Section 4.6 only) may be
made by the Indemnified Parties until the aggregate amount of all such claims
for which Damages are otherwise recoverable is in excess of $20,000,000 (the
"Threshold Amount"), after which the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to
make claims for any Damages to the extent exceeding the Threshold Amount.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except
Section 8.5(c) hereof, the aggregate liability for Damages or other claims
for indemnification under Section 8.2(a)(i) or (iii) (with respect to Sections
4.1 and 4.6 only) or Section 8.3(i) or (iii) (with respect to Section 4.6
only) shall not exceed an aggregate amount equal to $250,000,000.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
limitations set forth in Section 8.5(a) and Section 8.5(b) shall not apply in
the case of fraud or willful or intentional breach of a covenant or agreement
set forth herein, and nothing in this Article VIII shall limit any rights any
Person may have with respect to any claim for fraud or willful or intentional
breach of a covenant or agreement set forth herein.

Section 8.6  _Punitive Damages; Certain Offsets_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party for
special, incidental, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary Damages as
a result of any breach of this Agreement or other agreements referred to
herein or of any private right of action that any party may have hereunder
against another party hereto; provided that the foregoing shall not limit the
right of any Indemnified Party to indemnification in accordance with the this
Agreement with respect to any component of any claim, settlement, award or
judgment against such party by any unaffiliated third party. For purposes of
this Article VIII, "Damages" shall be



 

-60-  net of any insurance or other recoveries (net of any related deductible or
expenses incurred in securing such recovery, any self-insurance and any
increase in premiums resulting from such recovery) payable to the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to any right
of indemnification hereunder. Any indemnification payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party through a reduction in Taxes otherwise due
as a result of the Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party. The
amount of the Damages arising out of any claim included as a liability
in calculating Final Tangible Capital shall be calculated net of the amount
so included.

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing Date, this Article VIII
shall provide the exclusive remedy for any breach of any representation or
warranty contained herein, other than any claims with respect to Taxes (which
are governed exclusively by Article VII, subject to Section 7.8), except in
the case of common law fraud or willful or intentional breach relating to this
Agreement or with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are
available.
