 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 2, 2010 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and among SW Merger Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), SW Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Southwest Water
Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

  



  

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger") in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), and each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares"), will be converted
into the right to receive $11.00 **** cash in U.S. dollars (other
than Shares held in the treasury of the Company, Shares owned by Merger Sub,
Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or the Company, and
any Dissenting Shares);

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee of the Company Board (the
"Special Committee"), has (i) approved and adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) determined that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders (the "Stockholders"), (iii)
declared the advisability of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, and
(iv) resolved to recommend that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement, in
each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

# ** **

  

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").

  



  

SECTION 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at the offices of Locke Lord Bissell and Liddell LLP
in Los Angeles, California as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
five (5) business days, after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII (excluding the delivery of officers certificates
and directors resignations and any other conditions that, by their nature,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), or such time, date and place as Parent and
the Company otherwise agree to in writing.  As part of the Closing, the
parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with

  



  



        
   

  



  

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required
by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the
date and time of such filing of the Certificate of Merger, or such later time
as may be agreed to by the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, being the "Effective Time").

  



  

SECTION 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

SECTION 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Subject to Section
6.6(b), at the Effective Time:

  



  

### (a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended to
read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein and by Law, except that the name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be Southwest Water Company **** and the
provisions of Merger Subs certificate of incorporation relating to the
incorporator of Merger Sub shall be omitted from the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation; and

  

### 

  

### (b) the bylaws of the Company shall be amended to read in their entirety
as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided therein, by the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and by Law.

  

### 

  

SECTION 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

  



  

# **ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT ON STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES**

  

# ** **

  

SECTION 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

  



  

### (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the Stockholders or holders
of any of shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

  

### 

  

#### (i) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) and
any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive

  



        
   

  



  

#### $11.00 **** cash in U.S. dollars (the "Merger Consideration"), payable,
without interest, to the holder of such Share, less applicable withholding
taxes, if any, required to be withheld pursuant to Section 2.4(b);

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) except as provided in Section 2.1(a)(iii), each Share held in the
treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid or delivered with
respect thereto;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) each Share owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered with
respect to such Shares; and

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

#### 

  

### (b) At the Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of such Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender or transfer of such Shares in accordance with Section 2.4.

  

### 

  

### (c) On or prior to the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share
of Company Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Company in accordance
with the terms thereof.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Common Stock Purchase Warrants and Company Stock
Plans and Awards_.

  



  

### (a) The Company has issued certain warrants to purchase Company Common
Stock that are outstanding on the date hereof (the "Common Stock Purchase
Warrants"). After the Effective Time, no Common Stock Purchase Warrants shall
be outstanding and (absent the exercise thereof to acquire Company Common
Stock prior to the Closing) no holder of Common Stock Purchase Warrants shall
have any right in respect of any Company Common Stock or Merger Consideration
by virtue of having held any such Common Stock Purchase Warrants.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company has awarded options to purchase Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stock Options"), performance contingent restricted stock units and
performance shares, pursuant to which the holders are entitled to receive
Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by the increase
on the Companys return on invested capital (the "Company Stock-
Based Awards") and restricted shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company
Stock Awards") under (i) the Second Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan,
(ii) the Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors,
and (iii) the 2006

  



        
   

  



  

### Equity Incentive Plan (as amended through the date of this Agreement,
collectively referred to as the "Company Stock Plans").

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by Parent and the
applicable holder thereof, as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested (to the
extent not already then vested) and shall be cancelled and shall cease to
represent a right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash in U.S.
dollars, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option (with the aggregate
amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded down to the nearest cent),
less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with
respect to such payment pursuant to Section 2.4(b). No holder of a Company
Stock Option that has an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect
to such Company Stock Option before or after the Effective Time and all such
Company Stock Options shall be cancelled for no consideration.

  

### 

  

### (d) Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by Parent and the
applicable holder thereof, as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock-Based
Award, whether or not vested or exercisable, which is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time as of the Effective Time shall become fully
vested (to the extent not already then vested) and shall be cancelled
and shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars (with the aggregate amount of such payment to
the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying a
particular Company Stock-Based Award (less, if applicable, the grant price or
the amount of any other required payment or reduction pursuant to the terms
of such Company Stock-Based Award), less applicable withholding taxes, if
any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment pursuant to Section
2.4(b).

  

### 

  

### (e) Except as may otherwise be agreed in writing by Parent and the
applicable holder thereof, as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Award, the restrictions of which have not lapsed immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall become fully vested and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, without
interest, equal to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i).

  

### 

  

### (f) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all action necessary to terminate, as of the Effective
Time, the Company Stock Plans.  Except as set forth in Section 2.2(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall take all action necessary to
(i) provide that the Amended and Restated Employee Qualified Stock Purchase
Plan, dated May 28, 1998, as amended by the First Amendment to Amended and
Restated Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan, dated June 8, 2007, and the
Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, dated
April 8, 2005 (collectively, the "Purchase Plans"), shall be (A)
indefinitely suspended as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later
than three (3) business days) following the date of this Agreement and (B)
terminated as of the Effective Time, and (ii) cause all amounts in accounts
of participants in these plans not yet

  



        
   

  



  

### applied as of the date of such suspensions to be returned to such
participants as promptly as practicable following such suspensions.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

### (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and
to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who
shall have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the Agreement nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. The holders of
the Dissenting Shares shall instead be entitled to receive after the
Effective Time payment of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by holders who shall have failed to perfect
or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon cease to
be Dissenting Shares and be deemed to have been converted into, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such
Shares relate, without any interest thereon.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and a copy of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other related notices or instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

  

### 

  

SECTION 2.4 _Payment Fund; Surrender or Transfer of Shares; Stock Transfer
Books_.

  



  

### (a) At least five (5) business days prior to the anticipated Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall designate a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of Shares
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in U.S.
dollars in an amount sufficient to make the payments pursuant to Section
2.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, and that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.1(a) out of the Payment Fund. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except to the extent
expressly provided in this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares which were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in customary form) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates and transfer
of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (the "Uncertificated
Shares") for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent for
cancellation of a Certificate or transfer of Uncertificated Shares, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash in U.S.
dollars (by wire transfer, check or other method reasonably determined by the
Paying Agent in order to provide timely payment hereunder) equal to the
Merger Consideration to which such holders Shares relate. Until surrendered
or transferred as contemplated by this Section 2.4(b) (and except as provided
in Section 2.1(b) or with respect to any Dissenting Shares), each Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon such
surrender or transfer. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to any Shares. If any holder of Shares is
unable to surrender such holders Certificates because such Certificates have
been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu
thereof an affidavit and indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation.  Each of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of Shares, such amount as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
applicable Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  

### 

  

### (c) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation (or any of its successors or assigns) shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had
been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders
of Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying
Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such
holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares held by
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Share to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

  

### 

  

### (d) Immediately upon the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.

  



         
 

  



  

SECTION 2.5 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company shall be increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration.

Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all other bonus, stock
option, stock purchase, restricted share, incentive, deferred compensation,
retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or
other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all employment, retention,
termination, change in control, severance or other contracts or agreements,
whether legally enforceable or not, to which the Company or any organization
or other entity with whom the Company is or was treated as a single employer
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(a)(14) or
(b)(1) of ERISA (the "ERISA Affiliate") is a party, with respect to which the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation or which are, or have been
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate (collectively and whether or not material, the
"Employee Plans"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
express or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (i) to
create, incur liability with respect to or cause to exist any Employee Plan,
other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any
contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits to any individual,
or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any Employee Plan, other than with
respect to a modification, change or termination required by this Agreement,
the Merger, ERISA, the Code or to otherwise comply with applicable Laws.
 The Company has expressly reserved its right to amend or terminate
each Employee Plan.

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate (including any entity
that during the past six years was a ERISA Affiliate) has now or at any time

meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Sections 412 or 436 of the Code
or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer plan (within the meaning
of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), or (iii) a single employer pension
plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate could incur liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA. No condition exists and no event has occurred that could
constitute grounds for termination of any Employee Plan, and neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur,
any material liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the
termination of, or complete or partial withdrawal from, any plan covered or
previously covered by Title IV of ERISA. No funding deficiency has
been incurred with respect to any Employee Plan, whether or

  



        
   

  



  

### not waived in accordance with Section 412 of the Code. No "reportable
event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, and no event described
in Section 4041, 4042, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA has occurred in connection with
any Employee Plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth on Sections 3.10(a) and 6.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Employee Plan exists that (A) provides for the
payment of separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any
person, (B) obligates the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to pay
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or
partially as a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or
(C) could result in the payment to any present or former employee, director
or consultant of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of any money or other
property or accelerate or provide any other special vesting or other rights
or benefits to any current or former employee of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate as a result of the consummation of the Merger (whether alone or in
connection with any subsequent event). Except as disclosed in Section
3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no contract, plan or
arrangement covering any current or former employee of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate that could give rise to the payment of any amount that would
not be deductible, including pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) or
Section 280G of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (d) Except to the extent required under ERISA Section 601  _et. seq_. and
Code Section 4980B, none of the Employee Plans provides for or promises
medical, group health, disability or retiree life insurance benefits for a
period following retirement or other termination of employment to any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate.

  

### 

  

### (e) Each Employee Plan has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the Subsidiaries have performed
all obligations required to be performed by them under, and are not in
default in any material respect under or in violation of, any Employee Plan.
No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with
respect to any Employee Plan (other than routine claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries have any
knowledge of any fact or event that could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any such Action. No material operational or plan failure (within the
meaning of Rev. Proc. 2008-50) exists with respect to any Employee Plan that
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (f) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination letter or
prototype opinion letter upon which the plan sponsor is entitled to rely from
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") that the Employee Plan is
so qualified and each trust established in connection with any Employee Plan
which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and no fact or event exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such qualification or
exemption.

  

### 

  

### (g) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Employee Plan.

  



        
   

  



  

### (h) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with
respect to any Employee Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All
such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no
such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental
Authority and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such challenge or
disallowance.  All contributions and contribution obligations have been
reflected on the most recent financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Reports.

  

### 

  

### (i) The Company has complied with all reporting and disclosure
obligations to each Governmental Authority and all participants
and beneficiaries with respect to each Employee Plan required by the terms of
such Employee Plan and any statutes, orders, rules or regulations, including
ERISA, the Code and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

### 

  

### (j) With respect to the Employee Plans which are "group health plans"
under Section 4980B of the Code or Section 607(1) of ERISA, there has been
timely compliance in all material respects with all requirements imposed
under Section 4980(B) of the Code and Part 6 of Title 1 of ERISA, so that
neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any (and will
not incur any) loss, assessment, tax penalty, or other sanction with respect
to any such Employee Plan. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(j) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to the Companys Employee Plans
which are "group health plans" under Section 9832 of the Code or Section 733
of ERISA, such Employee Plans have been maintained in compliance in all
material respects with all requirements imposed under Subtitle K of the Code
and Part 7 of Title 1 of ERISA. If the Company or any of its Employee
Plans are treated as a "covered entity" under the Privacy and Security
Standards at 45 CFR Parts 160 through 164, such covered entities have
complied in all material respects with such standards beginning with the
effective date of such standards to such covered entities.

  

### 

  

### (k) The Company and all ERISA Affiliates have complied in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code, including all guidance from the IRS,
with respect to any interest granted or awarded pursuant to an Employee Plan
that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code), and no person had a legally binding right to an
amount under such a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which to the
knowledge of the Company would subject such person to the Taxes imposed by
Section 409A of the Code.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.11 _Labor and Employment Matters_.

  



  

### (a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, are there any activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any such employees. As of the date hereof and in the three previous
years, there is and has been no strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage
or lockout occurring, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any threat
thereof, by or with respect to any employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws relating to the employment of labor,

to be withheld from employees of the Company or any Subsidiary and are not
liable for any material arrears of wages, Taxes, penalties or other sums for
failure to comply with any of the foregoing. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree, or
citation by, any Governmental Authority, relating to employees or employment
practices. Since December 31, 2008, except as disclosed in Section 3.11(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule and for matters that, if adversely
determined, result in losses and expenses (including reasonable expenses of
counsel) that have not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i)
there is no charge or proceeding with respect to a violation of any
occupational safety or health standards asserted or pending with respect to
the Company and (ii) the Company has not received written notice or threat of
any suits, actions or other proceedings in connection with the Company or its
Subsidiaries or employees that arise out of or relate to any of the Companys
or any Subsidiarys employment practices (including proceedings before the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Authority
responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices).

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.12 _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

### (a) Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of all trademarks, service marks, domain name registrations, trade dress,
logos, and other source identifiers, including registrations and applications
for registration thereof, of and by the Company and the Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any patents or pending
patent applications, or registrations or pending applications for

Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as currently conducted in
all material respects.

licensor) or use of any Intellectual Property material to the conduct of
their respective businesses as they are conducted as of the date hereof. All
such agreements listed on Section 3.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are deemed to be Material Contracts for purposes of Sections 3.15 and 5.1 of
this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) The conduct by the Company and the Subsidiaries of their businesses
as currently conducted, and the use of any Intellectual Property in
connection therewith, do not conflict with, infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate in any material respect the Intellectual Property rights of
any third person. No Actions have been asserted or are pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened against the Company or any Subsidiary (i)
based upon or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the use by the
Company or any Subsidiary of any Intellectual Property, (ii) alleging that
any services provided by or processes used by the Company or any Subsidiary
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual

  



        
   

  



  

### Property rights of any third person, or (iii) alleging that any
Intellectual Property is being licensed or sublicensed by or to the Company
or the Subsidiaries in conflict with the terms of any license or other
agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no person is
materially infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the
Intellectual Property owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (d) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company and the Subsidiaries have used reasonable commercial efforts to
maintain the confidentiality of their trade secrets and other
confidential Intellectual Property used or held for use by the Company or the
Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

SECTION 3.13 _Taxes_.

(whether or not shown on any such Tax Return), except for any amounts being
disputed in good faith for which adequate provision has been made to the
extent required by GAAP consistently applied in the consolidated financial
statements included in the Company SEC Documents. Except as set forth on
Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all such Tax Returns are
true, correct and complete in all material respects. Except as set forth in

any Subsidiary (including any Taxes required to be withheld pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code in connection with the redemption of the Preferred
Stock) have been timely withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental
Authority.  The Company has made adequate provisions to the extent required
by GAAP consistently applied in the consolidated financial statements
included in the Company SEC Documents for the payment of material Taxes for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable with respect to
periods covered thereby that were not yet due and payable as of the dates
thereof. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and each Subsidiary is a member of the same affiliated
group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a)(1) of the Code) for which the
Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return as the common
parent, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been included in any
other consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis Tax Return. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any

defined in Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any
indemnification, allocation or sharing agreement with respect to Taxes that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnification obligation
(other than agreements among the Company and its Subsidiaries and other than
customary Tax indemnifications contained in credit or other commercial
agreements the primary purpose of which does not relate to Taxes). None of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution
occurring during the last

  



        
   

  



  

### five years in which the parties to such distribution treated the
distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code is applicable. Neither

adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law by reason of a change in accounting method. The

of deduction, in a taxable period beginning after the date of Closing as a
result of (i) a change in method of accounting occurring prior to the date of
Closing, (ii) an installment sale or open transaction arising in a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the date of Closing, (iii) a
prepaid amount received, or paid, prior to the date of Closing or (iv)
deferred gains arising prior to the date of Closing. Neither the Company nor

in a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the date of
Closing, (iii) a prepaid amount received, or paid, prior to the date of
Closing, (iv) deferred gains arising prior to the date of Closing, or (v) the
application of Sections 1.1502-13 or 1.1502-19 of the Treasury Regulations

U.S. federal income tax return for 2009 pursuant to Section 1033(a)(2)(A) of
the Code.

  

###

Schedule, (i) no audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings
are pending or being conducted with respect to any material Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received from any Governmental Authority any notice, that has not been

any such location that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
obligation or corrective action under any Environmental Laws or interfere
with operations, (d) each of the Company and each Subsidiary has all permits,
licenses and other authorizations required under any Environmental Law (the

pending or, to the

believe that any Environmental Permit for which it has applied or is
preparing an application will not be granted in the ordinary course, (f) each
of the Company and each Subsidiary is in material compliance with its
Environmental Permits, and (g) the Company has made available to the Parent

Agreement except in each case, for such invalidity, failure to be

to real property (the "Real Property Easements") necessary to conduct their
businesses as conducted on the date hereof, and to the Companys knowledge,

time or both, revocation or termination thereof or would result in
any impairment of the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to
any Real Property Easement, except for such revocations, terminations and
impairments as would not affect the commercial use of the applicable property
for the purposes for which it is being used by the Company or a Subsidiary as

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, the
Company Board may, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, and enter into discussions and negotiations with,

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### a person (and its Representatives) who has made an unsolicited, written,
bona fide proposal or offer, that did not result in a breach of this
Section 6.4, and subject to compliance with this Section 6.4, relating to, or
that is reasonably likely to lead to, a Competing Transaction, and the
Company Board has (i) reasonably determined, in its good faith judgment
(after consulting with its financial advisor), that such proposal or offer
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii)
reasonably determined, in its good faith judgment after consulting with its
outside legal counsel (who may be the Companys regularly engaged outside
legal counsel), that, in light of such proposal or offer, the failure to
furnish such information or enter into discussions would constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) provided written notice
to Parent of its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions with
such person prior to taking any such action and (iv) obtained from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms and conditions not
materially less restrictive of such person to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement and any related agreements shall not include any provision calling
for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party and that the Company
shall promptly make available to the Parent any material non-
public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
furnished to such person which was not previously delivered to Parent or
its Representatives). For purposes of this Section 6.4, the Company Board
may act through the Special Committee, if the Special Committee still exists.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(c) and subject to
Section 8.1(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or

"Change in the Company Recommendation") or approve or recommend, or cause or
permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
obligation with respect to, any Competing Transaction (except for a
confidentiality agreement as provided in Section 6.4(b)).  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) if the Company Board reasonably determines, in its good
faith judgment after consulting with outside legal counsel (who may be the
Companys regularly engaged outside legal counsel), that the failure to make
a Change in the Company Recommendation would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) if, in response to an
unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer relating to a Competing
Transaction, the Company Board reasonably determines pursuant to
Section 6.4(b) that it constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, the Company Board may make a Change in the Company
Recommendation and/or recommend such a Competing Transaction, then the
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) and enter
into a definitive agreement to effect the Competing Transaction, but only (i)
after providing written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and indicating that the
Company Board intends to effect a Change in the Company Recommendation and/or
recommend a Competing Transaction and (ii) if for a five (5) business day
period following the Companys delivery of a Notice of Superior Proposal, the
Company (and causes its financial and legal advisors to) negotiates with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
modification or adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and
following the end of such five (5) business day period, the Company Board or
an authorized committee thereof determines in good faith, taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### by the Parent to the Company in response to the Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice
of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 6.4(c) (provided that references to the five (5) business day period
above shall be deemed to be references to a forty-eight (48) hour period).

  

### 

  

### (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders, if in the
good faith judgement of the Company Board, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure to disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board
and the Company shall not recommend that the stockholders of the Company
tender their shares in connection with any tender offer or exchange offer (or
otherwise approve or recommend any Superior Proposal) unless the requirements
of this Section 6.4 have been satisfied.

  

###

Disclosure Schedule, except as may otherwise be agreed to by the parties
thereto, and the Company or Parent shall pay at the Effective Time to the
applicable officers and employees listed in said Section 6.5(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, any amounts with respect to such agreements
and obligations that are payable by their terms at the Effective Time or
upon consummation of the Merger.

after the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") with at least the types
and levels of employee benefits (including contribution levels) which are
substantially similar in value to those maintained by them from time to time
for similarly-situated employees.  Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to
treat, the service of the Company Employees with the Company or the
Subsidiaries attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service
rendered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate
benefits, including applicability of minimum waiting periods for
participation.  Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to not, treat any Company Employee as a "new"
employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar plan of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for a pre-existing medical condition
(except to the extent so treated under the Companys corresponding plans),
and any deductibles and co-pays paid under any of the Companys or any of the
Subsidiaries health plans for the year of the Effective Time shall be
credited towards deductibles and co-pays for the year of the Effective Time

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such
results.

  

### 

  

### (c) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all obligations which accrued prior to the
Effective Time under the Employee Plans in accordance with the terms thereof.

  

### 

  

### (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained herein shall (1) be treated as an amendment of any particular
Employee Plan, (2) give any third party, including any Company Employee, any
right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement (including this Section
6.5), (3) obligate the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan, program,
policy or arrangement or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee
or (4) limit the Surviving Corporations, Parents or any of their
subsidiaries ability to amend any particular benefit plan, program, policy
or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation or terminate an employee.

  

###

### (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation and Parent,

extent permitted by applicable Law, any person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a

"Indemnified Party" and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such

Effective Time), arising out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she
is or was a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary, or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary as a director or
officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, any agreement or document contemplated hereby or delivered in
connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Whether in any case asserted or arising at or before or after the
Effective Time, the parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. The Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to control the defense of any Claim covered under this
Section 6.6(a).  Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such Claim, from the Surviving
Corporation within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation
from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor and if required by law shall
provide to the Surviving Corporation an undertaking by such Indemnified Party
to repay such advanced expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
6.6(a). The Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
the Company, and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving

Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 6.6(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent except to the extent, if
any, such failure to promptly notify materially prejudices such party.

  

### 

  

### (b) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of the Surviving Corporation with respect to indemnification, advancement or
exculpation of directors, officers and employees may not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the persons who at any time prior
to the Effective Time were identified as prospective indemnities under the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company in respect of actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_
, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the disposition or resolution of
the matter to which such claim relates.

at no expense to the beneficiaries thereof, either cause to be maintained in
effect the policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time or provide substitute policies or
purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in
any case of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing other terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than all such
policies in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time, so long as the annual
premium therefor would not be in excess of 250% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (d) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.6 applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Section 6.6 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving

be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

damages pursuant to Section 8.3(h), then Parent shall reimburse the Company
for all of its Expenses (but not in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate,

### 

  

### (g) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the amounts
payable hereunder are not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the aggrieved party for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and for losses and
damages likely to be incurred or suffered as a result of termination in the
circumstances described in this Section 8.3, which amounts would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Accordingly in the event that a
party shall fail to pay an amount specified under this Section 8.3 when due,
the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by the party entitled thereto, to the
extent such accrued expenses are, in fact, paid (including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 8.3; _provided_ , that such Expenses of
collection and enforcement shall not be subject to the Expense cap set forth
in Section 8.3(c) above, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Payment of the
fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of any
damages incurred in the event of a Willful and Material Breach of this
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (h) Provided that the Company has not received payment of a Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(e), in the event of a termination of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g), the Company may
seek money damages from Parent; provided that Company agrees that the (i) the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, in the
aggregate for all such Company damages shall be limited to $40,000,000
(the "Parent Liability Limitation") and (ii) in no event shall the Company or
its Affiliates or Representatives seek (and the Company shall cause its
controlled Affiliates and Representatives not to seek) any (x) equitable
relief or equitable remedies of any kind whatsoever or (y) money damages or
any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages other than damages in an amount
not in excess of the Parent 

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### Liability Limitation, in each case against or from Parent or Merger Sub
or the former, current or future stockholders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners or assignees of Parent, Merger Sub or Investors
or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited
partner or assignee of any of the foregoing.

  

### 

  

SECTION 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the
adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders, no amendment may be made that
under applicable Law would require further approval of the Stockholders
without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.

  



  

SECTION 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.4 and to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any covenant,
obligation or condition for the benefit of such party contained in this
Agreement. Subject to the proviso of Section 8.4, no extension or waiver by
the Company shall require the approval of the Stockholders. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.  The agreement of Parent
to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Merger Sub
to such extension or waiver. The failure of any party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party of any of
its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of
such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 8.6 _No Recourse_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges and agrees that, other than pursuant to any agreement to
which such person is a party (and subject to any limitations set forth
therein), it shall have no right of recovery against, and no liability shall
attach to, the former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees of the Company or any Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
former, current or future stockholder, director, officer, employee, general
or limited partner, member, manager, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of
the foregoing, or any Representatives of any of the foregoing, arising under,
or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or otherwise relating thereto.

satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the rights granted pursuant to
clause (c) shall be enforceable on

or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed
and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State, without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of law. All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The parties

of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any
party hereto, (b) agree that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined only in such court, (c) agree not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court

or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of such court, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
Merger may not be enforced in or by such court. Each party
hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

more counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, all
of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been executed by

not be entitled to claim that any fact or combination of facts constitutes a
breach of any of the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement if and to the extent that such fact or

  



        
   

  



  

combination of facts has been disclosed in (i) any Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other
Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that
such disclosure is applicable to such other Section or (ii) the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement in sufficient detail to put
a reasonable person on notice of the relevance of the facts or circumstances
so disclosed. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgement, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material, has resulted or is reasonably expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business
or that it would otherwise be appropriate to include any such information.
