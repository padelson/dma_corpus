ARTICLE II

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

(a) Each share of common stock, without par value, of the Company (such
shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b)) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax. As of the Effective Time, all Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without
interest.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each
case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become, in the aggregate, a number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, without par
value, of the Surviving Corporation equal to the number of Shares that are
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) All rights to acquire Shares (contingent or otherwise) described in
Section 2.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration per Share subject to such rights, on the terms described in
Section 2.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit that vests based solely
on the satisfaction of service conditions (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") granted
under any stock option or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement
of the Company (the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which Shares will not have
been fully distributed in connection with the Closing shall be assumed by
Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Each such Company RSU so assumed by Parent shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the same vesting
conditions) as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (i) such Company RSU shall be an award for common stock, no par value,
of Parent (" _Parent Stock_ "), and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Stock
subject to each such assumed award shall be determined by multiplying the
number of Shares underlying such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time by a fraction (the " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ ") (rounded
to the nearest whole share), the numerator of which shall be the Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which shall be the average of the
volume weighted average price per share of Parent Stock on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") over the five consecutive trading days ending on
the second complete trading day preceding the Closing Date.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit that was granted subject
to vesting based on both the achievement of performance goals and the
satisfaction of service conditions (each, a " _Company PRSU_ ") granted under
any Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement. Each such Company PRSU so assumed by Parent shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such
Company PRSU shall be an award for Parent Stock, (ii) the number of shares of
Parent Stock subject to each such assumed award shall be determined by
multiplying the number of Earned Shares , by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole share),where the term " _Earned Shares_ " means
the sum of number of Shares, if any, determined to be earned for any completed
Performance Period (as defined in the applicable Company PRSU award agreement)
as of the Closing Date plus the number of Shares, if any, determined to be
earned for any incomplete Performance Period as of the Closing Date, in each
case, determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company PRSU
award agreement, and (iii) each such assumed award shall continue to vest
based on the holders continuing service to Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent
through the last day of the Company PRSUs Third Performance Period (as
defined in the applicable Company PRSU award agreement). For the avoidance of
doubt, each such assumed Company PRSU award shall be subject to any
limitations set forth in the Company PRSU award agreement, including any cap
on the number of Earned Shares, as adjusted, that may be settled
upon vesting.

 



\- 4 -

    

(c) At the Effective Time, each stock option granted under a Company Equity
Plan, other than, for the avoidance of doubt, stock options granted under the
Company ESPP (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed
by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Each such Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent shall continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting
schedule) as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (i) such Company Stock Option shall be an award for Parent Stock, (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (iii) the exercise price
per share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal
(x) the per share exercise price for the Shares otherwise receivable pursuant
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right granted under a
Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company SAR_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed
by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Each such Company SAR so assumed by Parent shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule)
as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
such Company SAR shall be an award for Parent Stock, (ii) the number of shares
of Parent Stock subject to each such appreciation right shall be determined
by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Company SAR immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (rounded down
to the nearest whole share), and (iii) the exercise price per share of Parent
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share
exercise price for the Shares otherwise receivable pursuant to such Company
SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to each holder of a Company Equity Award assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.2 an appropriate notice setting forth the terms of
such assumption.

 

(f) The Company shall take such actions as may be necessary with respect to
the Companys employee stock purchase plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") to (i)
amend the Company ESPP so that no participant in any offering may increase his
or her payroll deductions at any time following the date of this Agreement;
(ii) cause any offering underway as of the date of this Agreement to be
terminated as of no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Final Exercise Date_ "); (iii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may
be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period (or purchase period, as
applicable), but otherwise treat any such shortened offering period (or
purchase period, as applicable) as a fully effective and completed offering
period (or purchase period, as applicable) for all purposes under the Company
ESPP, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any purchase period that has
not commenced prior to Closing, will be terminated and no purchase of Shares
will be permitted with respect to that

 



\- 5 -

    

 purchase period; (iv) cause each Company ESPP participants Share purchase
right under the Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") outstanding as of
the Final Exercise Date to be exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; and
(v) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, provided,
however, that the termination of the Company ESPP shall be subject to the
consummation of the Merger. The Company shall cause the Company ESPPs new
offerings to be frozen such that no offering will begin on or after the date
of this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Company
shall not amend the Company ESPP or otherwise provide for outstanding options
or purchase rights under the Company ESPP to be treated in any way other than
the treatment set forth in this Section 2.2(f).

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (a) cause to be adopted
such resolutions, and cause such other actions to be taken, as may be
reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.2 and (b)
shall take the actions described in Section 2.2(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(h) Where Parent determines it appropriate for purposes of non-U.S. Law to
vary the treatment of equity compensation from that provided in Section 2.2
with respect to Company Equity Awards (including those held in escrow or as
deferred compensation), Parent may change the treatment to take into account
tax, securities, employment, or other considerations subject to the terms of
the Company Equity Plans or Company ESPP as applicable, with the consent of
the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any vested and
outstanding Company Stock Option or Company SAR held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by any service provider of the Company who has ceased to be a
service provider before such date, shall not be treated in the manner set
forth in Section 2.2(c) or (d), as applicable, but shall instead be converted,
in settlement and cancellation thereof, into the right to receive an amount
equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
subject to each such option or appreciation immediately prior to the Effective
Time less (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Option or Company
SAR, as applicable, in each case subject to withholding as provided in Section
2.6. Any Merger Consideration payable to a former service provider of the
Company in accordance with this section 2.2(j) shall not be paid by the
Paying Agent but shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(j) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3,
or another appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness thereof and maintain current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to shares of Parent Stock issuable with respect to
all Company RSUs, Company PRSUs, Company Stock Options, and Company SARs
assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 2.2.

 



\- 6 -

    

Section 2.3 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the
Companys transfer agent or another bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in
connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger
Consideration to which shareholders of the Company shall become
entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this Article II
owed in respect of Shares represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to
this Article II, except as provided in this Agreement. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Article II.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall direct the Paying Agent to mail, as
promptly as practicable and in any no event no later than five (5) Business
Days following the Closing, to each holder of record of an outstanding
certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ "), and to each
holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by such Person
shall pass, only upon (x) adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal and (y) in the case of Shares represented by Certificates, only
upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably
agree on) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), in each case in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Surrender of any Book-
Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agents customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or each Book-Entry Share so surrendered (subject to deduction for
any required withholding Tax), and the Certificate, if any, so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person
requesting such payment present proper evidence of transfer and,
if applicable, the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered shall have
delivered to the Paying Agent instruments of transfer in such form as the
Paying Agent may require in accordance with its customary procedures for the
transfer for securities represented by book entry and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 



\- 7 -

    

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any interest
thereon.

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided by applicable
Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.3(g), if, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer (or for any other reason) or transfer is sought for Book-
Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash
in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to
Section 2.6), Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be payable to, and shall be the property
of, Parent.

 

(g) At any time following the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have
been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general unsecured
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



\- 8 -

    

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article II.

 

Section 2.4 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. In accordance with Section 60.554(3)
of the Oregon Act, no dissenters rights shall be available to the holders of
Shares in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 2.5 _Certain Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of such capital stock,
shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Section 2.5 shall be construed to permit or authorize any party hereto to
effect any such change that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, any Company Equity Awards or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement any amounts that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.

treat such transactions as a breach of any Contract or as Good Reason under
any such Contract for such individual to end the employment relationship.
Since the Lookback Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
breached or violated any applicable Law concerning employer contributions to
any trade union, housing, unemployment, retirement, bonus and welfare funds

of money damages not in excess of $100,000 individually or $500,000 in the
aggregate and (B) do not impose equitable relief on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or provide for any admission of wrongdoing by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries;

 

(xiii) fail to maintain insurance at levels substantially comparable to levels
existing as of the date of this Agreement (excluding any Company Plans); or

(xiv) authorize or agree to take any of the actions described in Section
5.1(b)(i) through Section 5.1(b)(xiii).

Section 5.2 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the proceeds of
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any
flex provisions applicable thereto), including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein or on other terms
not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent than those
contained in the Debt Financing Commitments (as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Parent) and not in violation of this Section 5.2(a)
(including clauses (A)-(C) below), (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by
Parent, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments or, if executed and
delivered prior to the Closing, in the definitive documentation with respect
thereto that are within its control and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder and pay related fees and expenses in connection therewith as
and when due and payable, (iii) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments in accordance with the terms thereof (except for amendments and
supplements not prohibited by this Section 5.2(a)) until the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments in the event of a breach by any counterparty
thereto. Parent shall have the right from time to time to amend, supplement,
amend and restate or modify the Debt Financing Commitments; _provided_ , that
any such amendment, supplement, amendment and restatement or other
modification shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (A)
add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the
date hereof, (B) except as otherwise set forth herein, reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing Commitments (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing as set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitments) in a manner that would adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or that would
otherwise be expected to delay or impede

 



\- 42 -

    

 the Merger or (C) otherwise be reasonably expected to (1) prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing as set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitments less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend, supplement,
amend and restate, modify or replace the Debt Financing Commitments as in
effect at the date hereof (x) to add or replace lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement or (y) to increase
the amount of Indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments.
For purposes of this Section 5.2, references to " _Debt Financing_ " shall
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments
(including any flex provisions applicable thereto) as permitted to be
amended, supplemented, replaced or modified by this Section 5.2(a) (and, if
applicable, shall include any Alternative Financing used to satisfy the
obligations under this Agreement) and references to " _Debt
Financing Commitments_ " shall include such documents as permitted to be
amended or modified by this Section 5.2(a) (and, if applicable, shall include
any commitments in respect of any Alternative Financing). Parent shall (X)
give the Company prompt notice of any material breach or default by any party
to the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing, in each case
of which Parent has become aware, and any purported termination or repudiation
by any party of the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing,
in each case of which Parent has become aware, or upon receipt of written
notice of any material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to
the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing and (Y) otherwise
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of Parents efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing upon Companys reasonable request. In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments, but alternative facilities are available on terms and conditions
substantially similar to the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange to obtain alternative financing ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the terms of such Alternative Financing do not expand upon the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date as set forth in the Commitment Letter in effect on the date
of this Agreement or otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions)
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, Parent shall have the right to use the net cash proceeds received by
Parent after the date hereof and prior to the Closing from consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including notes) by Parent to reduce
commitments under the Commitment Letter on a dollar-for-dollar basis;
_provided_ , that (w) to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or
mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or the Termination Date as
applicable, (x) such offering or other incurrence of debt does not result in a
breach or default under, or in violation of, the Commitment Letter, (y) the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing committed under the Commitment Letter
following such reduction, together with other cash and cash equivalents
available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid in

 



\- 43 -

    

 connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (z)
Parent promptly notifies the Company of such substitution and reduction. If
commitments under the Commitment Letter have been reduced to zero in
connection with the preceding sentence, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 5.2(b) shall no longer be in effect. Further,
Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of other
debt financings on a dollar-for-dollar basis for all or any portion of the
Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide financing
sources so long as (v) such other debt financing does not result in a breach
or default under, or violation of, the Debt Financing Commitments (to the
extent in effect following such substitution), (w) the aggregate remaining
amount of the Debt Financing, if any, together with other cash and cash
equivalents available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(x) all conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for
such commitment have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of
such financing are, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent to (or more
favorable to Parent than) the conditions precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letter, (y) such substitution would not reasonably be expected to
delay, prevent or make less likely the funding of any remaining portion of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date and (z) prior to funding of any loans
thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing are subject to
restrictions on assignment that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent
to or more favorable to Parent than the corresponding restrictions set forth
in the Commitment Letter. True, correct and complete copies of each amendment
or modification to the Commitment Letter and documents with respect to each
alternative or substitute financing commitment in respect thereof (each, a "
_New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), together with all related fee letters
(solely in the case of the fee letter, with only the fee amounts, dates,
pricing caps, "market flex" and other economic terms redacted, none of which
would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, termination or
availability of the debt financing contemplated thereby) (each, a " _New Fee
Letter_ "), will be promptly provided to the Company (and drafts thereof shall
be made available to the Company prior to any such substitution). In the
event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (ii)
below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall
be deemed to include the Commitment Letter which is not superseded by a New
Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and each New Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect, and (iii) any reference in this Agreement
to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating to the
Commitment Letter that is not superseded by any New Debt Commitment Letter at
the time in question and to each New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then
in effect.

(b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to provide, on a timely basis all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing (provided; that
such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage
or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries), including (i) furnishing the financial information with
respect to the Company described in paragraph 3 of Exhibit C to the Commitment
Letter and such other information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources to consummate the
Debt Financing and customarily included in marketing materials for senior
secured bank lending

 



\- 44 -

    

 transactions (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include (x) any
information customarily delivered by an investment bank or financing arrangers
or (y) any financial information other than the financial information
required pursuant to paragraph 3 of Exhibit C to the Commitment Letter), in
each case in advance of the Marketing Period (all such information in this
clause (i), collectively, the " _Required Information_ "); (ii) furnishing
the report of the Companys independent accountants on the most recently
available audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and obtaining the consent of such accountants to the use of such
report in accordance with the accountants normal custom and practice; (iii)
furnishing such customary financial statements, schedules or other pertinent
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
information reasonably necessary for Parent to produce pro forma financial
information) reasonably requested by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any such Debt Financing, including the Required Information;
(iv) providing reasonable assistance with the preparation of business
projections, customary financing documents and customary offering materials in
connection with the Debt Financing; (v) providing customary documents
and certificates, and taking other actions reasonably requested by Parent
that are customary in connection with the Debt Financing (including (A)
arranging for customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of
discharge to be delivered at the Closing providing for the payoff, discharge
and termination on the Closing Date of all Indebtedness contemplated by any
such financing to be paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date,
(B) to the extent required by the Debt Financing, facilitating the pledging
of collateral; provided, that no pledge shall be operative until the Effective
Time, (C) using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents, surveys and title
insurance required by the Debt Financing, and (D) consulting with Parent in
connection with the negotiation of such definitive financing documents and
agreements and such other customary documents as may be reasonably requested
by Parent); (vi) providing assistance in the preparation of (but not
preparing) (A) one or more confidential information memoranda and other
customary marketing and syndication materials reasonably requested by Parent
or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Debt Financing and (B)
customary pro forma financial statements reflecting the Merger and the Debt
Financing; (vii) cooperating with the marketing efforts for any portion of the
Debt Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in
ensuring that the syndication efforts benefit from the existing banking
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (viii) permitting the
reasonable use by Parent and its Affiliates of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos for syndication and underwriting, as applicable, of the
Debt Financing, provided, that such logos (x) are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks, and (y) are used solely in
connection with a description of the Merger and the Debt Financing; (ix)
participating as necessary in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
customary one-on-one sessions that are requested at least two Business Days in
advance and road shows with prospective lenders and investors and in drafting
sessions and due diligence sessions, as applicable (including the reasonable
participation in such meetings by the Companys senior management), in each
case, in connection with the Debt Financing; (x) reasonably cooperating
with any financing sources or prospective financing sources (including
arrangers, lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents) for
the Debt Financing (together with the arrangers and the partners,
shareholders, managers, members, directors, attorneys, officers, employees,
advisors, accountants, consultants, agents, Affiliates and Representatives and

 



\- 45 -

    

 successors of any of the foregoing, collectively, the " _Financing Sources_
") and their respective agents due diligence, including providing access to
documentation reasonably requested by any such Person in connection with the
Debt Financing (including sufficient access to allow any Financing Source to
complete field exams and inventory appraisals); (xi) assisting in preparing
customary rating agency presentations and participating in a reasonable
number of sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing;
and (xii) as long as such information is requested by the Financing Sources in
writing at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, providing to the
Financing Sources, at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering Laws, including the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001, as amended and the beneficial ownership regulations under 31 C.F.R.
Section 1010.230; provided, that (w) nothing in this Section 5.2(b)
shall require the Company to provide (1) any financial statements other than
the financial statements required pursuant to paragraph 3 of Exhibit C to the
Commitment Letter, (2) any information not reasonably available to the Company
and its Subsidiaries under its current internal control and reporting systems
or (3) pro forma financial statements and/or projections, including pro forma
cost savings, synergies, capitalization or other post-Closing pro forma
adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma financial
information (but in each case without limiting the assistance required to be
provided by the Company pursuant to clauses (iv) and (vi) above), (x) none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with any such financing except for any payment that is conditioned
upon, and shall not take effect until, the Effective Time, and (y)
no obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Contract,
certificate, document or instrument delivered pursuant to this Section 5.2
shall be required to be effective until the Effective Time. The Company will
provide to Parent and the Financing Sources such information (including any
updates to the Required Information) as may be necessary so that the marketing
materials for any such financing are true and correct in all material respects
and do not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements are
made, not materially misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
solely for purposes of Section 6.3(b), the Company will be deemed to have
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
5.2(b) if, in the event Parent were to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof,
the lenders with respect to the Debt Financing would (without further
conditions) be obligated under the terms of the Commitment Letter to fully
fund the Debt Financing at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary, (i) in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.2, none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be required to (A)
pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any other
liability in connection with any financing prior to the Effective Time, (B)
give any indemnities that are effective prior to the Effective Time, (C)
provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted
under any Law applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries or that is legally

 to the Company or its Subsidiaries or would result in a violation of, or
default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party (provided that in each case the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to eliminate any such impediment) and (ii) Parent shall
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in good faith in connection
with fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.2. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective Representatives) from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses actually suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the arrangement of any such financing and any information used in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in writing for use
in the Debt Financing documents), except in the event such loss or damage
arises out of or results from the gross negligence, fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct of any of its obligations hereunder by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives. No person who is a director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing shall be required to pass any
resolutions or consents to approve the Debt Financing.

 

Section 5.3 _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or
its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations. This Section 5.3 shall
in no way limit any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date,
if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its
terms, and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 5.4,
the Company agrees that it will not and, will not authorize or permit any of
its or its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including
by providing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to,
or the making or completion of, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal (including (A) approving any transaction under any
Takeover Restriction, (B) approving any Person becoming an "interested
shareholder" as defined in Section 60.825 of Oregon Act or a "Related Person"
as defined in the Company Charter or (C) granting any amendment, waiver
or release of any standstill or similar Contract with respect to the Company
or any Shares);

 



\- 47 -

    

(ii) engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions (other than to
state that they are not permitted to have discussions) concerning, or provide
or cause to be provided any information or data relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal;

(iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (or propose to
do so); or

(iv) except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant
to and in compliance with the terms of Section 5.4(b), execute or enter into
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal;

_provided_ , _however_ , in each case, it is understood and agreed that any
determination or action by the Company Board expressly permitted under
Section 5.4(b), Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e), Section 5.4(h) or Section
7.1(c)(ii) shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.4(a). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4(a) by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4(a) by
the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a), but subject
to the requirements of the remainder of this Section 5.4, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company may, in response to
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the date
hereof that did not result from a breach in any material respect of Section
5.4(a) and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel and its independent financial advisor, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and such Persons Representatives (including
sources of financing if applicable) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Company than, the Confidentiality Agreement (except (x) for such changes
specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement and (y) such agreements shall not be required
to contain any standstill or similar provisions) (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Subject to the actions expressly permitted by Section 7.1(c)(ii) (on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein) and Section 5.4(d) and
Section 5.4(e) below, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, its recommendation that the shareholders of the Company approve
this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting or (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal (any of such actions, an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

 



\- 48 -

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, the Company
Board or any committee thereof may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Superior Proposal only if:

 

(i) the Company Board (or the applicable committee thereof) has received a
written Acquisition Proposal after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto that did not result from a breach in any
material respect of Section 5.4(a) and determines, after consultation with
outside counsel and its independent financial advisor, that (w) such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (x) such Superior Proposal is
outstanding, (y) the failure of the Company Board (or such committee) to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties and (z) the
Company Board (or such committee) intends to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Superior Proposal (which determination, and any
public announcement thereof permitted under Section 5.4(h), shall not in and
of itself constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change);

(ii) the Company has provided written notice to Parent at least four Business
Day prior to the making of such Adverse Recommendation Change (an " _Adverse
Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent of the determination contemplated by
the foregoing clause (i) of this Section 5.4(d), including that the Company
Board or such committee intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change (and
the manner and timing in which it intends to do so) (such four Business Day
period, the " _Notice Period_ "), which Adverse Recommendation Notice the
Company shall deliver no more than 24 hours following such determination;

 

(iii) the Company provides Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent requests or initiates such
negotiation) with respect thereto during the Notice Period, in each case as
would enable the Company Board or such committee to determine that a Superior
Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal;

(iv) the Company complies in all material respects with the requirements of
Section 5.4(g) in respect of such Superior Proposal; and

(v) Parent does not, at or prior to the end of the Notice Period, make an
offer or proposal in writing (which, if accepted by the Company, would be
binding on Parent) that the Company Board or such committee determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial
advisor) to be at least as favorable to the Companys shareholders as such
Superior Proposal.

Any change to the financial terms or any material change to the other terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new Notice Period and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.4(d) with respect to each such Adverse
Recommendation Notice;  _provided_ , that each such new Notice Period shall
be shortened to three Business Days following the receipt of the corresponding
new Adverse Recommendation Notice.

 



\- 49 -

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, the Company
Board or any committee thereof may, prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event only if:

 

(i) the Company Board or such committee has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial advisor,
that, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties;

 

(ii) the Company has provided written notice to Parent at least four Business
Days prior to the making of such Adverse Recommendation Change advising
Parent that the Company Board or such committee intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable
detail; and

 

(iii) during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company has engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement so that the Company Board or such committee no longer determines
that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties.

 

(f) So long as this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with its
terms, no Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board, including in any respect
that would have the effect of causing any Takeover Restriction to be
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the
Merger. Nothing in Section 5.4(d) shall be deemed to permit the Company to
take any action described in Section 5.4(a)(iv) and enter into a definitive
agreement providing for a Superior Proposal unless the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) and pays the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.3.

(g) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after
becoming aware of the items set forth in (i)-(iii)) shall provide notice to
Parent of (i) any receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests
for information that would not reasonably be expected to be related to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or
negotiation regarding, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal, including in each case the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and a description of
the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. The
Company shall (A) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and details
(including any change to the material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, (B) contemporaneously with providing any non-public
information (including any correspondence or other written material) to a
third party in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, to the extent not previously provided to Parent, furnish a complete
and accurate copy of such information (including information provided by
electronic mail) to Parent, and (C) provide to Parent as soon as practicable
(and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof complete
and accurate copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Representatives, including those
provided by electronic mail, from any third party in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company agrees that it
shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any Contract
that prohibits or restricts it from providing to Parent the information
contemplated by, or otherwise complying with, this Section 5.4(g), Section
5.4(c), Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e).

 



\- 50 -

    

(h) Subject to the proviso to this sentence, nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or Schedule 14D-9 or (ii) making any required
disclosure to the Companys shareholders, including any "stop, look and
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) or any other similar statement
in response to any publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of
the foregoing clause (i) or clause (ii), in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose
such information would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company,
the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board take, or agree to
take, any action prohibited by Section 5.4(c), except as expressly permitted
by Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e).

 

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall instruct their
Representatives to, cease immediately all existing
communications, discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall request the prompt return or destruction of all
copies of all nonpublic data and information it or its Subsidiaries and its
and their Representatives have distributed prior to the date of this Agreement
to each other potential purchaser that has executed a confidentiality

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
(and, in any event, not later than the 15th Business Day immediately
thereafter), the Company shall (i) prepare (with Parents reasonable
cooperation to the extent required) and file with the SEC a proxy statement
(as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to
be sent to the shareholders of the Company relating to the special meeting of
the Companys shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") to be
held to consider the approval of this Agreement and (ii) set a record date
for the Company Shareholders Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to
Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. No filing or
mailing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and the Company shall include all additional disclosures and
corrections (and shall consider in good faith all other comments) reasonably
proposed in a timely manner by Parent with respect thereto). The Company will
advise Parent promptly after it receives any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments on the Proxy
Statement and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide Parent with complete and accurate
copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the responses
thereto. The Company shall respond to any requests or comments from the SEC as
promptly as practicable and will provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (and the Company shall include all additional
disclosures and corrections (and shall consider in good faith all other
comments) reasonably proposed in a timely manner by Parent in such any 

 



\- 52 -

    

 response). The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
shareholders of the Company on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after
the resolution of any comments thereon from the SEC or, if the SEC does not
inform the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before
the 10th calendar day following the filing of the Proxy Statement, on or
prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following such 10th calendar day. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this
Section 5.5(a) to comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of Law. If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder
Meeting, any information should be discovered by the Company or Parent that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
so that the Proxy Statement would not contain any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall promptly be filed by the Company with the
SEC and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated by the
Company to shareholders of the Company;  _provided_ , that the delivery of
such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party
hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

(b) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms,
and notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e), as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the resolution of any comments on the Proxy Statement from the SEC
(or, if the SEC does not inform the Company that it intends to review the
Proxy Statement on or before the 10th calendar day following the filing of the
Proxy Statement, as promptly as reasonably practicable following such 10th
calendar day), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and, if applicable, the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith. The Company Shareholders Meeting shall be held not later than the
30th calendar day immediately following the date of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement absent any legal restraint that prevents such action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (after consultation with Parent and
outside counsel) may or (if requested by Parent) shall adjourn or postpone
the Company Shareholders Meeting if (i) the Company or Parent reasonably
determines that the Company Shareholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at
the Company Shareholders Meeting (including due to an absence of quorum),
(ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholder
Meeting by applicable law or by order or a request from the SEC or its staff,
(iii) the Company Board reasonably determines that it would be necessary or
advisable for any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement to
be provided to the Companys shareholders sufficiently in advance of the
Company Shareholder Meeting for the Company Shareholders to evaluate or
consider such supplement or amendment (including in connection with an
Adverse Recommendation Change), or (iv) if as of the time for which the
Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) or thereafter re-scheduled in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, there are insufficient affirmative votes for the shareholders
of the Company to duly approve this Agreement; _provided_ that, the Company
Shareholder Meeting will not be postponed or adjourned without the mutual
agreement of Parent and the Company (A) by more than 10

 



\- 53 -

    

 calendar days at a time or, with respect to any postponement or adjournment
contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) or (iv), more than three times in
the aggregate; (B) with respect to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)(iv)_, by more than
30 calendar days after the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting was
(or was required to be) originally scheduled; or (C) to a date that is fewer
than ten Business Days prior to the Termination Date. In no event will the
record date of the Company Shareholder Meeting be changed without Parents
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), unless required by
applicable Law.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms
and except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.4(d) or 5.4(e), the
Company, through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend to the shareholders of
the Company that they approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1 and, to the extent required under the terms of this
Agreement, the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 7.3, the Companys obligations pursuant to Section 5.5(b) and this
Section 5.5(c) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other Person of any
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to Section 5.4(d) and Section 5.4(e), the
Company shall (x) solicit from the shareholders of the Company proxies in
favor of the approval of this Agreement and, if applicable, the advisory vote
required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith, and
(y) use reasonable best efforts to secure the vote of the shareholders of the
Company required by the Company Charter, the rules of NASDAQ or the Oregon Act
to obtain such approvals.

Section 5.6  _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, upon reasonable prior written
notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, managers, employees and representatives to,
afford to Parent reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent
with applicable Law, to the respective officers, employees, properties,
offices, other facilities and books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent shall reasonably request in writing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, other than
to the extent required by Section 5.4(g), neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any Contract with any third
party in effect on the date hereof, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize
the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or (iii) otherwise
violate any applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide such access or disclose such information in
a manner that would not result in any of the consequences referred to in any
of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). Any access to any Company
properties or facilities shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security
measures and the applicable requirements of the Real Property Leases and shall
not include the right to perform any "invasive" testing or soil, air or
groundwater sampling, including, without limitation, any Phase I or Phase II
environmental assessments.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 2, 2018, between Parent and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality

except that the Company hereby waives the Standstill Provisions (as defined
therein), which shall cease to be of any further force or effect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to (i) disclose nonpublic
or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Financing Sources, and to rating agencies and prospective
lenders and investors during syndication of any financing subject to their
entering into customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such
information (including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily
used in confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities), and
(ii) publicly disclose, including by filing or furnishing one or more Current
Reports on Form 8-K, the Required Information and pro forma financial
information provided to any Financing Source under any confidential

prepared in connection with any financing sought or obtained by Parent in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries will be required, in connection with the foregoing, to grant or
offer to grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or
make any payment, to any Person in connection with seeking or obtaining any
such consent, waiver or approval and (B) for the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, and the
Company may not and may not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the
prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to or offer or
agree to any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or
order to (1) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or

 otherwise dispose of any material assets or business, or any capital stock,
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Subsidiary of any of
the foregoing or (2) impose any material restriction, requirement or

the transactions contemplated hereunder without first providing the other
party with a true, correct and complete copy of such notification in draft

Section 5.8 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
may have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, (i) for the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the earlier of December 31, 2019 (the " _Benefits
Transition Date_ ") or the date employment ceases, to maintain for each
Company Employee employed as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") base salary levels no less favorable than that in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) for the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the earlier of the Benefits Transition Date or
the date employment ceases, to maintain for each Continuing Employee other
cash compensation levels (such term to consist of percentage of salary used
for target bonus opportunities (on metrics set by Parent) and
commission programs) no less favorable than those in effect as of the date
hereof, and (iii) for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
six (6) months after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Company to
maintain in effect the Severance Practices (as defined and described in
Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule). Any other Company Plans
and benefits not specifically described in this Section 5.8 will be provided
in the sole discretion of Parent. 

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide or cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide Continuing
Employees full credit for the Continuing Employees service with the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, and benefit accruals under Parents 401(k) plan, vacation accrual
rates, sick time accrual rates, service used for determining severance under
the applicable policy or Contract, and any pre-Closing Date Company Equity
Awards that are assumed by Parent to the same extent recognized by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such
service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

 

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
maintain in place, from the Effective Time through the Benefits Transition
Date, the pre-Closing Company Plans that provide medical, dental, vision,
employee assistance, short-term disability and long-term disability benefits.
Such coverage for the Continuing Employees will transition to Parent-provided
benefit plans effective on the day after the Benefits Transition Date. From
and after the Benefits Transition Date, Parent will or will cause its
Subsidiaries to cause any 

 



\- 57 -

    

 pre-existing conditions or limitations, exclusions, eligibility waiting
periods and required physical examinations under any group health and welfare
plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents. To the extent that the Benefits
Transition Date occurs other than on the last day of the plan year with
respect to any welfare benefit plans, Parent shall recognize or cause to be
recognized the dollar amount of all co-payments, co-insurance, out of pocket
expenses, deductibles, offsets and similar payments incurred by each
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents during the plan year in
which the Benefits Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying such
years co-payment, co-insurance, out of pocket, deductible, offset or similar
payments under the corresponding plan of the Parent or its Subsidiaries in
which the Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) will
be eligible to participate from and after the Benefits Transition Date.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent or any of its Affiliates and a Continuing Employee or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the applicable individual written
Contract, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to honor in accordance
with its terms, (i) each existing written employment, retention, change in
control, severance and termination Contract of or between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company,
(ii) all written obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any
equity-based, bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or Contracts of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (iii) all vested and accrued benefits under
any Company Plans or Contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(e) Upon Parents written request, which request shall be made at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall adopt resolutions, no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, such resolutions having been approved
as to form by the Parent at least two (2) Business Days before such action is
taken. In addition, upon Parents written request, which request shall be
made at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions, no earlier than thirty (30)
days prior to the Closing Date, to terminate the Companys
Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the rules set forth in Treas.
Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix).

 

(f) This Section 5.8 shall not apply with respect to individuals covered by
collective bargaining agreements or other collective representations, in
which case the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement or
collective representation shall apply, or with respect to individuals or
Company Plans subject to non-United States Law, in which case Parent agrees
to comply or cause its Subsidiaries to comply with any applicable Laws or
employment Contracts with respect to compensation and benefits. Section 5.8 is
included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not create any right
in any Person, including any current or former director, officer, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant in
any Company Plan or any dependent, beneficiary or trustee thereof. Nothing
contained in this Agreement (express or implied) (i) is intended to require
Parent or the Company or its Subsidiaries to establish or maintain any
specific employee benefit plan for any length of time (except as set forth
Section 5.8(d)), (ii) is intended to create a Company Plan or any Employee
Benefit Plan or amend any of

 



\- 58 -

    

 the foregoing, (iii) is intended to confer upon any individual any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time, or any right to a
particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) shall be construed to
indicate the existence of employment relations between the Company or any of
its Affiliates and any of its or their service providers (including
contractors and consultants). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the parties do not intend for this Section 5.8 to create any
rights or obligations except between the parties hereto. No Continuing
Employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other Person not a party to this
Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates under this Section 5.8.

 

Section 5.9 _Takeover_ _Restrictions_. If any Takeover Restriction is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company, the Company Board and, to the
extent required, Parent, shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Restriction on
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the date hereof until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII
and the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify each
other of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any Action commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the
conditions to the other partys obligation to consummate the Merger set forth
in Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

 

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any present
(as of the Effective Time) or former officer, director or employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided
in the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries disclosed in Section 5.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective
terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.11.

 



\- 59 -

    

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy,"
in either case of at least the same coverage and containing terms and
conditions that are substantially equivalent with such policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with
respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual
premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained
pursuant hereto (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), but in such case shall purchase
as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_
_further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and
the coverage thereunder costs more than the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be
obtained for the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on
terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby, for an amount not to exceed the Maximum Premium. If such tail prepaid
policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, (i)
Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) no party shall have any obligation to purchase
or maintain any other insurance pursuant to this Section 5.11.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.

(d) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if any party fails promptly to pay any
amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the owed party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the owing party for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, the owing party
shall pay to the owed party its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 from the date such

such payment was required to be made.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Subject to the proviso to Section
7.2, the payment, when due and paid, by the Company to Parent of the
Termination Fee and, to the extent applicable, any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Merger Sub in the event of the termination of this Agreement under the
circumstances requiring the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(a). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Parent actually receives the
Termination Fee (and, to the extent applicable, any other amounts payable
under this Section 7.3), the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or
Merger Sub that Parent or Merger Sub may be otherwise entitled to pursue
under this Section 7.3, and in such case neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding or make any claim against the
Company or any of its Representatives arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the
proviso to Section 7.2.

Section 7.4  _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval by the shareholders that previously rendered such approval
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the
amendment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Section 7.4 and Sections 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.13 and 8.17 (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of any such Section)
may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that materially
and adversely affects the Financing Sources without the prior written consent
of the Financing Sources materially and adversely affected thereby.

Section 7.5  _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant
hereto or (c) subject 

 



\- 67 -

    

 to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
of the other parties contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that
pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval by the shareholders that
previously rendered such approval without such further approval. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power.

warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent and Shareholder hereby agree as follows:

(b) " _Shares_ " means (i) all shares of capital stock of the Company owned,
beneficially or of record, by Shareholder as of the date hereof, and (ii) all

Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
Section 2(a) shall not prohibit a Transfer of the Shares by Shareholder (i) to

company, all partners or members of which include only the Persons named in

to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and expiring on the Expiration Date, except for this
Agreement and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Shareholder shall not

(a) Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of the shareholders of the
Company called concerning proposals related to the Merger Agreement or the
other transactions contemplated thereby, and at every adjournment or
postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of
the shareholders of the Company concerning proposals related to the Merger
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated thereby, Shareholder (in

the Shares to be present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum and, to

Agreement and the approval of the other transactions contemplated thereby
(collectively, the " _Proposed Transaction_ "), (ii) against the approval or
adoption of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with, the
Proposed Transaction, and (iii) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other
action that could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay,
postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the Proposed
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Shareholder to vote or otherwise consent to any amendment to the
Merger Agreement or the taking of any action that would result in the
amendment, modification or a waiver of a provision therein, in any such case,
in a manner that decreases the amount or changes the form of the
Merger Consideration. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 3(a),
Shareholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or
abstaining with respect to any other matter presented to the shareholders of
the Company.

 

(b) If Shareholder is the beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of any
of the Shares, Shareholder agrees to take all actions necessary to cause the
record holder and any nominees to vote all of the Shares in accordance with
Section 3(a).

authority, for and in the name, place and stead of Shareholder, to vote the
Shares, to instruct nominees or record holders to vote the Shares, or grant

aggregate, has not and would not prevent Shareholder from performing
Shareholders obligations under this Agreement.

7\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect whatsoever as of the earlier of (a) such date and time as the Merger
Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to the terms of Article
VII thereof or (b) the Effective Time (the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided,
however,_ that (i) Section 8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement,

prepaid, and shall be effective upon dispatch when correctly addressed to the

description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice
of a special meeting will include a description of the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called.

business at the meeting, and (b) consideration of a particular matter at the
meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting
notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is

Section 2.5. Quorum and Adjournment

 

2.5.1 Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a
matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to
that matter. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or
by applicable law, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter will constitute
a quorum for action on that matter.

2.5.2 A majority of shares represented at a meeting, although less than a

2.6.3 Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or by
applicable law, if a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the

entitled to vote in the election.

Section 2.7. Action Without a Meeting

 

2.7.1 Action required or permitted by law to be taken at a shareholders
meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by shareholders
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
take such action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote on
the action were present and voted. The action will be evidenced by one or
more written consents describing the action taken, signed by those
shareholders taking action under this Section 2.7, and delivered to the
Corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.
Action taken under this Section 2.7 is effective when the consent or consents
bearing sufficient signatures are delivered to the Corporation, unless the
consent or consents specify an earlier or later effective date. If not
otherwise determined by law, the record date for determining shareholders
entitled to take action without a meeting under this Section 2.7 is the date
the first shareholder signs the consent. A consent signed under this Section
2.7 has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any
document.

2.7.2 If action is taken in accordance with this Section 2.7, the Corporation
must give written notice of the action promptly after the action is taken to:
(a) shareholders not entitled to vote, if the Oregon Business Corporation Act
would require that notice of the proposed action be given to such nonvoting
shareholders if this action had been submitted to a vote of shareholders at a
meeting, and (b) shareholders entitled to vote who did not consent in writing
under this Section 2.7. The notice must contain or be accompanied by the same
material that would have been required under the Oregon Business Corporation
Act to be sent to such shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the
proposed action would have been submitted to a vote of shareholders. The
notice is effective when mailed if it is mailed postage prepaid and is
correctly addressed to the shareholders address shown in the Corporations
current record of shareholders.

Section 3.9. Quorum and Vote

 

3.9.1 A majority of the directors in office immediately before a meeting
begins will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A majority
of the directors present, in the absence of a quorum, may adjourn from time to
time but may not transact any business.

 

3.9.2 If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a
majority of directors present is the act of the Board of Directors. If, at
any meeting in which a quorum is present, the number of votes cast by
directors in favor of any action are equal to the number of votes cast by
directors opposed to such action, then the Chair of Board will have the power
to decide if the action is approved and taken by the Board of Directors.

3.9.3 A director of the Corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board
of Directors, or is present at a meeting of a committee of the Board of
Directors, when corporate action is taken, is deemed to have assented to the
action taken unless (a) the director objects at the beginning of the meeting,
or promptly upon the directors arrival, to holding the meeting or
transacting business at the meeting; (b) the directors dissent or abstention
from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (c) the
director delivers written notice of dissent or abstention to the presiding
officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the Corporation
immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right of dissent or
abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action
taken.

Section 3.10. Telephonic Meetings

 

The Board of Directors may permit any or all directors to participate in a
regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through, use of any
means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously
hear each other during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by
this means will be deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

 

Section 3.11. Action Taken Without a Meeting

 

Except as otherwise provided by these Bylaws, action required or permitted by
law to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or at a meeting of a
committee of the Board of Directors, may be taken without a meeting if the
action is taken by all members of the Board of Directors. The action will be
evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed
by each director and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate
records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 3.11 is
effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent
specifies an earlier or later effective date. A consent signed under this
Section 3.11 has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in
any document.

any person who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other
(including an action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the
Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Corporation or a fiduciary within the meaning of

entitled to indemnification under this Article. No amendment to these Bylaws

exclusive of any other provisions for indemnification or advancement of
