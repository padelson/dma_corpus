economic terms redacted, none of which would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, termination or availability of the Debt Financing) (collectively, the &#147;<U>Fee Letter</U>&#148;). As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Debt
Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, and the respective commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded and, to the knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated
as of the date of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties

There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or without

assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section&nbsp;6.1 and Section&nbsp;6.3, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be satisfied by it and contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Debt Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained
in Section&nbsp;6.1 and Section&nbsp;6.3 and that the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub will have, at the Effective Time, sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources
of immediately available funds to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II, and to pay all related fees and expenses. In no event shall the
