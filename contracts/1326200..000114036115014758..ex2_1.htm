 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER_

  

  

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any securities of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

  

  

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Class B Stock then owned by
the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the
Company\'s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  

  

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Class B Stock then owned by
Parent, Merger Sub, or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

  

  

(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 3.1(a)_ and
subject to _Sections 3.1(b)_ and _3.1(c)_ , each share of Company Common Stock
then outstanding shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
0.216 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), which Parent Common Stock shall be duly authorized
and validly issued in accordance with applicable Laws and the Parent Charter,
fully paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive rights; and

  

  

    

(iv) each share of the capital stock, no par value, of Merger Sub then
outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Entity.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and subject to
_Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ , _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_ , and _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_ , if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
recapitalization, or other similar transaction or event, or there occurs a
record date with respect to any of the foregoing, then the Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted.

  

  

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder), in lieu of such
fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Shares, shall receive cash (without interest) from
the Exchange Agent in an amount representing such holder\'s proportionate
interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of
all such holders of Company Common Stock which would otherwise be issued if
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock were issuable in the Merger by Parent
(the " _Excess Company Common Stock_ "). The sale of the Excess Company Common
Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE, through one or more
member firms of the NYSE, and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders (the " _Fractional
Shares Trust_ "). Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer Taxes and other
out-of-pocket transaction costs incurred in connection with such sale of the
Excess Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of
the Fractional Shares Trust to which each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate
net proceeds comprising the Fractional Shares Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of fractional interests to which such holder
of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled and the denominator of which is
the aggregate amount of fractional interests to which all holders of shares of
Company Common Stock are entitled. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares
of Company Common Stock in lieu of fractional shares, the Exchange Agent shall
make available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Any such sale shall be made within ten Business Days or such shorter period as
may be required by applicable Law after the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) It is intended by the Parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The Parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.

  

  

Section 3.2 _Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time:
(a) all holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the

  

  

    

Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company
other than the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in
lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with
_Section 3.1(c)_ ) as contemplated by _Section 3.1_ and (b) the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Class B Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Class B Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common
Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Entity or
Parent, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in _Section 3.3_.

  

  

Section 3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange agent in the Merger
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Parent shall issue and cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent (by instruction to Parent\'s transfer agent), promptly
after the Effective Time, certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (or make appropriate
alternative arrangements if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by a book entry will be issued), including the shares covered by
_Section 3.1(c)_. The shares of Parent Common Stock so deposited with the
Exchange Agent are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  

  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Common Stock (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares
in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock (or appropriate
alternative arrangements if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by a book entry will be issued), any unpaid dividends and
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time, and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_. Exchange of any Book Entry
Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agent\'s customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share to the Exchange
Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or
Parent, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or uncertificated shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by a book entry) that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.1_ (and cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with
_Section 3.1(c)_ ). The Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.3_ , each Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be
deemed, from and

  

  

    

after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive shares of
Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock payable in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ ) as contemplated by
_Section 3.1_ and this _Section 3.3_. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate
representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit of
loss and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Exchange Agent, Parent, or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Company
Stock Certificate.

  

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has
the right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders such Company
Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.3_
(at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of
applicable escheat law or similar Law, to receive all such dividends and
distributions, without interest).

  

  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Fractional Shares Trust that
remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares as of the date one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.3_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for satisfaction of their claims
for Parent Common Stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock, in each case without
interest thereon.

  

  

(e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and the Surviving Entity shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or any provision of United States state or local Tax
Law or non-United States Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. The right
to deduct and withhold any consideration shall include the right to sell or
otherwise dispose of any such consideration to satisfy any requirement of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be (i) paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, and (ii) treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid;
_provided_ , that any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement that is retained and sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant
to this _Section 3.3(e)_ shall be treated as having been transferred to the
Person entitled to receive such payment pursuant to this clause (ii) and then
as having been transferred to the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Entity, as applicable, followed by a sale or other disposition of such
property by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable,
on behalf of the recipient.

  

  

    

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any
of them, shall be liable to any holder or former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any
cash amounts, properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders, their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto or any other Person.

  

  

Section 3.4 _Equity Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Incentive
Plan) will adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the following:

  

  

(i) at the Effective Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested and automatically
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; and

  

  

(ii) make such other changes to the Company Incentive Plan as may be
necessary, proper, desirable or advisable to give effect to the Merger.

  

  

Section 3.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary, desirable or proper to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Entity with full right, title, and
possession of and to all undertakings, properties, assets, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Entity and Parent shall be fully authorized (in

January 1, 2013 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Filings_ "). Each Company
SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or,

officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company\'s
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report

to the Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange
Act, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company\'s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those Entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Company\'s principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in the Company\'s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange
Act).

standing under the Laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and has the
requisite organizational power and authority to own or use its properties and

is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned or used by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

being conducted. Each Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the

  

  

    

properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its business makes

failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) As of the date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries are the beneficial
owners and/or record owners of 6,356,471 shares of Company Class B Stock.

  

  

Section 5.2 _Authority_.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite organizational power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

Section 5.6 _SEC Filings_.

  

 

  

    

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.6(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
Parent has filed on a timely basis with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, including any
amendments or supplements thereto, from and after January 1, 2013
(collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC Filing, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and (ii)
did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of
registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any other Subsidiary of
Parent is separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act. As used in this _Section 5.6_ , the term "file" shall be broadly
construed to include any manner in which a document or information is filed,
furnished, transmitted, supplied, or otherwise made available to the SEC.

  

  

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent\'s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent\'s
auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Parent\'s internal controls.
Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required to be
included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries (for this purpose, including the Company and its Subsidiaries),
is made known to Parent\'s principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those Entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent\'s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required
to be included in the Company\'s periodic reports filed with the SEC. Since
the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive
officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange
Act).

  

  

(c) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject
of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings since January 1, 2013 which
remain unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request from
the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent which has not been adequately
addressed. None of the Parent SEC Filings, as of the date hereof, is the
subject of any confidential treatment request by Parent.

applicable), including the related notes and schedules, complied with the
rules and regulations of the SEC as of the date of filing of such Parent SEC
Filings, was prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated and each such consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations, shareholders\' equity and cash flows of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the
omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S‑X promulgated by the
SEC). The consolidated balance sheet included in Parent\'s most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K is referred to herein as the " _Parent Balance Sheet_."

  

  

(b) None of Parent or its consolidated Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, determined,
determinable or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i)
reflected or reserved against in the Parent Balance Sheet (including in the
notes thereto), (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet or (iii) that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time such document
is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is amended or supplemented or
at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy

the time of the Parent Shareholder Meeting, at the time the Form S-4 is
declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. All documents that
Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, to the extent relating to Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or other information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent for inclusion therein, will comply as to form, in
all material respects, with the provisions of the Securities Act or Exchange
Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and
each such document required to be filed with any Governmental Authority (other
than the SEC) will comply in all material respects with the provisions of any
applicable Law as to the information required to be contained therein.

  

  

    

(b) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 5.8_ will

or less prior notice). None of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of
Parent has any liability for any prohibited transaction or accumulated funding
deficiency (within the meaning of Section 431 of the Code) or any complete or
partial withdrawal liability with respect to any pension, profit sharing or
other plan which is subject to ERISA, which in each case has had or would

conducted, (iii) the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as
it is currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate the Intellectual Property rights of any Third Party, (iv) there are no
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened claims, in writing, with
respect to any of the Intellectual Property rights owned by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries and (v) to the knowledge of Parent, no Third Party is
currently infringing or misappropriating Intellectual Property owned by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent and its Subsidiaries are taking all actions
that they reasonably believe are necessary to maintain and protect each
material item of Intellectual Property that they own.

  

  

Section 5.16 _Property_. Parent and its Subsidiaries have good, valid and, in
the case of real property, marketable title to, or valid leasehold or sublease
interests or other comparable Contract rights in or relating to, all of the
real property and other tangible assets used in or necessary for the conduct
of their business as currently conducted, including good and valid title to
all real property and other tangible assets reflected in the latest audited
financial statements included in the Parent SEC Filings as being owned by
Parent and its Subsidiaries or acquired after the date thereof (other than
property sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of

  

  

    

business since the date thereof), free and clear of all Liens except for
Permitted Liens and Liens that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are collectively the lessee of all
property material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries which is
purported to be leased by Parent and its Subsidiaries and are in possession of
such properties, and each lease for such property is valid and in full force
and effect without default thereunder by the lessee or the lessor, except in
each case as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all items of equipment and
other tangible assets owned by or leased to Parent and its Subsidiaries are
sufficient for the uses to which they are being put, are in good and safe
condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted), and are sufficient for
the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries in the manner in
which such business is currently being conducted and is proposed to be
conducted. Section 5.16 of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists all material
real property and any material interest in real property owned by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 5.17 _Vessels; Maritime Matters_.

  

  

(a) Section 5.17(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a list of all
vessels owned as of the date hereof by Parent or its Subsidiaries (the "
_Parent Owned Vessels_ ") or chartered-in as of the date hereof by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Leased Vessels_ "), including the name,
registered owner, capacity (gross tonnage or deadweight tonnage, as specified
therein), year built, classification society, official number, flag state, and
whether such Parent Vessel is currently operating in the spot market or time
chartered market, of each Parent Owned Vessel and Parent Leased Vessel. Each
Parent Vessel is operated in compliance with all applicable Maritime
Guidelines and Laws, except where such failure to be in compliance would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent or its applicable Subsidiary is
qualified to own and operate the Parent Owned Vessels under applicable Laws,
including the Laws of each Parent Owned Vessel's flag state, except where such
failure to be qualified would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
Parent Vessel is seaworthy and in good operating condition, has all national
and international operating and trading certificates and endorsements, each of
which is valid, that are required for the operation of such Parent Vessel in
the trades and geographic areas in which it is operated, except where such
failure would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Each Parent Vessel is classed by a classification society which is a
member of the International Association of Classification Societies and is
materially in class with all class and trading certificates valid through the
date of this Agreement and, to the knowledge of Parent, (i) no event has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause such Parent Vessel's class
to be suspended or withdrawn and (ii) is free of average damage affecting its
class.

  

  

(c) With respect to each of the Parent Owned Vessels, as of the date hereof,
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, is the sole owner of each
such Parent Owned Vessel and has good title to such Parent Owned Vessel, free
and clear of all Liens other than

  

  

    

Permitted Liens and Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.18 _Taxes_.

  

  

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into
account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and all
such Tax Returns were complete and correct, subject in each case to such
exceptions as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries has duly paid (or there has been paid on their
behalf), or made adequate provisions for, all material Taxes required to be
paid by them.

  

  

(b) (i) There are no audits or other Actions pending with regard to any
material Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) no
deficiency for Taxes of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been claimed,

any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled, except
for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect
to which the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year and (iv)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of United States state or local income Tax Law or non-United
States income Tax Law).

  

  

(c) Since its inception, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than (i) in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice or (ii) transfer or

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects, with
all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446
and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any foreign Laws) and have
duly and timely withheld and have paid over to the appropriate taxing
authorities all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on
or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

  

  

(e) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been established.

  

  

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested, has received or
is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Authority or has entered
into any written agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any

respect to or involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and after the

Subsidiaries shall be bound by any such Tax allocation or sharing Contracts or
similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(h) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a

successor, by Contract, or otherwise.

which any of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not file a Tax Return that
such relevant entity is subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has had a permanent establishment in any
country other than the country of its organization.

  

  

(k) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects
with the intercompany transfer pricing provisions of each applicable Law
relating to Taxes, including the contemporaneous documentation and disclosure
requirements thereunder.

  

  

(l) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or has any
intention to take any action, either before or after the Closing, which could
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

  

Section 5.19 _Insurance_. Parent and its Subsidiaries are covered by valid and
currently effective insurance policies issued in favor of Parent (the "
_Parent Insurance Policies_ ") that are adequate and otherwise customary for
companies of similar size and financial condition. To the knowledge of Parent,
the Parent Insurance Policies are valid and enforceable and are in full force
and effect and no misrepresentations were made in connection with the
applications for such policies. Except for those matters that have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all
premiums due thereon have been paid, and Parent and its Subsidiaries have
otherwise complied with the terms and conditions of such policies. Except for
those matters that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, there is no claim for coverage by Parent or
any or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of the Parent Insurance
Policies that has been denied or disputed by the insurer. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from or on behalf of
any insurance carrier issuing policies or binders relating to or covering

stock of Parent that are necessary to approve the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

each of its Subsidiaries, respectively.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent covenants and agrees that, during
the Interim Period, except as may be agreed in writing by the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or as may

Section 6.3 _Access to Information_. During the Interim Period, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the Representatives of the other, upon prior notice during normal

(taken as a whole) or Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), as the

testing), books, Contracts and records and, during the Interim Period, each of
the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to) make available to the other, upon the other's reasonable
request, such other information concerning its business and properties as the
other Party may reasonably request from time to time. Neither the Company nor
Parent (nor any of their respective Subsidiaries) shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would, in
the opinion of the Company's or Parent's outside counsel (as the case may be),
jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law
(it being agreed that the Parties shall make reasonable and appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply). In addition, the Company shall
facilitate any meetings or discussions with Third Parties with whom the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a material contractual relationship
that requires such Third Party's consent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or that could reasonably be expected to
materially restrict the business or operations of Parent or the Surviving
Entity following the Effective Time, in each case, as reasonably requested by
Parent. No investigation on the part of Parent, the Company or their
respective Representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of
the other contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies

notify the other in writing of any event, condition, fact, or circumstance
that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ impossible or unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received by
such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any Actions commenced or, to the knowledge of
such Party, threatened against, relating to or involving such Party or any of

Merger, the Voting and Support Agreement or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent's prior written consent, unless such settlement
involves only the payment of money and the amount of such settlement shall be
fully covered by insurance proceeds (other than any retainer amount). Parent
shall give the Company the opportunity to reasonably participate in the
defense and settlement of any shareholder litigation against Parent and/or its
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the Company's prior written
consent, unless such settlement involves only the payment of money and the
amount of such settlement shall be fully covered by insurance proceeds (other
than any retainer amount).

covenants, or obligations of any Party contained in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.5 _Registration Statement; Joint Proxy Statement_ _; Shareholder
Meetings_.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, (i) the
Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement and (ii) the Company and Parent shall prepare, and
Parent shall cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4, which will include
the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep
the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
Affiliates and the holders of its capital stock to the other and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement. The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement shall include all
information reasonably requested by a Party to be

  

  

    

included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement,
and shall provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to the
Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the other an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order
relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each
of the Company and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its respective shareholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any other
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified) reasonably required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign securities Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in the Merger and the Charter Amendment, and the Company shall furnish
all information concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

  

  

(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any Party becomes aware of any
event or circumstance which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, it shall promptly inform
the other Parties.

  

  

(c) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Laws to
call, give notice of, and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Class B Stock for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval and the Company Unaffiliated Shareholder Approval (the "
_Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") and shall not submit any other proposal to
such holders in connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting (other than a
proposal relating to executive compensation as may be required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, and any customary procedural proposals),
without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company Shareholder Meeting
shall be held (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent)
as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Unless a Change in Company Recommendation has occurred in
accordance with _Section 6.6_ , each of the Company and the Company Board
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Company Shareholders
the Company Shareholder Approval and the Company Unaffiliated Shareholder
Approval. The Company covenants that, unless a Change in Company
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section 6.6_ , (i) the Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to the Company Shareholders

  

  

    

adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.5(c)_ , if, on a
date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Class B Stock to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval and the Company Unaffiliated Shareholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholder Meeting;
_provided_ , that the Company Shareholder Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the
Company Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) without Parent's
prior written consent. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
relieve the Company of its obligation to submit the Merger to the Company
Shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof. The Company agrees that,
unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with _Section
8.1_ , its obligations to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting pursuant to
this _Section 6.5(c)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal or by any Change in Company Recommendation.

  

  

(d) Parent shall take all action necessary under all applicable Laws to call,
give notice of, and hold a meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval and the Charter
Amendment Approval (the " _Parent Shareholder Meeting_ ") and shall not submit
any other proposal to such holders in connection with the Parent Shareholder
Meeting (other than a proposal relating to executive compensation as may be
required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act, and any customary
procedural proposals), without the prior written consent of the Company. The
Parent Shareholder Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by Parent in
consultation with the Company) as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Unless a Change in Parent
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section 6.6(b)(v)_ , each of
Parent and the Parent Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from the Parent Shareholders the Parent Shareholder Approval and the Charter
Amendment Approval. Parent covenants that, unless a Change in Parent
Recommendation has occurred in accordance with _Section 6.6(b)(v)_ , Parent
shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to the Parent Shareholders adoption
and approval of this Agreement, approval of the Merger and approval of the
Charter Amendment and further covenants that the Joint Proxy Statement shall
include the Parent Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.5(d)_ , if, on a date for which the Parent
Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Parent Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ , that the Parent Shareholder Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the
date for which the Parent Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law)
without the Company's prior written consent. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the
Merger and the Charter Amendment to the Parent Shareholders for a vote on the
approval thereof. Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , its obligations to hold the
Parent

  

  

    

Shareholder Meeting pursuant to this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall not be affected by
any Change in Parent Recommendation.

  

  

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

  

  

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
cause its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to, or a
transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets (including shares or other ownership interests of its
Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, the Company's voting
securities that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or the
shareholders or other equity interest holders of such Person) beneficially
owning securities representing 20% or more of the Company's total voting power
(or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or the voting power of
any of its Significant Subsidiaries, but excluding in each case any Company
Vessel Sale (any such proposal, offer or transaction (other than a proposal or
offer made by a Party to this Agreement) being hereinafter referred to as an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions with or provide
any confidential information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
(including the Company Special Committee) shall be permitted, prior to the
Company Shareholder Meeting to be held pursuant to _Section 6.5_ , and subject
to compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.6_ and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any
nonpublic information or data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such Person first made after the
date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.6_ ) and which the Company Board concludes in good faith (acting through the
Company Special Committee, if then in existence, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the
Company Board concludes in good faith (acting through the Company Special
Committee, if then in existence, and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of

  

  

    

any written nonpublic information or data provided to a third party pursuant
to the prior sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such
information to such third party.

  

  

(ii) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 36
hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person
that informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from any Person
seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed
in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions
of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing
and any related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also
promptly, and in any event within 36 hours, notify Parent, orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any Person
in accordance with this _Section 6.6(b)_ and keep Parent informed of the
status and material terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all written
material documentation or correspondence relating thereto.

  

  

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 6.6(b)(iv)_ or _Section 6.6(b)(v)_ ,
neither the Company Board, the Parent Board, nor any committee thereof shall
withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the other Parties, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the
other Parties, the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, or any such committee
thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Charter Amendment (a " _Change in Company
Recommendation_ " or a " _Change in Parent Recommendation_ ," respectively).

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board (acting through the Company
Special Committee, if then in existence) may make a Change in Company
Recommendation if and only if (A) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.6_ ) is made to
the Company by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn,
(B) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (acting through the Company
Special Committee, if then in existence, and after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company Board has concluded in good
faith (acting through the Company Special Committee, if then in existence, and
after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, (D) three Business Days
shall have elapsed since the Company has given written notice to Parent
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the
material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action, and shall include a copy of such Superior Proposal, a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements, if any, and a copy of
any written financing commitments relating thereto and a written summary

  

  

    

of the material terms of any Superior Proposal not made in writing, including
with respect to any financing commitments relating thereto (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment to any
material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Recommendation Change and a new three-Business Day period), (E) during such
three-Business Day period, the Company has considered and, at the reasonable
request of Parent, engaged in good faith discussions with Parent regarding,
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and (F) the Company Board, following such three-Business Day period,
again determines in good faith (acting through the Company Special Committee,
if then in existence, and after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  

  

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent
Board or (in circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition
Proposal) the Company Board (acting through the Company Special Committee, if
then in existence), may make a Change in Parent Recommendation or a Change in
Company Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) a material fact,
event, change, development or set of circumstances has occurred or arisen
after the date of this Agreement (and, in connection with a Change in Company
Recommendation, such fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances
does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company), (B) the
Board of Directors of the Party proposing to take such action have first
determined in good faith (acting through the Company Special Committee, if
then in existence, in the case of the Company, and in each case after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, (C) three Business Days
shall have elapsed since the Party proposing to take such action has given
written notice to the other Parties advising that the notifying Party intends
to take such action, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, (D) during such three-Business Day period, the notifying
Party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other Parties,
engaged in good faith discussions with such Parties regarding, any adjustment
or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Parties
and (E) the Board of Directors of the Party proposing to take such action,
following such three-Business Day period, again determines in good faith
(acting through the Company Special Committee, if then in existence, in the
case of the Company, and in each case after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Parties) that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its respective duties under applicable Law.

  

  

(vi) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6_ shall prohibit any Party or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under

  

  

    

any other provision of this Agreement, including _Section 8.1(c)_ or _Section
8.1(d)_ , as applicable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure
that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, with
respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal received by the Company
shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation or Change in Parent
Recommendation, as applicable, unless the Company Board or the Parent Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its respective
recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of
the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, without disclosing any
Change in Company Recommendation or Change in Parent Recommendation, as
applicable.

  

  

(c) The Company agrees that it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its
and their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly inform
its and its Subsidiaries' respective Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this _Section 6.6_.

  

  

(d) Subject to _Section 8.1(e)_ , nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall be
interpreted as (i) creating a right of the Company or Parent to terminate this
Agreement or (ii) affecting any other obligation of the Company or Parent
under this Agreement. The Company shall not submit to the vote of the Company
Shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes in good faith, acting through the Company Special Committee and
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and
after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of the proposal and the Person making the proposal (including any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions and any conditions to and expected
timing of consummation), (i) is more favorable from a financial point of view
to the Company Unaffiliated Shareholders than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (taking into account any revised proposal by the Parent Board
on behalf of Parent) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being consummated
without undue delay; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this definition of
"Superior Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in _Section 6.6(a)_ , except that the reference to "20%
or more" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to
refer to a transaction involving the Company.

  

  

Section 6.7 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.5_ ), each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to) use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
pursuant to

  

  

    

any Contract to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including those contemplated by _Section 7.2_ ) and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the defending of any Actions challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Authority vacated or
reversed, the avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust,
merger control, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to Third Parties, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Parent in its efforts, to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by
_Section 6.7(a)_ that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and costs
incurred in connection with the Company's obligations under this _Section
6.7(b)_. Each of the Parties will furnish to the other Parties such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other Parties may request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions with a Governmental Authority and will cooperate in responding to
any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the
other Parties of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other Party with copies of all material correspondence, filings or
communications between any Party and any Governmental Authority with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent
practicable, and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each Party shall
permit Representatives of the other Parties to participate in meetings
(whether by telephone or in person) with such Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any
Third Party pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall not be considered a
condition to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger.

  

  

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be obtained, and
to cooperate with the Company in obtaining, as promptly as practicable, all
consents and waivers required under the Company Funded Debt (or the Contracts
related thereto) so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger) do not cause any event of default pursuant to, or
otherwise violate or contravene, the terms of the Company Funded Debt (or any
Contract related thereto) (the " _Debt Waivers_ "). Parent agrees to provide
such security

  

  

    

and assurances as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness of
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time as may
be reasonably requested by any Person from whom a Debt Waiver is required in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limitation to the foregoing, except as provided in Section
6.7(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent shall execute and deliver such
amendments, guarantees, indemnities and other agreements and documents, pledge
such collateral, provide such information, participate in such meetings,
assist in the preparation of such documents and agreements, make and cooperate
in the making of such filings, and take such other action, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, as shall be reasonably necessary or
appropriate in connection with the Debt Waivers (and obtaining the same);
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor Parent shall be
obligated to incur any out of pocket fees, costs and expenses in connection
with the Debt Waivers (and obtaining the same). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Debt Waivers (and
obtaining the same).

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger (including the Debt
Waivers, for purposes of clause (ii) only), (i) without the prior written
consent of Parent, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' Representatives, shall pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation to such Person and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay or commit to pay any amount, to waive
any right or benefit, incur any obligation unless in each such case it is
conditioned on completion of the Merger, make any accommodation or otherwise
take any action in connection with obtaining any such approval or consent. To
the extent consistent with applicable Law, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to accommodations that may be requested or
appropriate to obtain such consents.

  

  

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The Parties shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements or filings with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the
Parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public filing
prior to obtaining the other Parties' consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If for any reason it is not
practicable to consult with the other Parties before making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, then the Party making such statement shall not make a
statement that is inconsistent with public statements or filings to which the
other Parties had previously consented.

  

  

Section 6.9 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the

  

  

    

Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as provided under the Company
Articles of Incorporation, Company By-Laws or the Company's indemnification
Contracts or undertakings, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of
six years (or, in the event that any Action is pending or asserted during such
six-year period, until the final disposition of such Action, if after
expiration of such six-year period).

  

  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time (or, in the event that any Action
is pending or asserted during such six-year period, until the final
disposition of such Action, if after expiration of such six-year period), to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Person for any documented,
out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Person in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are
incurred, subject to Parent and the Surviving Entity's receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified
Person is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity will be liable for
any settlement effected without the prior written consent of Parent and the
Surviving Entity (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(c) The Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity
to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time,
if available, the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(provided that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies, of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date hereof) or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Entity be required to expend
an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Entity will obtain, and Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to
obtain, that amount of directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage)
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the

  

  

    

Company shall be permitted to purchase any such "tail" insurance policy prior
to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this _Section
6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated

Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons to
whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this

to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.9_. The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Person is entitled,

intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and

prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to

information necessary for Parent and Merger Sub to take the actions
contemplated by this _Section 6.11_ , the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each
shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that
(a) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities
related to such stock) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Parent
Common Stock (including derivative securities related to such stock) resulting
from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who may become subject to the reporting requirements of

Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.13 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote, and shall cause each of
its controlled Affiliates to vote, all shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Class B Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its controlled
Affiliates in favor of adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger. Parent agrees not to, and to cause each of its controlled
Affiliates that own Company Common Stock or Company Class B Stock not to,
sell, dispose, hypothecate, pledge, assign or otherwise transfer any shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Class B Stock. The Company shall vote all
shares of Parent Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the record date for the Parent Shareholder Meeting in favor
of adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
Charter Amendment.

  

  

Section 6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger, the Voting and
Support Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective board of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Takeover Statute inapplicable to the foregoing.

  

  

Section 6.15 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date
(to be effective as of the Effective Time) the resignation of each director of

than five days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.16 _Parent Board of Directors_. Subject to receipt of the Charter
Amendment Approval, Parent shall take all necessary action to cause, as of the
Effective Time, the Parent Board to be increased to eight directors and to

to be added to the Parent Board to serve on the Parent Board at least until
the annual meeting of the Parent Shareholders to be held in 2016. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that receipt of the Charter Amendment Approval is not a
condition to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and that, if the Charter Amendment
Approval is not obtained, Parent shall have no obligation to increase the size
of the Parent Board or to add any individual to the Parent Board.

  

  

Section 6.17 _Compliance with Management Agreement_. Parent agrees that during
the Interim Period, Parent shall comply with its obligations, covenants and
other agreements under the Management Agreement (unless instructed otherwise
in writing by the Company Special Committee), and shall not take any action in
its capacity as Manager under the Management Agreement (unless instructed in
writing by the Company Special Committee) that would constitute a breach or
violation of the Management Agreement or that would be reasonably expected to
cause the Company to breach any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder.

  

  

    

Section 6.18 _Gain Recognition Agreement_. Parent and Surviving Entity
covenant and agree to provide any information reasonably requested by a
Company Shareholder that has entered into a gain recognition agreement with
the IRS pursuant to section 1.367(a)-3(b)(1)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations
with respect to the Merger and has notified Parent in writing that it has
entered into such agreement, in order to comply with such Company
Shareholder's gain recognition agreement filing requirements under section
1.367(a)-8 of the Treasury Regulations. Parent and Surviving Entity covenant
and agree to inform any Company Shareholder of the occurrence of any events
that may affect any such Company Shareholder's gain recognition agreement,
including triggering events or other gain recognition events, as provided in
section 1.367(a)-8(c)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations.

  

  

Section 6.19 _Tax-Free Reorganization_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Surviving Entity shall, and they shall not permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, take any action prior to or following the
Effective Time that would disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate

(ii) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or

_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a Party if the issuance of such

result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure to be
satisfied of the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
or _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ , as the case may be, and (ii) cannot

Company Unaffiliated Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a
vote taken thereon at the duly convened Company Shareholder Meeting;

  

  

(g) by the Company or Parent, if the Parent Shareholder Approval shall not

obligations of any Party shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (a) no such
termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages (which the
Parties agree shall be determined by the courts referred to in _Section 9.11_
and, to the extent proven, with due regard to _Section 9.7_ , shall not
necessarily be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs)
resulting from or arising out of fraud or any willful and material breach of
this Agreement and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 8.2_ ,
_Section 8.3_ , _Article IX_ and the definitions of all defined terms
appearing in such sections shall survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (and no such termination shall relieve any Party of
any liability arising under _Section 8.3_ of this Agreement). If this
Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and
other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable,
shall be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority or other Person to which
they were made.

  

  

    

Section 8.3 _Expenses_.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_ or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, commences an Action that results in a judgment against the other Party for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , such paying Party
shall pay the other Party its documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees of counsel) in connection with such Action,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of 5% for the period
from the date such payment was originally required to be made through the date
such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing body
or entity or committees thereof) at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, Company Unaffiliated Shareholder Approval and
Parent Shareholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after any such shareholder approval of this Agreement, there
shall not be any amendment of this Agreement that by applicable Law requires
further approval or authorization by the Company Shareholders or Parent
Shareholders without such further approval or authorization. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf
of each of the Parties.

  

  

    

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to

valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or
Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law
as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case
of agreements and instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. References to a person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to
currency of the United States of America.

  

  

    

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof
and (c) all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other Parties (except to the
Surviving Entity). Any assignment in violation of the preceding sentence shall
be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Letter, Parent Disclosure Letter, exhibits, annexes and appendices
hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except for the
provisions of _Section 6.9_ , and, as applicable, the right of the Company, on
behalf of the Company Unaffiliated Shareholders, to seek damages in accordance
with _Section 8.2_ in the event of Parent's or Merger Sub's fraud or willful
and material breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that it is
acknowledged and agreed that neither this provision nor any other provision in
this Agreement is intended to provide the Company Shareholders (or any Person
not a party hereto acting on their behalf) the ability to seek (whether in its
capacity as a shareholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or
otherwise) on behalf of the Company) the enforcement of, or directly seek any
remedies pursuant to, this Agreement, or otherwise create any rights in the
Company Shareholders under this Agreement or otherwise, including against the
Company or its directors, under any theory of law or equity, including under
the applicable Laws of agency or the Laws relating to the rights and
obligations of third-party beneficiaries. For the avoidance of doubt as to the
Parties' intent, the determination of whether and how to terminate, amend,
make any waiver or consent under, or enforce this Agreement, and whether and
how (if applicable) to distribute any damages award to its shareholders, shall
exclusively belong to the Company in its sole discretion. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and

  

  

    

warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section
8.5_ without notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the Parties. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

  

  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or
by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be deemed to be made in and
in all respects will be interpreted, construed and governed by and in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice of Law or conflict of Law provision that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York, except to the
extent that the Laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are mandatorily
applicable to the Merger.

  

  

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

  

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of New York and to the jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the State of New York, for the purpose of any Action
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each
Party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such Action may
be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state or federal court.

  

  

    

(b) Each Party hereby (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process in any other Action relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party and
nothing in this _Section 9.11_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any United States federal court located
in the State of New York or any New York state court in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any
United States federal court located in the State of New York or any New York
state court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

  

  

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.12_.
