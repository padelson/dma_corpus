SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall file a certificate
of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions

 



2  of the DGCL, and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL

merger. The time the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ".

 

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall

of the Company and Merger Sub shall be the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. (a) At the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub shall be amended so that
it reads in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit C_ hereto, and, as so

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub shall be amended so that they

amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or held by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



3 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each other share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become exchangeable for 0.2016
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Parent Common Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any other amounts, if any, to
be paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to fully reflect the
appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, or any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock or Parent Common
Stock having a record date occurring on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
adjustment shall be made with respect to the Spin-Off.

 

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. (a) At the
Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the 2006/2007 Stock Incentive and
Compensation Plan, the 2007/2008 Stock Incentive and Compensation Plan, the
2008/2009 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan or the 2011/2012 Stock
Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested)
shall be deemed fully vested and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right
to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax, with cash being paid in lieu of
issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) with a value equal to the
_product_ of (i) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration Closing Value
over the exercise price per share under such Company Stock Option and (ii) the
number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , _however_
, that (A) if the exercise price per share of any such Company Stock Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Closing Value, such Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled without any payment being made in respect
thereof, and (B) at the option of Parent, in lieu of paying all or a portion
of the amounts due to a holder of Company Stock Options under this paragraph
in shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent may substitute for such shares an
equivalent amount in cash. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued to holders of Company Stock Options shall
be deemed to have a value equal to the closing price of Parent Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange on the first trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date. Promptly following the Closing Date (and, in any event,
within ten Business Days thereof), Parent shall (1) if any shares of Parent
Common Stock are being issued to any holder of Company Stock Options, cause
Parents

 



4  transfer agent to issue such Parent Common Stock, and (2) if any cash
payments are being made to any holder of Company Stock Options, cause the
Company to process such payments through its payroll system.

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that, as of the
Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans and any agreements thereunder and any
other equity-based compensation or benefit plans (collectively, the " _Company
Equity Plans_ ") shall be terminated, and all Company Stock Options and all
other equity-based awards shall be cancelled at the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option or other equity-based
award or any participant in any Company Equity Plan shall have any rights to
acquire the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries, or any other rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the payments (if any) contemplated by this Section.

 

SECTION 2.3 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for Merger
Consideration.

(b)  _Deposit_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock, shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in an amount
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to this
Article. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, when and as needed, cash in an amount sufficient to pay any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to paragraph (h) below and cash in an amount
sufficient for payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to paragraph (i)
below. All shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent
shall deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration and
Parent shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange
Agent in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be the property of and paid to Parent.

(c) _Certificated Shares_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than five Business Days following the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of
record of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") representing shares of Company
Common Stock as of the Effective Time which such shares of Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates
by the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably
agree, including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Each holder of a Certificate that has been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
such Certificate, together with a properly completed

 



5  letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any) that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this Article and (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares in the amount (if any) that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to paragraph (i) below.

 

(d) _Uncertificated Shares_. Each holder of uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, without the submission of any letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any)
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article and (ii)
cash in lieu of fractional shares in the amount (if any) that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to paragraph (i) below. Promptly after the
Effective Time, and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and deliver to each
holder of Book-Entry Shares such consideration.

(e) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or
distributions payable to former holders of Company Common Stock. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to paragraph (h) below and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to paragraph (i) below.

 

(f) _Other Payees_. If payment (whether in cash or Parent Common Stock) is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent and the
Exchange Agent that such tax is not applicable.

(g) _No Further Transfers_. The Merger Consideration and other amounts payable
pursuant to this Article shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in, this Article.

(h) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the
holder of any Company

 



6  Common Stock until such Company Common Stock is exchanged as provided in
this Section. Following such exchange, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax
or other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of such Parent Common Stock (i) at the time of such exchange, all
dividends and other distributions, if any, payable in respect of any such
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and
a payment date on or prior to the date of such exchange and not previously
paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other
distributions, if any, payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such exchange.

(i) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in exchange of Company Common Stock, no dividends
or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive (taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
held at the Effective Time by such holder and rounded to five decimal places)
pursuant to Section 2.1 by (ii) the closing price of Parent Common Stock on
the New York Stock Exchange on the first trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

 

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of the Company Common Stock underlying such lost instrument as
contemplated by this Article.

(k) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock six months
after the Closing Date shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with this Article prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders
shares of Company Common Stock as a general creditor thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



7 SECTION 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE III

Except as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent contemporaneously with
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the

the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the

to outstanding Company Stock Options).

 



8 (b) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares
reserved for issuance will be, when issued, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right or
subscription right, nor issued in violation of any provision of the DGCL, the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or any Contract to which the Company is a
party or is otherwise bound.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any
Indebtedness having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders
of the Company or such Subsidiary on any matter.

 

(d) Except as (i) set forth in paragraph (a) above, (ii) for capital stock of
Subsidiaries of the Company owned by the Company or another wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) for changes since the close of business

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or rights or interests described in
the preceding clause (C), or (E) obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or

(e) There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts, investor agreements,
proxies or other Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or of which the Company has Knowledge with respect to the holding,
voting, registration, redemption, repurchase, transfer or other disposition of
any capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Section 3.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of the close of business on the Measurement

outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Award, the name of the plan under which

price, vesting schedule and expiration thereof, and whether (and to what
extent) the vesting of such Company Stock Award will be accelerated or

9  will be triggered or otherwise adjusted in any way by the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
termination of employment or engagement or change in position of any holder
thereof following or in connection with the Merger. Each Company Stock Option
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Code was qualified at the time it was issued. The exercise price of each
Company Stock Option was no less than the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock as of the applicable date of grant of such Company Stock Option,
as determined pursuant to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and

including the cancellation of all Company Stock Options at the Effective
Time, the cash out of in-the-money Company Stock Options at the spread value
thereof and the payment of no consideration with respect to out-of-the-money

Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise bound. Except for the capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any equity, membership interest, partnership
interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or voting interest in, or
any interest convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for any of the
foregoing, nor is it under any current or prospective obligation to form or
participate in, provide funds to, make any loan, capital contribution,
guarantee, credit enhancement or other investment in, or assume any liability
or obligation of, any Person. All outstanding shares of capital stock and
other voting securities or equity interests of each such Subsidiary are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, charges, options, rights of first refusal, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any limitation
on voting, sale, transfer or other disposition or exercise of any other
attribute of ownership) (collectively, " _Liens_ ").

corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

10  delivered by each of the Company and SpinCo and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company and SpinCo, enforceable against
the Company and SpinCo in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity).

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
directors of the Company were present, duly and unanimously adopted

delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of the Company and SpinCo
does not, and the consummation of the Merger, the Spin-Off and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company and SpinCo
with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation
or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties
or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or give rise to
any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements
under, or require any consent, waiver or approval of any Person pursuant to,
any provision of:

 

(i) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of any Subsidiary of the
Company;

(ii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
paragraph (b) below, any Law applicable to the Company or any of its

merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the
DGCL, (iv) the filing of a listing application and associated documentation
with respect to SpinCo with the NYSE MKT, the Toronto Stock Exchange or, with

by the Company, and (v) such other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and notices the failure
of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No filing or other action is required of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the " _HSR Act_ ") or the Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Canadian Antitrust

Laws, do not exceed CDN$82 million.

transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event). None of the Company Plans or any other plan agreement or
arrangement in effect immediately prior to the Closing could result separately

this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) in the
payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code.

up, make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any of its

4999 of the Code)) or interest or penalty related thereto.

liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under applicable
Environmental Laws; (iv) since December 31, 2012 through the date hereof,

rationale underlying a claim for Taxes has been asserted previously by any
Governmental Entity that reasonably could be expected to be asserted in any
other period. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any closing agreement or offer in compromise with any Governmental
Entity.

 

(g) There are no Tax Liens on the properties of the Company or any of its

prior to the Closing Date. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action that could defer a liability for Taxes from any taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date.

(k) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any
"reportable transaction" for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b) or Section 6111 of the Code or any analogous provisions of state
or local Law. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its
federal Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a
substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section
6662 of the Code.

agent or representative (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate,

to, or the making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the

and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations (if any)
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or potential Acquisition Proposal, (B) request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished (and shut

Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not
terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any
such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, (1) the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Acquisition
Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section, (3) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (4)
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (I) or
(II) below would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware
Law, then the Company may (I) furnish information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making

 



39  such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing a standstill provision and other terms that are at least as
favorable to the Company as those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that any non-public information provided to any such Person shall
have been previously provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior
to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (II)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub) the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
Merger, the Spin-Off or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any
such actions (each such action set forth in this paragraph (b)(i), an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, binding term sheet or other Contract
(excluding a confidentiality agreement described in clause (I) of
paragraph (a) above) (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or propose to take any
such actions. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to
do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law,
taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Parent pursuant to this Section, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal unless:

 

(i) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five Business Days before
taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy
(if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any
other relevant transaction documents; and

(ii) if Parent makes a proposal during such five Business Day period to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after taking
into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law.

 



40 During the five Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change as referred to above, the Company shall negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) above, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
of receipt) advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any indication by any Person that
it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or request
for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead
to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any proposal or
offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case together with a description of the material terms and conditions of
and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or
offer, the identity of the Person making any such indication, inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written agreement or other
materials provided by such Person. The Company shall keep Parent informed
(orally and in writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of the
status and details (including, within 24 hours after the occurrence of any
amendment, modification, development, discussion or negotiation) of any such
indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, including furnishing copies
of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written
summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting any
of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above and shall in
no event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions
or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

 

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement as of the date hereof.

 

(f) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions of
any Anti-Takeover Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply to
such Person, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e2(a), Rule 14d9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation MA promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such

 



41  disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys
stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such
disclosure.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization, consolidation,
tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A) assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that generate (or would
reasonably be expected to generate, if in operation) 15% or more of the net
revenues or net income or that represent 15% or more of the total assets
(based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (B) 15% or more of any class
of capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any resulting parent company of the Company, in each
case other than the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited bona fide binding written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and
the Person making the proposal, including the financing terms thereof, is (A)
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of
view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in
response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of being completed on the
terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal", references in the term "Acquisition
Proposal" to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to "75%".

SECTION 5.3 _Recommendation of the Stock Issuance by the Parent Board_.
Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw (or modify
or qualify in any manner adverse to the Company) (a) the adoption, approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Parent Board or any such

material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or that is otherwise required under the Securities Act to be
included therein, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders
of the Company; _provided_ that the delivery of such notice and the filing of

exchange as reasonably determined by the Company) prior to consummation of
the Spin-Off.

obligations in Section 5.8, each of SpinCo and the Company shall use its

notice to or procure the consent of any third Person that is entitled to
notice, or whose consent to assignment (or waiver thereof) is required, in
connection with the consummation of the Spin-Off. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor SpinCo shall be required in connection with
obtaining the consent of any third 

 



47  Person that is not a Governmental Entity to agree to (i) the payment of any
consideration (monetary or otherwise) to such third Person, (ii) the

shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 8.8, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in

action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party
waives its rights under this Section with respect thereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

SECTION 8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

determine, the transfer, assignment or assumption by the SpinCo Group of such
Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be, shall be

Transferred Asset_ " and any such Assumed Liability, a " _Delayed
Assumed Liability_ "), then, insofar as reasonably possible and subject to

similar position as if such Delayed Transferred Asset or Delayed Assumed
Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated hereby and

Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability, as the case may be, including use, risk
of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such

pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, are obtained or made, and (ii) any other legal
impediments for the transfer, assignment or assumption of any such Delayed
Transferred Asset or Delayed Assumed Liability have been removed, then the
transfer, assignment, or assumption of such Delayed Transferred Asset or
Delayed Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall be effected in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(d) _Delayed Retained Transfers_. If and to the extent that the valid,
complete and perfected transfer, assignment or assumption by the RemainCo
Group of any Retained Asset or any Retained Liability, as the case may be,

that has not been obtained or made by the Effective Time then, unless the
Parties mutually otherwise determine, the transfer, assignment or assumption
by the RemainCo Group of such Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities, as the
case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported

Assets and Retained Liabilities under the indemnification obligations set
forth in _Article IV_.

Liability, as the case may be, intended to be transferred, assigned or assumed
hereunder , is not consummated on or prior to the Effective Time whether as a
result of the provisions of _Section 2.4(d)_ or for any other reason

 



18  (any such Retained Asset, a " _Delayed Retained Asset_ " and any such
Retained Liability, a " _Delayed Retained Liability_ "), then, insofar as
reasonably possible, the member of the SpinCo Group retaining such Delayed
Retained Asset or such Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may be, shall
thereafter hold such Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability, as
the case may be, for the use and benefit of the member of the RemainCo Group
entitled thereto (at the expense of the member of the RemainCo Group entitled
thereto). In addition, the member of the SpinCo Group retaining such Delayed
Retained Asset or such Delayed Retained Liability shall, insofar as
reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat such
Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with past practice. Such member of the SpinCo Group

member of the RemainCo Group to whom such Delayed Retained Asset is to be
transferred or assigned, or which will assume such Delayed Retained Liability,
as the case may be, in order to place such member of the RemainCo Group in a
substantially similar position as if such Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed
Retained Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as contemplated
hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed
Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may be, including
use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over
such Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability, as the case may

of any such Delayed Retained Asset or Delayed Retained Liability have been

have any member(s) of the RemainCo Group removed as guarantor of or obligor

relevant parties to such guarantee agreement, which agreement shall include
the removal of any Security Interest on or in any Retained Asset that
may serve as collateral or security for any such Assumed Liability, except to
the extent that such existing guarantee contains representations, covenants or
other terms or provisions either (A) with which SpinCo would be reasonably
unable to comply or (B) which SpinCo would not reasonably be able to avoid
breaching; and

(ii) any member of the SpinCo Group (including any Subsidiary of SpinCo), the

other form as is agreed to by the relevant parties to such guarantee
agreement, which agreement shall include the removal of any Security Interest
on or in any Transferred Asset that may serve as collateral or security for
any such Retained Liability, except to the extent that such existing
guarantee contains representations, covenants or other terms or provisions

which the Company would not reasonably be able to avoid breaching.

 

(c) if the Company or SpinCo is unable to obtain, or cause to be obtained, any
such required removal or release as set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this
_Section 2.5_, (i) the Party or the relevant member of its Group that has
assumed the Liability with respect to such guarantee shall indemnify, defend

2.7 _Treatment of Shared Contracts_

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and without limiting the generality of the
obligations set forth in _Section 2.1_, unless the Parties otherwise agree
or the benefits of any Contract described in this _Section 2.7_ are expressly
conveyed to the applicable Party pursuant to this Agreement, any Contract,
only a portion of which is a Transferred Contract (any such Contract, a "
_Shared Contract_ "), shall be assigned in relevant part to the applicable
member(s) of the applicable Group, if so assignable, or appropriately amended
prior to, on or after the Effective Time, so that each Party or the member
of its Group shall, as of the Effective Time, be entitled to the rights and
benefits, and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities, inuring to
its respective businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall
any member of any Group be required to assign (or amend) any Shared Contract
in its entirety or to assign a portion of any Shared Contract which is not
assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms (including any terms imposing
consents or conditions on an assignment where such consents or conditions
have not been obtained or fulfilled) and (ii) if any Shared Contract cannot be
so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be amended or if
such assignment or amendment would impair the benefit the Parties thereto
derive from such Shared Contract, then the Parties shall, and shall cause each
of the members of their respective Groups to, take such other reasonable and
permissible actions (including by providing prompt notice to the other Party
with respect to any relevant claim of Liability or other relevant matters
arising in connection with a Shared Contract so as to allow such other Party
the ability to exercise any applicable rights under such Shared Contract) to
cause a member of the SpinCo Group or the RemainCo Group, as the case may be,
to receive the rights and benefits of that portion of each Shared Contract
that relates to the Nevada Business or the Mexico Business, as the case may be
(in each case, to the extent so related), as if such Shared Contract had been
assigned to (or amended to allow) a member of the applicable Group pursuant to
this _Section 2.7_, and to bear the burden of the corresponding Liabilities
(including any Liabilities that may arise by reason of such arrangement), as
if such Liabilities had been assumed by a member of the applicable Group
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_.

 

(b) Each of the Company and SpinCo shall, and shall cause the members of its
Group to, (i) treat for all Tax purposes the portion of each Shared Contract
inuring to its respective businesses as Assets owned by, and/or Liabilities
of, as applicable, such Party, or the members of its Group, as applicable, not
later than the Effective Time, and (ii) neither report nor take any
Tax position (on a Tax return or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment
(unless required by applicable Law).

 



21 (c) Nothing in this _Section 2.7_ shall require any member of any Group to
make any non- _de minimis_ payment (except to the extent advanced, assumed or
agreed in advance to be reimbursed by any member of the other Group), incur
any non- _de minimis_ obligation or grant any non- _de minimis_ concession for
the benefit of any member of any other Group in order to effect any
transaction contemplated by this _Section 2.7_. For purposes of this _Section
2.7_, " _de minimis_ " shall be determined in reference to customary contracts
of similar nature, character and size to the Shared Contracts and not in
reference to the value of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the Distribution.

the " _SpinCo Accounts_ ") and all Contracts governing each bank or brokerage
account owned by the Company or any other member of the RemainCo Group
(collectively, the " _Company Accounts_ ") so that each such SpinCo Account

withdrawal, automatic deposit or any other authorization to transfer funds
from or to, hereinafter " _Linked_ ") to any the Company Account or SpinCo
Account, respectively, is de-Linked from such the Company Account or SpinCo
Account, respectively. 

(b) With respect to any outstanding checks issued or payments initiated by the
Company, SpinCo, or any of the members of their respective Groups prior to
the Effective Time, such outstanding checks and payments shall be honored
following the Effective Time by the Person or Group owning the account on
which the check is drawn or from which the payment was initiated,
respectively; provided, that to the extent any such amounts are honored after
the Effective Time by a Person or Group for the benefit of the other Group,
such amount shall be reimbursed within five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time.

 

As between the Company and SpinCo (and the members of their respective
Groups), all payments made and reimbursements received after the Effective
Time by either Party (or member of its Group) that relate to a business, Asset
or Liability of the other Party (or member of its Group), shall be held by
such Party in trust for the use and benefit of the Party entitled thereto
and, promptly following receipt by such Party of any such payment or
reimbursement, such Party shall pay over, or shall cause the applicable member
of its Group to pay over to the other Party the amount of such payment or
reimbursement without right of set-off.

be made with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, prior to the Distribution concerning the satisfaction
or waiver of any or all of the conditions set forth in _Section 3.1(a)_
shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Company waives any
material condition, it shall promptly issue a press release disclosing such
fact and file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC describing such
waiver.

3.2 _The Distribution_

 

(a) Subject to _Section 3.1_, on or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will appoint a distribution agent (the " _Distribution Agent_ ") to deliver a
true, correct and complete

 



24  copies of the transfer records reflecting the holders of the Company Common
Stock entitled to receive SpinCo Common Stock in connection with the
Distribution. The Company will deliver to, or cause the delivery to, the
Distribution Agent for the benefit of the Record Holders sufficient
outstanding SpinCo Common Stock to make the Distribution, and shall cause its
transfer agent to instruct the Distribution Agent to
distribute electronically on the Distribution Date, or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, the appropriate number of shares of SpinCo Common
Stock to each Record Holder or designated transferee(s) of such Record Holder
by way of direct registration in book-entry form. SpinCo will not issue paper
share certificates. The Company will cooperate, and will instruct the
Distribution Agent to cooperate, with SpinCo and the SpinCo Transfer Agent,
and SpinCo will cooperate, and will instruct the SpinCo Transfer Agent to
cooperate, with the Company and the Distribution Agent, in connection with all
aspects of the Distribution and all other matters relating to the issuance of
the SpinCo Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of the
Company Common Stock in connection with the Distribution.

(b) Subject to _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2(c)_, each Record Holder (or
such holders designated transferee(s)) will be entitled to receive in the
Distribution a number of whole shares of SpinCo Common Stock equal to the
number of the Company Common Stock held by such holder on the Record
Date, multiplied by the Distribution Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number.

(c) No fractional shares will be distributed or credited to book-entry
accounts in connection with the Distribution, and any such fractional
interests to which a Record Holder would otherwise be entitled shall not
entitle such Record Holder to vote or to any other rights as a stockholder of
SpinCo. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Record Holder who, but
for the provisions of this _Section 3.2(c)_, would be entitled to receive a
fractional interest of a share of SpinCo Common Stock pursuant to the
Distribution, shall be paid cash, without any interest thereon, as
hereinafter provided. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Company shall direct the Distribution Agent to determine the number of whole
and fractional shares of SpinCo Common Stock allocable to each Record Holder,
to aggregate all such fractional shares into whole shares, and to sell the
whole shares obtained thereby in the open market at then-prevailing prices on
behalf of each Record Holder who otherwise would be entitled to
receive fractional share interests (with the Distribution Agent, in its sole
and absolute discretion, determining when, how and through which broker-dealer
and at what price to make such sales), and to cause to be distributed to each
such Record Holder, in lieu of any fractional unit, such Record Holders or
owners ratable share of the total proceeds of such sale, after deducting any
Taxes required to be withheld and applicable transfer Taxes, and after
deducting the costs and expenses of such sale and distribution, including
brokers fees and commissions. None of the Parties or the Distribution Agent
will be required to guarantee any minimum sale price for the fractional shares
of SpinCo Common Stock sold in accordance with this  _Section 3.2(c)_. None
of the Parties or the Distribution Agent will be required to pay any interest
on the proceeds from the sale of fractional shares. Neither the Distribution
Agent nor the broker-dealers through which the aggregated fractional shares
are sold shall be Affiliates of the Company or SpinCo. Solely for purposes of
computing fractional share interests pursuant to this _Section 3.2(c)_ and
_Section 3.2(d)_, the beneficial owner of the Company Common Stock held of
record in the name of a nominee in any nominee account shall be treated as the
Record Holder with respect to such shares.

 



25 (d) Any SpinCo Common Stock or cash in lieu of fractional shares with respect
to SpinCo Common Stock that remains unclaimed by any Record Holder one
hundred and eighty (180) days after the Distribution Date shall be delivered
to SpinCo, and SpinCo shall hold such SpinCo Common Stock or cash for the
account of such Record Holder, and the Parties agree that all obligations to
provide such SpinCo Common Stock and cash, if any, in lieu of fractional share
interests shall be obligations of SpinCo, subject in each case to applicable
escheat or other abandoned property Laws. Any amounts unclaimed by holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of SpinCo free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(e) Until the SpinCo Common Stock is duly transferred in accordance with this
_Section 3.2_ and applicable Law, from and after the Effective Time, SpinCo
will regard the Persons entitled to receive such SpinCo Common Stock as record
holders of SpinCo Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Distribution without requiring any action on the part of such Persons. SpinCo
agrees that, subject to any transfers of such stock, from and after the
Effective Time (i) each such holder will be entitled to receive
all distributions payable on, and exercise voting rights and all other rights
and privileges with respect to, the SpinCo Common Stock then held by such
holder, and (ii) each such holder will be entitled, without any action on the
part of such holder, to receive evidence of ownership of the SpinCo Common
Stock then held by such holder.

(f) The Company and the Distribution Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the distribution of shares of SpinCo Common Stock otherwise
payable to any Record Holder or designated transferee(s) or payee(s) of such
Record Holder (including any beneficial holder thereof) such amounts as the
Company or the Distribution Agent are required to deduct and withhold under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law. The Parties shall, with the prior written consent
of Parent, determine the appropriate mechanism and procedures for any such
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

the extent relating to, arising out of or resulting from the Mexico Business,

(c) _Obligations Not Affected_. Nothing contained in _Section 4.1(a)_ or

Merger Agreement, the Promissory Note or any Contracts that are specified in
_Schedule 2.6_ as not to terminate as of the Effective Time, in each case
in accordance with its terms. Nothing contained in _Section 4.1(a)_ or

(i) any Liability provided in or resulting from any Contract among any members
of the RemainCo Group or the SpinCo Group that is specified in _Schedule 2.6_
to terminate as of the Effective Time;

(ii) any Liability, contingent or otherwise, assumed, transferred, assigned

of the RemainCo Group from (i) honoring its existing obligations to indemnify
any director, officer or employee of SpinCo or any member of the SpinCo Group
who was a director, officer or employee of any member of the RemainCo Group on
or prior to the Effective Time, to the extent such director, officer or
employee becomes a named defendant in any Action with respect to which such
director, officer or employee was entitled to such indemnification pursuant to
such existing obligations under the organization documents of the Company; it
being understood that, if the underlying obligation giving rise to such Action
is an Assumed Liability, SpinCo shall indemnify the Company for such Liability
(including the Companys costs to indemnify the director, officer or

(ii) honoring any of its obligations to indemnify any director, officer or

Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, SpinCo shall, and shall cause the other members of
the SpinCo Group, as applicable, to, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Company, each other member of the RemainCo Group and
each of their respective past, present and future stockholders, directors,
officers, employees and agents, in each case in their respective capacities
as such, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of
the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company Indemnitees_ "), from and against
any and all Liabilities of the Company Indemnitees relating to, arising out
of or resulting from, directly or indirectly, any of the following items
(without duplication):

 

(a) any Assumed Liability;

 



28 (b) any failure of SpinCo, any other member of the SpinCo Group or any other
Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any Assumed
Liabilities in accordance with their terms, whether prior to, on or after the
Effective Time;

 

(c) any breach by SpinCo or any other member of the SpinCo Group of this
Agreement;

 

(d) except to the extent it relates to a Retained Liability, any guarantee,
indemnification or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit
support Contract for the benefit of any member of the SpinCo Group by any
member of the RemainCo Group that survives following the Distribution; and

 

(e) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with
respect to all information contained in the Form S-1 or any Exchange Act
registration statement filed by SpinCo in connection with the Distribution.

 

4.3 _Indemnification by the Company_

 

Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the Company shall, and shall cause the other members
of the RemainCo Group to, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless SpinCo, other members of the SpinCo Group and each of their
respective past, present and future stockholders, directors, officers,
employees or agents, in each case in their respective capacities as such, and
each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _SpinCo Indemnitees_ "), from and against any and all
Liabilities of the SpinCo Indemnitees relating to, arising out of or
resulting from, directly or indirectly, any of the following items (without
duplication):

 

(a) any Retained Liability;

 

(b) any failure of the Company, any other member of the RemainCo Group or any
other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any Retained
Liabilities in accordance with their terms after the Effective Time;

(c) any breach by the Company or any other member of the RemainCo Group of
this Agreement after the Effective Time; and

(d) except to the extent it relates to an Assumed Liability, any guarantee,
indemnification or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit
support Contract for the benefit of any member of the RemainCo Group by any
member of the SpinCo Group that survives following the Distribution.

 

4.4 _Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts_

 

(a) The Parties intend that any Liability subject to indemnification,
contribution or reimbursement pursuant to this _Article IV_ will be net of
Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof)

 



29  from any Person by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of any
indemnifiable Liability. Accordingly, the amount which either Party (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") is required to pay to any Person entitled to
indemnification or contribution hereunder (an " _Indemnitee_ ") will be
reduced by any Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually recovered (net of
any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from
any Person by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of the related
Liability. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an " _Indemnity Payment_ ")
required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any
Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds or any other amounts in
respect of the related Liability, then the Indemnitee will pay to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment
received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if
the Insurance Proceeds or such other amounts (net of any out-of-pocket costs
or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) had been received, realized or
recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.

(b) The Parties agree than an insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay
any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto
or, solely by virtue of any provisions contained in this Agreement, have any
subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being understood that no insurer
or any other Third Party shall be entitled to a "windfall" (i.e., a benefit
they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification
provisions) by virtue of the indemnification and contribution provisions
hereof. Each Party shall, and shall cause the members of its Group to, use
commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the probability of
success on the merits and the cost of expending such efforts, including
attorneys fees and expenses) to collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds
that may be collectible or recoverable respecting the Liabilities for which
indemnification or contribution may be available under this _Article IV_.

 

4.5 _Procedures for Indemnification of Third-Party Claims_

 

(a) _Notice of Claims_. If, at or following the date of this Agreement, an
Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a
Person (including any Governmental Entity) who is not a member of the RemainCo
Group or the SpinCo Group of any claim or of the commencement by any such
Person of any Action (collectively, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") with respect
to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification to
such Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 4.2_ or _4.3_ , or any other Section of
this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written
notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
twenty (20) days (or sooner if applicable Law, statute of limitation or the
nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires) after becoming aware of such
Third-Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, including the facts and circumstances giving rise to such
claim for indemnification, and include copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-
Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnitee to
provide notice in accordance with this _Section 4.5(a)_ shall not relieve an
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement,
except to the extent to which the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by
the Indemnitees failure to provide notice in accordance with this _Section
4.5(a)_.

 



30 (b) _Control of Defense_. An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and seek
to settle or compromise), at its own expense and with its own counsel, any
Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming
and controlling defense of such Third-Party Claim, it shall first confirm to
the Indemnitee in writing that, assuming the facts presented to the
Indemnifying Party by the Indemnitee being true, the Indemnifying Party shall
indemnify the Indemnitee for any such Damages to the extent resulting from, or
arising out of, such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense and, in the course of defending such
Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party discovers that the facts
presented at the time the Indemnifying Party acknowledged its indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim were not true in all material
respects and (ii) such untruth provides a reasonable basis for asserting that
the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification obligation in respect
of such Third-Party Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound
by such acknowledgment, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall promptly thereafter
provide the Indemnitee written notice of its assertion that it does not have
an indemnification obligation in respect of such Third-Party Claim and (C) the
Indemnitee shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a notice from an
Indemnitee in accordance with _Section 4.5(a)_ (or sooner if applicable Law,
statute of limitation or the nature of the Third-Party Claim so requires), the
Indemnifying Party shall provide written notice to the Indemnitee indicating
whether the Indemnifying Party shall assume responsibility for defending the
Third-Party Claim. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume
responsibility for defending any Third-Party Claim or fails to notify an
Indemnitee of its election within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
notice from an Indemnitee as provided in _Section 4.5(a)_, then the
Indemnitee that is the subject of such Third-Party Claim shall be entitled to
continue to conduct and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

(c) _Allocation of Defense Costs_. If an Indemnifying Party has elected to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, then such Indemnifying Party shall
be solely liable for all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with
the defense of such Third-Party Claim and shall not be entitled to seek any
indemnification or reimbursement from the Indemnitee for any such fees or
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party during the course of the defense
of such Third-Party Claim by such Indemnifying Party, regardless of any
subsequent decision by the Indemnifying Party to reject or otherwise
abandon its assumption of such defense. If an Indemnifying Party elects not
to assume responsibility for defending any Third-Party Claim or fails to
notify an Indemnitee of its election within thirty (30) days after receipt of
a notice from an Indemnitee as provided in _Section 4.5(a)_, and the
Indemnitee conducts and controls the defense of such Third-Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all
reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(d) _Right to Monitor and Participate_. An Indemnitee that does not conduct
and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim, or an Indemnifying Party
that has failed to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim as contemplated
hereby, nevertheless shall have the right to employ separate counsel
(including local counsel as necessary) of its own choosing to monitor and
participate in (but not control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim for
which it is a potential Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, and the provisions of

 



31   _Section 4.5(c)_ shall not apply to such fees and expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to _Sections 6.7_ and _6.8_ , such
Party shall cooperate with the Party entitled to conduct and control the
defense of such Third-Party Claim in such defense and make available to the
controlling Party, at the non-controlling Partys expense, all witnesses,
information and materials in such Partys possession or under such Partys
control relating thereto as are reasonably required by the controlling Party.
In addition to the foregoing, if any Indemnitee shall in good faith determine
that such Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party have actual or potential
differing defenses or conflicts of interest between them that make joint
representation inappropriate, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ separate counsel (including local counsel as necessary) and to
participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement
thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for all Indemnitees.

 

(e) _No Settlement_. No Party may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
for which a Party is seeking to be indemnified hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, unless such settlement or compromise is (i) solely for monetary
damages, (ii) does not involve any finding or determination of wrongdoing or
violation of Law by the other Parties, and (iii) provides for a full,
unconditional and irrevocable release of the other Parties from all Liability
in connection with the Third-Party Claim.

 

(f) _Mixed Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
4.5_, in the event that a Third-Party Claim for which a Party is seeking to
be indemnified hereunder involves matters for which the other Party or its
indemnitees is also entitled to indemnification hereunder (for example, a
Third Party Claim involving both Retained Liabilities and
Assumed Liabilities), then the Company shall be entitled to control the
defense of such Third Party Claim, and SpinCo shall reimburse the Company for
its proportionate share of all defense costs associated therewith.

 

4.6 _Additional Matters_

 

(a) _Timing of Payments_. Indemnification or contribution payments in respect
of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or
contribution under this _Article IV_ shall be paid within forty-five (45)
days of the final determination of the amount that the Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification or contribution under this  _Article IV_ by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon
demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation
setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification
or contribution payment, including documentation with respect to calculations
made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the
amount of such Liabilities. The indemnity and contribution provisions
contained in this  _Article IV_ shall remain operative and in full force and
effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any
Indemnitee, or (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of any Liabilities for
which it might be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(b) _Notice of Direct Claims_. Any claim for indemnification or contribution
under this Agreement that does not result from a Third-Party Claim shall be
asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the applicable
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the failure by an

 



32  Indemnitee to so assert any such claim shall not prejudice the ability of
the Indemnitee to do so at a later time except to the extent (if any) that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Such Indemnifying Party shall have
a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice within which to
respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such
thirty (30)-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such
Indemnitee shall, subject to the provisions this Agreement, be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this
Agreement, as applicable, without prejudice to its continuing rights to
pursue indemnification or contribution hereunder.

(c) _Pursuit of Claims Against Third Parties_. If (i) a Party incurs any
Liability arising out of this Agreement, (ii) an adequate legal or equitable
remedy is not available for any reason against the other Party to satisfy the
Liability incurred by the incurring Party, and (iii) a legal or equitable
remedy may be available to the other Party against a Third Party for such
Liability, then the other Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the incurring Party, at the incurring Partys expense, to
permit the incurring Party to obtain the benefits of such legal or equitable
remedy against the Third Party.

(d) _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any
Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim,
such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of
such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which
such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-
Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim
or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such
Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of
such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or
claim.

(e)  _Substitution_. In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying
Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party
shall so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying
Party for the named defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be
achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow
the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in Section 4.5 and
this Section 4.6, and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named
defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs,
sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys fees, experts fees and all other
external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement and the cost of
any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.

(f) _Remedies Cumulative_. The remedies provided in this Article IV shall be
cumulative and, subject to the provisions of Article VIII, shall not preclude
assertion by any Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all
other remedies against any Indemnifying Party.

4.7 _Right of Contribution_

 

(a) _Contribution_. If any right of indemnification contained in _Section
4.2_ or _4.3_ is held unenforceable or is unavailable for any reason, or is
insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnitee in respect of any Liability for
which such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder, then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by the
Indemnitees as a result of such Liability (or actions in respect thereof) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party and the members of its Group, on the one hand, and the
Indemnitees entitled to contribution, on the other hand, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

 



33 (b) _Allocation of Relative Fault_. Solely for purposes of determining
relative fault pursuant to this _Section 4.7_: (i) any fault associated with
the business conducted with the Delayed Transferred Assets or Delayed Assumed
Liabilities (except for the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of a
member of the RemainCo Group) or with the ownership, operation or activities
of the Nevada Business prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be the
fault of SpinCo and the other members of the SpinCo Group, and no such fault
shall be deemed to be the fault of the Company or any other member of the
RemainCo Group; (ii) any fault associated with the business conducted with
Delayed Retained Assets or Delayed Retained Liabilities (except for the gross
negligence or intentional misconduct of a member of the SpinCo Group) shall
be deemed to be the fault of the Company and the other members of the RemainCo
Group, and no such fault shall be deemed to be the fault of SpinCo or any
other member of the SpinCo Group; and (iii) any fault associated with the
ownership, operation or activities of the Mexico Business prior to the

EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

 

6.1 _Agreement for Exchange of Information_

 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.9_ and any other applicable confidentiality
obligations, each of the Company and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each
member of its Group, agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
or make available, or cause to be provided or made available, to the other
Party and the members of such other Partys Group, at any time before, on or
after the Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable after written
request therefor, any information (or a copy thereof) in the possession or
under the control of such Party or its Group which the requesting Party or its

any such provision of information could violate any Law or Contract, or waive
any privilege available under applicable Law, including any attorney-client
privilege, then the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
permit compliance with such obligations to the extent and in a manner that
avoids any such harm or consequence. The Party providing information pursuant
to this _Section 5.1_ shall only be obligated to provide such information in
the form, condition and format in which it then exists, and in no event shall
such Party be required to perform any improvement, modification, conversion,
updating or reformatting of any such information, and nothing in this _Section

period of time afterwards as required for each Party to prepare consolidated
financial statements or complete a financial statement audit for the fiscal
year during which the Distribution Date occurs), each Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Partys
information requests to enable (i) the other Party to meet its timetable for

assessment of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and
its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Items 307 and
308, respectively, of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act; and
(ii) the other Partys accountants to timely complete their review of the

including, to the extent applicable to such Party, its auditors audit of its
internal control over financial reporting and managements assessment thereof
in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SECs
and Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards rules and auditing standards
thereunder and any other applicable Laws.

 



35 6.2 _Ownership of Information_

 

The provision of any information pursuant to _Section 5.1_ or _5.7_ shall not
affect the ownership of such information (which shall be determined solely in

in or to any such information.

The Party requesting information agrees to reimburse the other Party for the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if any, of copying, and transporting such
information.

6.4 _Record Retention_

 

To facilitate the possible exchange of information pursuant to this _Article
VI_ and other provisions of this Agreement after the Effective Time, the
Parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to retain all
information in their respective possession or control on the Effective Time in
accordance with the policies of the Company as in effect on the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any information
relating to Taxes, employee benefits or Environmental Liabilities, such
retention period shall be extended to the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations (giving effect to any extensions thereof).

6.5 _Limitations of Liability_

 

Neither Party shall have any Liability to the other Party in the event that
any information exchanged or provided pursuant to this Agreement is found to
be inaccurate in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the
Party providing such information. Neither Party shall have any Liability to
any other Party if any information is destroyed after commercially
reasonable efforts by such Party to comply with the provisions of _Section
6.4_.

6.6 _Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information_

(a) Any party that receives, pursuant to request for information in accordance
with this _Article VI_ , Tangible Information that is not relevant to its
request shall (i) return it to the providing Party or, at the providing

providing Party written confirmation that such Tangible Information was
returned or destroyed, as the case may be, which confirmation shall be signed
by an authorized representative of the requesting Party.

 

6.7 _Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation_

 

(a) After the Effective Time, each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to the other Party, upon written request, the
former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and
agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books,
records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the
ability to make available without undue burden, to the extent that any such
Person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers,
employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents
may reasonably be required in connection with any Action in which the
requesting Party (or member of its Group) may from time to time be involved,
regardless of whether such Action is a matter with respect to which
indemnification may be sought hereunder. The requesting Party shall bear all
costs and expenses in connection therewith.

 



36 (b) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or
settle any Third-Party Claim, the other Party shall make available to such
Indemnifying Party, upon written request, the former, current and future
directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the members of
its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other documents
within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available
without undue burden, to the extent that any such Person (giving consideration
to business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel
and agents) or books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in
connection with such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution,
evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate
in such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or
pursuit, as the case may be.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall cooperate and consult
to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to any Actions.

(d) Without limiting any provision of this _Section 6.7_, each of the
Parties agrees to cooperate, and to cause each member of its respective Group

claim with respect any Intellectual Property and shall not claim to
acknowledge, or permit any member of its respective Group to claim to
acknowledge, the validity or infringing use of any Intellectual Property of a
third Person in a manner that would hamper or undermine the defense of such
infringement or similar claim.

(e) The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this
_Section 6.7_ is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and shall include the obligation to provide as witnesses inventors
and other officers without regard to whether the witness or the employer of
the witness could assert a possible business conflict (subject to the
exception set forth in the first sentence of _Section 6.7(a))_.

6.8 _Privileged Matters_  

(a) The Parties recognize that legal and other professional services that have
been and will be provided prior to the Effective Time have been and will be
rendered for the collective benefit of each of the members of the RemainCo
Group and the SpinCo Group, and that each of the members of the RemainCo Group
and the SpinCo Group should be deemed to be the client with respect to
such services for the purposes of asserting all privileges which may be
asserted under applicable Law in connection therewith. The Parties recognize
that legal and other professional services will be provided following the
Effective Time, which services will be rendered solely for the benefit of the
RemainCo Group or the SpinCo Group, as the case may be.

(b) The Parties agree as follows: 

(i) the Company shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or
waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection with any Privileged
Information that relates solely to the Mexico Business and not to the Nevada
Business, whether or not the Privileged Information is in the possession or
under the control of any member 

 



37  of the RemainCo Group or any member of the SpinCo Group. The Company shall
also be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or waiver of all
privileges and immunities in connection with any Privileged Information that
relates solely to any Retained Liabilities resulting from any Actions that are
now pending or may be asserted in the future, whether or not the Privileged
Information is in the possession or under the control of any member of the
RemainCo Group or any member of the SpinCo Group; and

(ii) SpinCo shall be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the assertion or
waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection with any Privileged
Information that relates solely to the Nevada Business and not to the Mexico
Business, whether or not the Privileged Information is in the possession or
under the control of any member of the SpinCo Group or any member of the
RemainCo Group. SpinCo shall also be entitled, in perpetuity, to control the
assertion or waiver of all privileges and immunities in connection with any
Privileged Information that relates solely to any Assumed Liabilities
resulting from any Actions that are now pending or may be asserted in the
future, whether or not the Privileged Information is in the possession or
under the control of any member of the SpinCo Group or any member of the
RemainCo Group.

(iii) If the Parties do not agree as to whether certain information
is Privileged Information, then such information shall be treated as
Privileged Information, and the Party that believes that such information is
Privileged Information shall be entitled to control the assertion or waiver of
all privileges and immunities in connection with any such information unless
the Parties otherwise agree. The Parties shall use the procedures set forth in
_Article IX_ to resolve any disputes as to whether any information relates
solely to the Mexico Business, solely to the Nevada Business, or to both the
Mexico Business and the Nevada Business.

(c) Subject to the remaining provisions of this  _Section 6.8_, the Parties
agree that they shall have a shared privilege or immunity with respect to all
privileges and immunities not allocated pursuant to _Section 6.8(b)_ and all
privileges and immunities relating to any Actions or other matters that
involve both Parties (or one or more members of their respective Groups) and
in respect of which both Parties have Liabilities under this Agreement, and
that no such shared privilege or immunity may be waived by either Party
without the consent of the other Party.

(d) If any dispute arises between the Parties or any members of their
respective Group regarding whether a privilege or immunity should be waived
to protect or advance the interests of either Party and/or any member of their
respective Group, each Party agrees that it shall (i) negotiate with the other
Party in good faith; (ii) endeavor to minimize any prejudice to the rights of
the other Party; and (iii) not unreasonably withhold consent to any request
for waiver by the other Party. Further, each Party specifically agrees that it
shall not withhold its consent to the waiver of a privilege or immunity for
any purpose except in good faith to protect its own legitimate interests.

(e) In the event of any adversarial Action or dispute between the Company and
SpinCo, or any members of their respective Groups, either Party may waive a
privilege in which the other Party or member of such other Partys Group has a
shared privilege, without obtaining

 



38  consent pursuant to _Section 6.8(c)_; _provided_ , that such waiver of a
shared privilege shall be effective only as to the use of information with
respect to the Action between the Parties and/or the applicable members of
their respective Groups, and shall not operate as a waiver of the shared
privilege with respect to any Third Party.

 

(f) Upon receipt by either Party, or by any member of its respective Group, of
any subpoena, discovery or other request that may reasonably be expected to
result in the production or disclosure of Privileged Information subject to a
shared privilege or immunity or as to which another Party has the sole right
hereunder to assert a privilege or immunity, or if either Party obtains
knowledge that any of its, or any member of its respective Groups, current
or former directors, officers, agents or employees have received any subpoena,
discovery or other requests that may reasonably be expected to result in the
production or disclosure of such Privileged Information, such Party shall
promptly notify the other Party of the existence of the request within five
(5) business days following the receipt of any such subpoena, discovery or
other request and shall provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to
review the Privileged Information and to assert any rights it or they may have
under this _Section 6.8_ or otherwise, to prevent the production or
disclosure of such Privileged Information.

 

(g) Any furnishing of, or access or transfer of, any information pursuant to
this Agreement is made in reliance on the agreement of the Company and SpinCo
set forth in this _Section 5.8_ and in _Section 5.9_ to maintain the
confidentiality of Privileged Information and to assert and maintain all
applicable privileges and immunities. The Parties agree that their respective
rights to any access to information, witnesses and other Persons, the
furnishing of notices and documents and other cooperative efforts between the
Parties contemplated by this Agreement, and the transfer of Privileged
Information between the Parties and members of their respective Groups
pursuant to this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver of any privilege that
has been or may be asserted under this Agreement or otherwise.

 

(h) In connection with any matter contemplated by _Section 6.7_ or this
_Section 6.8_, the Parties agree to, and to cause the applicable members of
their Group to, use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain their
respective separate and joint privileges and immunities, including by
executing joint defense and/or common interest agreements where necessary or
useful for this purpose.

6.9 _Confidentiality_

 

(a) _Confidentiality_. Subject to _Section 6.10_, from and after the
Effective Time until the five (5) year anniversary of the Effective Time,
each of the Company and SpinCo, on behalf of itself and each member of its
respective Group, agrees to hold, and to cause its respective Representatives
to hold, in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care
that applies to the Companys confidential and proprietary information
pursuant to policies in effect as of the Effective Time, all confidential and
proprietary information concerning the other Party or any member of the other
Partys Group or their respective businesses that is either in its possession
(including confidential and proprietary information in its possession prior to
the date hereof) or furnished by any such other Party or any member of such
Partys Group or their respective Representatives at any time pursuant to
this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Promissory Note and shall not use
any such confidential and proprietary information other than

 



39  for such purposes as shall be expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder,
except, in each case, to the extent that such confidential and proprietary
information has been (i) in the public domain or generally available to the
public, other than as a result of a disclosure by such Party or any member of
such Partys Group or any of their respective Representatives in violation of
this Agreement, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources by such Party
(or any member of such Partys Group) which sources are not themselves bound
by a confidentiality obligation or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality with respect to such confidential and
proprietary information, or (iii) independently developed or generated without
reference to or use of any proprietary or confidential information of the
other Party or any member of such Partys Group. If any confidential and
proprietary information of one Party or any member of its Group is disclosed
to the other Party or any member of such other Partys Group in connection
with providing services to such first Party or any member of such first
Partys Group under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Promissory
Note then such disclosed confidential and proprietary information shall be
used only as required to perform such services.

 

(b) _No Release; Return or Destruction_. Each Party agrees not to release or
disclose, or permit to be released or disclosed, any information addressed in
_Section 6.9(a)_ to any other Person, except its Representatives who need to
know such information in their capacities as such (who shall be advised of
their obligations hereunder with respect to such information), and except in
compliance with _Section 6.10_. Without limiting the foregoing, when any such
information is no longer needed for the purposes contemplated by this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Promissory Note, each Party
will promptly after request of the other Party either return to the other
Party all such information in a tangible form (including all copies thereof
and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) or notify the other Party
in writing that it has destroyed such information (and such copies thereof
and such notes, extracts or summaries based thereon).

(c) _Third-Party Information; Privacy or Data Protection Laws_. Each Party
acknowledges that it and members of its Group may presently have and,
following the Effective Time, may gain access to or possession of confidential
or proprietary information of, or personal information relating to, Third
Parties (i) that was received under confidentiality or non-disclosure
Contracts entered into between such Third Parties, on the one hand, and the
other Party or members of such Partys Group, on the other hand, prior to the
Effective Time; or (ii) that, as between the two Parties, was originally
collected by the other Party or members of such Partys Group and that may be
subject to and protected by privacy, data protection or other applicable
Laws. Each Party agrees that it shall hold, protect and use, and shall cause
the members of its Group and its and their respective Representatives to hold,
protect and use, in strict confidence the confidential and proprietary
information of, or personal information relating to, Third Parties in
accordance with privacy, data protection or other applicable Laws and the
terms of any Contracts that were either entered into before the Effective Time
or affirmative commitments or representations that were made before the
Effective Time by, between or among the other Party or members of the other
Partys Group, on the one hand, and such Third Parties, on the other hand.

 



40 6.10 _Protective Arrangements_

 

In the event that a Party or any member of its Group either determines on the
advice of its counsel that it is required to disclose any information
pursuant to applicable Law or receives any request or demand under lawful
process or from any Governmental Entity to disclose or provide information of
the other Party (or any member of the other Partys Group) that is subject
to the confidentiality provisions hereof, such Party shall notify the other
Party (to the extent legally permitted) as promptly as practicable under the
circumstances prior to disclosing or providing such information and shall
cooperate, at the expense of the other Party, in seeking any appropriate
protective order requested by the other Party. In the event that such other
Party fails to receive such appropriate protective order in a timely manner
and the Party receiving the request or demand reasonably determines that its
failure to disclose or provide such information shall actually prejudice the
Party receiving the request or demand, then the Party that received such
request or demand may thereafter disclose or provide information to the
extent required by such Law (as so advised by its counsel) or by lawful
process or such Governmental Entity, and the disclosing Party shall promptly
provide the other Party with a copy of the information so disclosed, in the
same form and format so disclosed, together with a list of all Persons to
whom such information was disclosed, in each case to the extent legally
permitted.

 

6.11 _Disclosure Relating to the S-1 and S-4_

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of
_Sections 6.9_ and _6.10_ shall not apply to any disclosures made in
connection with the Form S-1 or Form S-4.

other Party good and marketable title to the Assets allocated to such Party
under this Agreement, free and clear of any Security Interest, if and to the
extent it is practicable to do so.

Partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax return or Tax proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

Company, as the case may be, occurring immediately prior to the Effective
Time or as a payment of an Assumed Liability or a Retained Liability; and (b)
any payment of interest as taxable or deductible, as the case may be, to the

independent of the other Party, with responsibility for its own actions and
inactions and its own Liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting

Effective Time and each Party shall (except as otherwise provided in _Article
IV_ ) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such Liabilities from
being inappropriately borne by the other Party.

with or into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving

that for a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, it will
not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly,

prevented from receiving such compensation by reason of the fact that he or
she is also a director of the Corporation. Nothing contained herein shall
preclude any officer from serving the Corporation, or any subsidiary, in any
other capacity and receiving such compensation by reason of the fact that he
or she is also a director of the Corporation.

Section 4.11  _Delegation of Duties_. In the absence, disability or refusal
of any officer to exercise and perform his or her duties, the Board of
Directors may delegate to another officer such powers or duties.

 

Section 4.12 _Corporate Funds and Checks_. The funds of the Corporation shall
be kept in such depositories as shall from time to time be prescribed by the
Board of Directors. All checks or other orders for the payment of money shall
be signed by the President or the Treasurer or such other person or agent as
may from time to time be authorized and with such countersignature, if any,
as may be required by the Board of Directors.

Section 4.13 _Contracts and Other Documents_. The President or the Treasurer,
or such other officer or officers as may from time to time be authorized by
the Board of Directors or any other committee given specific authority by the
Board of Directors during the intervals between the meetings of the Board
of Directors, shall have power to sign and execute on behalf of the
Corporation deeds, conveyances and contracts, and any and all other documents
requiring execution by the Corporation. ARTICLE V

 

STOCK

Section 5.1  _Certificates of Stock_. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, _provided_ , that the Board of Directors may
provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or
series of stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not
apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is
surrendered to the Corporation. Every holder of stock represented by
certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name
of the Corporation by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors,
if any, or the President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of
the Corporation certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the
Corporation. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a
facsimile. The Board of Directors shall have the power to appoint one or more
transfer agents and/or registrars for the transfer or registration of
certificates of stock of any class, and may require stock certificates to be
countersigned or registered by one or more of such transfer agents and/or
registrars.

 

Section 5.2 _Transfer of Shares_. Shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable upon its books by the holders thereof, in person or by their
duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives, upon surrender and
delivery to the Corporation of the certificate representing such shares and a
duly executed instrument authorizing transfer of such shares, if certificated,
or delivery of a duly executed instrument authorizing transfer of such
shares, if uncertificated, to the person in charge of the stock and transfer
books and ledgers. If certificated, such certificates shall be cancelled and
new certificates shall thereupon be issued. A record shall be made of each
transfer. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral
security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the
transfer if, when the certificates are presented, both the transferor and
transferee request the Corporation to do so. The Board of Directors shall have
power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem
necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer and registration
of certificates for shares of stock of the Corporation.

Section 5.3 _Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates_. A
new certificate of stock may be issued in the place of any certificate
previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, and the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her legal
representative, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the Board of
Directors may direct, in order to indemnify the Corporation against any claims
that may be made against it in connection therewith. A new certificate of
stock may be issued in the place of any certificate previously issued by the
Corporation that has become mutilated without the posting by the owner of any
bond upon the surrender by such owner of such mutilated certificate. Section 5.4 _List of Stockholders Entitled To Vote_. The stock ledger shall be
the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list
required by Section 219 of the DGCL or to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of stockholders.

 

Section 5.5 _Dividends_. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors may at any regular or special meeting,
declare dividends upon the stock of the Corporation either (a) out of its
surplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with Sections 154 and 244 of
the DGCL or (b) in case there shall be no such surplus, out of its net
profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the
preceding fiscal year. Before the declaration of any dividend, the Board of
Directors may set apart, out of any funds of the Corporation available for
dividends, such sum or sums as from time to time in its discretion may be
deemed proper for working capital or as a reserve fund to meet contingencies
or for such other purposes as shall be deemed conducive to the interests of
the Corporation.

 

Section 5.6 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If
the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless
the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date,
that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for
making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 10 days after the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If
no record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board of
Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by
law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on which
a signed written consent  setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution taking such prior action.

 

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not be more than 60
days prior to such other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record
date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close
of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 

Section 5.7 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the Corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to
vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner. Except as otherwise required by law, the Corporation shall
not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

Section 6.1 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to, or was or is otherwise involved in, any
action, suit, arbitration, alternative dispute mechanism, inquiry, judicial,
administrative or legislative hearing, investigation or any other threatened,
pending or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the
Corporation or otherwise, including any and all appeals, whether of a civil,
criminal, administrative, legislative, investigative or other nature
(hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or an officer of the Corporation or while a director or
officer of the Corporation is or was serving at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), or
by reason of anything done or not done by him or her in any such capacity,
shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest
extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement by or
on behalf of the indemnitee) actually and reasonably incurred by such
indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
otherwise required by law or provided in Section 6.3 with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights under this Article VI, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding, or part
thereof, initiated by such indemnitee (including claims and counterclaims,
whether such counterclaims are asserted by (i) such indemnitee, or (ii) the
Corporation in a proceeding initiated by such indemnitee) only if such
proceeding, or part thereof, was authorized or ratified by the Board of
Directors. Section 6.2 _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the right
to indemnification conferred in Section 6.1, an indemnitee shall, to the
fullest extent not prohibited by law, also have the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any
proceeding with respect to which indemnification is required under Section
6.1 in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an " _advancement of
expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that an advancement of expenses shall
be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter
an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all
amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction from which there is no further
right to appeal (hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 6.2 or
otherwise.

 

Section 6.3 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a request for
indemnification under Section 6.1 is not paid in full by the Corporation
within 60 days, or if a request for an advancement of expenses under Section
6.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 20 days, after a written
request has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Delaware seeking an adjudication of entitlement
to such indemnification or advancement of expenses. If successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement
of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.
Further, in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the
indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification
set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a
committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall
create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this
Article VI or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. Section 6.4 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VI shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or otherwise.

Section 6.5 _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Section 6.6 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time, grant rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of
the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VI
with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors
and officers of the Corporation.

 

Section 6.7 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article VI shall be contract rights that shall vest at the time an individual
becomes a director or officer of the Corporation and such rights shall
continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or
trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors
and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VI
that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be
prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect
to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any
action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration
or repeal.

 

Section 6.8 _Settlement of Claims_. The Corporation shall not be liable to
indemnify any indemnitee under this Article VI for any amounts paid in
settlement of any proceeding effected without the Corporations written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or for any judicial
award if the Corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity,
at its expense, to participate in the defense of such proceeding.

Section 6.9 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment under this Article VI, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the
rights of recovery of the indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required
and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

 

Section 6.10 _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article VI
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article VI (including,  without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable,
that are not by themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (b) to the fullest extent
possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation,
all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not
themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give
effect to the intent of the parties that the Corporation provide protection
to the indemnitee to the fullest enforceable extent.

ARTICLE VII

given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to such
person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified
in such a waiver. Attendance at any meeting shall constitute waiver of notice
