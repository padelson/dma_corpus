_Section 5.7_ ).

 

 

Section 2.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. Seller shall retain and, as between Buyer
and Seller, shall be responsible for  all Liabilities of Seller other than
the Assumed Liabilities (including the Excluded Liabilities).

 

 

Section 2.5 _Purchase Price_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, in consideration for the Transfer of the Transferred Assets to
Buyer, at the Closing, Buyer shall (a) pay to  Seller by wire transfer to a
bank account designated in writing by Seller to Buyer, an amount in cash equal
to the Closing Cash Consideration in immediately available funds in United
States dollars and (b) assume the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

Section 2.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

 

(a) _Illustrative Closing Net Working Capital Calculation_. _Exhibit 2.6(a)_
sets forth, for illustrative purposes only, a  calculation of the Net Working
Capital calculated as of the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles (the " _Illustrative Closing Net
Working Capital Calculation_ ").

 

 

(b) _Closing Estimate_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing 
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an Estimated Closing Statement prepared by
Seller in good faith, together with supporting documentation used by Seller in
calculating the amounts set forth therein. If Buyer notifies Seller in writing
of an  objection to the Estimated Closing Statement (which written notice
shall, in good faith, describe in reasonable detail the specific items in or
excluded from the Estimated Closing Statement that are in dispute and the
nature and amount of any  disagreement so identified) at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer and Seller shall seek in
good faith to agree to revisions to the Estimated Closing Statement to resolve
such objection and Seller shall update and  redeliver the Estimated Closing
Statement to reflect any such agreements no later than the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date. If Buyer has validly provided notice of
an objection to the Estimated Closing Statement pursuant to  this _Section
2.6(b)_ and Buyer and Seller fail to mutually agree upon revisions to the
Estimated Closing Statement on or prior to the Business Day immediately prior
to the Closing Date, then: (i) neither Buyer nor Seller shall delay the 
Closing because of such failure and (ii) the amounts set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement to which Buyer objects, without any adjustment,
shall be the amounts used in the determination of the Closing Cash
Consideration. The agreement  of the Parties to revisions to the Estimated
Closing Statement or the failure of the Parties to agree to such revisions
shall not constitute a waiver or limitation of a Party's rights and
obligations pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_ or  otherwise. The Estimated Closing
Statement shall also set forth wire transfer instructions for the payment of
the Closing Cash Consideration to Seller.

 

 

 

25  

(c) _Post-Closing Determination_.

 

 

(i) _Delivery of the Post-Closing Statement_. No later than ninety (90) days
after the  Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Post-Closing
Statement prepared by Buyer in good faith, together with supporting
documentation used by Buyer in calculating the amounts set forth therein.

 

 

(ii) _Access to Information_. From and after delivery of the Post-Closing
Statement until the determination of the Final Closing  Statement, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, upon reasonable prior notice from
Seller and subject to execution of customary work paper access letters if
requested by accountants of Seller, (A) provide Seller and its authorized 
representatives, in connection with Seller's review of the Post-Closing
Statement, with access during normal business hours to the books and records
and work papers of Buyer and (B) cooperate with and assist Seller and its
authorized  representatives in connection with the review of such materials,
including by making reasonably available its employees, accountants and other
personnel to the extent reasonably requested. For the avoidance of doubt,
access to books, records,  work papers, employees, accountants and other
personnel pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)(ii)_ shall not result in an
obligation to reimburse any of Buyer's expenses pursuant to _Section 5.1_.

 

 

(iii) _Notice of Objection_. If Seller has any objection to the  Post-Closing
Statement or any of the amounts included in the calculation of the Final Cash
Consideration set forth therein, it shall deliver to Buyer a written statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement, 
including the specific items in the Post-Closing Statement that are in dispute
and the nature and amount of any disagreement so identified (such written
statement, a " _Notice of Objection_ "), not later than sixty (60) days after
its  receipt of the Post-Closing Statement; _provided_ , that such period
shall be tolled and extended to account for any delay or failure by Buyer to
provide reasonable access in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)(ii)_ (such sixty
(60) day  period, as may be extended, the " _Review Period_ "). If Seller
delivers a Notice of Objection to Buyer within the Review Period, Seller and
Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve Seller's objections within the
thirty (30) day period  following the delivery of the Notice of Objection. If
Seller fails to deliver a Notice of Objection within the Review Period, the
Post-Closing Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller and
shall be deemed final and binding upon  all of the Parties for purposes of
this _Section 2.6_ and shall be deemed the Final Closing Statement.

 

 

 

26  

(iv) _Selection of the Accountant_. In the event that Seller and Buyer are
unable to resolve in writing any of Seller's objections in  the Notice of
Objection within the thirty (30) day period (or such longer period as may be
agreed by Buyer and Seller) after the delivery of such Notice of Objection,
the resolution of all of such unresolved objections (" _Disputed Items_ ") 
shall be submitted to Grant Thornton LLP (or such other accounting firm of
recognized national standing in the United States as may be mutually selected
by Buyer and Seller) which shall resolve such objections and determine the
Final Cash  Consideration. If, within fifteen (15) days of the end of the
thirty (30) day period, Grant Thornton LLP is not willing and able to serve in
such capacity and Buyer and Seller otherwise fail to appoint an alternative
accounting firm mutually  selected by Buyer and Seller, then Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a list of three (3) independent accounting firms of
recognized national standing in the United States and Buyer shall select one
of such three accounting firms (such firm  ultimately selected pursuant to
the aforementioned procedures being the " _Accountant_ "). Seller and Buyer
shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accountant for its
engagement hereunder.

 

 

(v) _Submission of Disputed Items_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall, promptly
(but in any event within ten (10) Business Days) following the formal
engagement of  the Accountant, provide the Accountant with a single written
submission setting forth its respective calculations of and assertions
regarding the Disputed Items (which submissions the Accountant shall promptly
distribute to the other Party) and  upon receipt thereof, each of Seller and
Buyer shall be entitled (no later than five (5) Business Days following
receipt of the other Party's initial submission) to submit to the Accountant a
single written response to such other Party's  initial submission setting
forth such Party's objections or rebuttals to the calculations and/or
assertions set forth in such initial submission (which responses the
Accountant shall promptly distribute to the other applicable Party). There 
shall be no ex parte communications between Seller (or its representatives) or
Buyer (or its representatives), on the one hand, and the Accountant, on the
other hand, relating to the Disputed Items and  unless requested by the
Accountant in writing, no Party may present any additional information or
arguments to the Accountant, either orally or in writing.

 

 

(vi) _Accountant 's Determination_. The Accountant shall be instructed to
render its determination with respect to the Disputed Items  as soon as
reasonably possible (which the Parties agree shall not be later than thirty
(30) days following the formal engagement of the Accountant). The Accountant
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to determine solely the 
Disputed Items based solely on the submissions and responses of Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, without independent investigation and
in accordance with the Accounting Principles. In resolving any disputed amount
in  connection with its determination of the Final Cash Consideration, the
Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by  either Party. The Parties agree that the determination of
the Accountant with respect to any Disputed Items is not intended to permit
the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures,  classifications or estimation
methodologies for the purposes of determining the Final Cash Consideration,
and the Accountant shall not conduct an independent investigation of facts and
circumstances but shall instead base its determination on  its expertise in
GAAP, accounting rules and the written submissions of the Parties delivered
pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)(vi)_ with respect to
the Disputed Items. The determination of the Accountant in  accordance with
this _Section 2.6(c)(vi)_ shall be binding and final for purposes of this
_Section 2.6_ of this Agreement. The Post-Closing Statement resulting from the
determinations with respect to the Disputed Items made by the  Accountant in
accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)(vi)_ shall be deemed the Final Closing
Statement.

 

 

 

27  

(vii) _Accountant 's Fees and Expenses_. The Accountant shall allocate its
fees and expenses between Buyer and Seller based upon the percentage of the
contested  amount submitted to the Accountant that is ultimately awarded to
Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, such that Buyer bears a
percentage of such fees and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested
amount awarded to  Seller and Seller bears a percentage of such fees and
expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Buyer. For
the avoidance of doubt, the fees and disbursements of the representatives of
each Party incurred in connection  with the preparation or review of the
Post-Closing Statement and any Notice of Objection as well as any submissions
and responses to the Accountant, as applicable, shall be borne by such Party.

 

 

(d) _Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_. Within two (2) Business Days
following the determination of the Final Closing  Statement:

 

 

(i) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount, if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number;

 

 

(ii) Seller shall pay an amount to Buyer equal to the absolute value of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a
negative number.

 

 

Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any payment obligation pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(d)_ if the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount
is less than $250,000. Any payment made pursuant to  this _Section 2.6(d)_
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, pursuant to the
instructions previously delivered by Buyer or Seller, as applicable. Any such
payment shall, for tax purposes, be deemed to be an  adjustment to the
consideration payable to Seller.

 

 

(e) _Final and Binding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the final determination of Final Cash Consideration under _Section 
2.6(c)(iii)_ or _Section 2.6(c)(vi)_ shall be binding and final for purposes
of this _Section 2.6_ of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 2.7 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Transferred
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Closing_
")     shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell, 125 Broad
Street, New York, New York 10004 at 10:00 A.M. New York City time, on the
fifth Business Day following the date on which the last of the conditions set
forth in _Article  VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions) has been satisfied or waived, or at such other time and
place as the Parties may  mutually agree. The date on which the Closing
occurs is called the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

 

Section 2.8 _Deliveries by Buyer_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to Seller the following:

 

 

(a) the Closing Cash Consideration to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.5_ ;

 

 

 

28  

(b) a duly executed counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements;

 

 

(c) the final form of the RandW Insurance Policy, effective as of the Closing;

 

 

(d) the certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)_ ; and

 

 

(e) such other instruments of assumption and other instruments or documents,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller, as may be necessary to
effect  Buyer's assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and the assignment of
any Transferred Assets, in each case duly executed by Buyer or the applicable
Buyer Ancillary Counterparty.

 

 

Section 2.9 _Deliveries by Seller_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer the following:

 

 

(a) a duly executed certification that Seller is not a foreign Person within
the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B);
_it_ _being_ _understood_ _that_   notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if Seller fails to provide Buyer with such certification,
Buyer's sole remedy shall be to withhold the requisite amount from the Closing
Cash Consideration in accordance with Section  1445 of the Code and the
applicable Treasury Regulations;

 

 

(b) a duly executed counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements;

 

 

(c) the certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_ ;

 

 

(d) (i) any tangible embodiments of the Transferred Intellectual Property
(other than Joint IP), (ii) any tangible embodiments of the Joint IP that are
held for use by  the Business (but in no event less than one copy of any
tangible embodiment of the Joint IP), in each case of (i) and (ii), to the
extent such tangible embodiments exist as of the Closing and are in the
possession or control of Seller or any of  its Affiliates, and (iii) one copy
of the source code included in the Transferred Intellectual Property;

 

 

(e) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that all Encumbrances (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) related to Transferred Assets or the Business
securing  Indebtedness for Borrowed Money have been released; and to the
extent requested by Buyer in respect of any specific Encumbrance (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) on any Transferred Asset, evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer that such  Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) have been released; and

 

 

(f) such other instruments of assumption and other instruments or documents,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, as may be necessary to
effect Buyer's  assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and the effective
assignment of any Transferred Assets, in each case duly executed by Seller.

 

 

 

29  

Section 2.10 _Nonassignability of Assets_. Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the Transfer or
attempted Transfer to Buyer of any asset that would be a Transferred Asset or
any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom 
is (i) prohibited by any applicable Law or (ii) without a Permit, Consent, or,
with respect to Government Prime Contracts, novation completed in accordance
with FAR Part 42, Subpart 42.12 (" _Novation_ "), would (A) constitute a
breach or  other contravention thereof, (B) subject Seller, Buyer, or any of
their respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, to civil or
criminal liability, (C) be ineffective, void or voidable, or (D) adversely
affect the rights thereunder of  Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
officers, directors, agents or Affiliates and such Permit, Consent or Novation
has not been obtained or completed prior to the Closing, then in each case,
the Closing shall proceed without the Transfer  of such asset unless the
failure to Transfer such asset causes a failure of any of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VI_ , in which event, the Closing shall proceed
only if the failed condition is waived by the Party or  Parties entitled to
the benefit thereof. In the event the Closing proceeds without the Transfer of
any such asset (other than Government Prime Contracts requiring Novation,
which shall be Transferred in accordance with _Section 5.10_ ),  then such
asset shall be regarded as a Transferred Asset for purposes of the
calculations of Net Working Capital, Estimated Net Working Capital and Closing
Net Working Capital required under _Section 2.6_ (but only if Buyer is
provided  with the economic claims, rights and benefits under such asset in
accordance with this Agreement). For a period of eighteen (18) months after
the Closing, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts  to
promptly obtain such Permit or Consent; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be
required to make any out-of-pocket payments to third parties in order to
obtain such Permit or Consent (except for out-of-pocket payments that Buyer
agrees to  reimburse to Seller), commence any litigation or make any material
concessions in connection with its obligations under this _Section 2.10_.
Pending obtaining such Permit or Consent, Seller and Buyer shall use their
commercially  reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to agree to any
reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide Buyer with the economic
claims, rights and benefits under such asset and assume the economic burdens
and obligations with  respect thereto in accordance with this Agreement,
including by subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer to the extent
contractually permissible. Buyer and Seller shall each pay their respective
expenses of such cooperation and  related actions. Once the required Permit
or Consent is obtained, Seller shall Transfer such asset to Buyer. For so long
as Seller holds any Transferred Assets and provides to Buyer any claims,
rights and benefits of any such Transferred  Assets pursuant to an
arrangement described in this _Section 2.10_ or any Ancillary Agreement, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against all Losses incurred
or asserted as a result of or in connection with Seller's  post-Closing
direct or indirect ownership, management or operation of any such Transferred
Assets, other than Losses to the extent resulting from or arising out of
Seller's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or breach of its 
obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

Section 2.11 _Affiliate Acquisitions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer  may, subject to Seller's consent
which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, elect to have
any or all of the Transferred Assets Transferred to, or any of the Assumed
Liabilities assumed by, one or more of its Affiliates so  long as no such
election results in any greater cost or obligation to Seller as Seller would
otherwise have had; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such election shall
relieve Buyer of any of its obligations to Seller hereunder with  respect to
the Assumed Liabilities or otherwise. The Final Cash Consideration shall be
allocated among those Transferred Assets to be conveyed to Buyer and those
Transferred Assets to be conveyed to the respective Affiliates of Buyer, but,
for  the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the amount of the Final Cash
Consideration or any other items to be paid for the Transferred Assets, the
nature of the Assumed Liabilities to be assumed, the obligation to pay Taxes
or Transfer Taxes or  the allocation of risk and responsibility between
Seller and Buyer be modified to the detriment of Seller as a result of the
delivery of separate bills of sale, assignments and other closing documents.

 

 

 

30  

Section 2.12 _Allocation of the Purchase Price_. The  Closing Cash
Consideration and any other amounts treated as consideration for tax purposes
(the " _Tax Consideration_ ") shall be allocated among the Transferred Assets
in accordance with a draft schedule prepared by Seller and delivered to 
Buyer within ninety (90) Business Days of the date on which the Post-Closing
Statement is finally determined allocating the Tax Consideration to the
Transferred Assets in accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury  Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule_ "). Buyer shall notify Seller within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Purchase Price Allocation Schedule of any objection Buyer may
have thereto. Seller and  Buyer agree to resolve any disagreement with
respect to such Purchase Price Allocation Schedule in good faith. Seller and
Buyer shall report consistently with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule on
all Tax Returns and neither Seller nor  Buyer shall take any position in any
Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
unless required to do so following an audit by the Internal Revenue Service or
by a final determination as defined in Section 1313  of the Code.

 

 

Section 2.13 _Withholding Taxes_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold such  amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law, with respect to
the making of any payment under this Agreement. Other than with respect to any
withholding requirement  arising out of a change in Law or facts occurring
after the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide written notice of intent to withhold to Seller at least five (5)
Business Days prior to such  withholding. With respect to any withholding
requirement arising out of a change in Law or facts occurring after the date
that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
such written notice described in the  immediately preceding sentence as soon
as possible. Buyer shall afford Seller the opportunity, and the Parties shall
cooperate in good faith, to reduce or eliminate any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted  and withheld by
Buyer and timely paid over to or deposited with the relevant Tax Authority by
Buyer, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person otherwise entitled to such payment  hereunder.

 

 

ARTICLE III

 

 

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_

 

 

Except (a) as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Buyer by Seller on or prior to the Execution
Date (the " _Seller Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed  that disclosure
of any item in any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which
the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face, without 
reading any documents referenced therein) or (b) as explicitly set forth in
the Seller Reports filed or furnished in the three years prior to the
Execution Date (excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" or
"forward-looking  statements" or "market risks" sections or other forward-
looking disclosures that are not specific or are cautionary or predictive in
nature), Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer, as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing, as  follows:

 

 

 

31  

Section 3.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Seller (a) is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing  under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (b) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties Related to the Business and to carry on the Business as presently
conducted,  and (c) is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties Related to the Business or conduct of
the Business requires such  qualification, except in the case of _clause (b)_
or _(c)_ where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 3.2 _Authority; Approval_. Seller has full corporate or other
organizational  power and authority to execute and deliver each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party, to perform its
obligations thereunder and to consummate the Transaction. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement  by Seller and the consummation of
the Transaction by Seller has been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Seller. The execution, delivery and
performance of each of the Ancillary Agreements to which  Seller is or will
be a party has been, or at the Closing will be, duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate or other action on the part of such Person. No vote or
consent of Seller's stockholders is required to approve and  authorize the
consummation by Seller of the Transaction. This Agreement has been, and each
of the Ancillary Agreements will be at Closing, duly executed and delivered by
Seller and, when executed and delivered by Buyer and the other parties 
thereto, will constitute a valid and binding agreement of Seller, enforceable
against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, preferential transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar  Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law) (the " _Bankruptcy    and Equity
Exception_ ").

 

 

Section 3.3   _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

 

(a) Other than (i) the filings and/or notices under the HSR Act, (ii) the
appropriate facility clearance transfer approval by DCSA for the  facility
set forth on _Section 3.3(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (" _DCSA
Approval_ "), (iii) notification of ownership changes (including notice of
ownership changes under FAR 52.215-19) and (iv) consents to novation of
certain  Government Contracts by a Federal Government Customer (including
novation under FAR Subpart 42.12), no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by Seller, nor are any Permits required  to be obtained
by Seller from, any Governmental Entity, in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by
Seller and the consummation of the Transaction, except those that the
failure  to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business, taken as a whole.

 

 

 

32  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party do not, and the  consummation
of the Transaction and any transactions contemplated by the Ancillary
Agreements will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of  termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under,
or result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) upon any of the Transferred Assets under any provision of (i)
any certificates of incorporation,  by-laws or comparable governing documents
of Seller, (ii) any Material Contract or (iii) assuming (solely with respect
to performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and consummation
of the Transaction) compliance with the  approvals contemplated by _Section
3.3(a)_ , any Law to which Seller, the Business and the Transferred Assets are
subject, except, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ above, for any such
breach, violation, termination,  default, creation or acceleration that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Business, taken as a whole.

 

 

Section 3.4 _Financial Statements._

 

_ 
  _

 

(a) Set forth on _Section 3.4(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter is a copy 
of the unaudited balance sheet (the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet_ ") and
unaudited statements of income and cash flows for the Business for the fiscal
year ended 2018 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (the " _Most
Recent  Balance Sheet Date_ ") (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_
"). The Financial Statements have been derived from Seller's accounting
records, which are maintained in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent
basis as modified  by the adjustments detailed in _Section 3.4(a)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter. The Carve Out Financial Statements, when completed,
will have been prepared in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by
Seller. Buyer acknowledges  that the Financial Statements were prepared, and
when completed, the Carve Out Financial Statements have been prepared, solely
for the purpose of the Transaction and that the Business has not been
conducted on a stand-alone basis. The  Financial Statements include, and when
completed, the Carve Out Financial Statements include, allocations, estimates
and assumptions not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and
financial position that would have resulted had the  Business been operated
and conducted on a stand-alone basis.

 

 

(b) The Financial Statements fairly present, and when completed, the Carve Out
Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects the financial
position of  the Business during the applicable period presented therein
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), subject to (i) the fact
that the Business was not operated on a stand-alone basis during such periods
and (ii) the fact that the  Financial Statements and Carve Out Financial
Statements (and the allocations and estimates made by the management of Seller
in preparing such Financial Statements and Carve Out Financial Statements) (A)
are not necessarily indicative of the  costs that would have resulted if the
Business had been operated on a stand-alone basis during such periods and (B)
may not be indicative of any such costs to Buyer and its Subsidiaries that
will result following the Closing. Except for those  representations and
warranties contained in this _Section 3.4_ , neither Seller nor any other
person makes any other representations or warranties with regard to the
Financial Statements or Carve Out Financial Statements.

 

 

(c) The Financial Statements were prepared, and when completed, the Carve Out
Financial Statements have been prepared, based upon the information contained
in the books  and records of the Business. The books and records of the
Business have been maintained in all material respects in compliance with
applicable legal and accounting requirements and fairly reflect, in all
material respects, all dealings and  transactions in respect of the
businesses, assets and liabilities of the Business.

 

 

 

33  

(d) There has been no write-up or revaluation increasing in any material
respect the book value of any of the Transferred Assets. There have been no
material  transactions involving the Business that properly should have been
set forth in the Financial Statements, and when completed, the Carve Out
Financial Statements, and which have not been properly so set forth. There are
no significant  deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design of internal
controls over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect Seller's ability in any material respect to record, process,
summarize and report financial  information Related to the Business.

 

 

(e) All Accounts Receivable (other than Intercompany Accounts that are
Accounts Receivable) are bona fide claims of Seller as of the Execution Date
and arose from valid  transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business.
_Section 3.4(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth an Accounts
Receivable aging report for Accounts Receivable that is true, correct and
complete in all material respects as of  the Execution Date.

 

 

(f) All accounts payable Related to the Business (other than Intercompany
Accounts that are accounts payable) as of the Execution Date set forth on
_Section 3.4(f)_   of the Seller Disclosure Letter are bona fide claims
against Seller as of the Execution Date and arose from valid transactions in
the Ordinary Course of Business. _Section 3.4(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter sets forth an aging  report for accounts payable Related to the
Business for Seller that is true, correct and complete in all material
respects as of the Execution Date.

 

 

Section 3.5 _Absence of Certain Changes._

 

 

(a) Since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date, Seller has conducted the
Business in the Ordinary Course, consistent with past practices in all
material respects (except  for actions related to the negotiation, execution
or delivery of this Agreement or the Transaction (or the sales process
relating to the potential sale of the Business)).

 

 

(b) From the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date until the Execution Date, there
has not been any Change in the  financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities, business or results of operations of the Business, which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have, a Material

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER_

 

 

Except (a) as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Seller by Buyer on or prior to the Execution
Date (the " _Buyer Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed  that disclosure of
any item in any section or subsection of the Buyer Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face, without  reading
any documents referenced therein), or (b) as explicitly set forth in the Buyer
Reports filed or furnished in the three (3) years prior to the Execution Date
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" or "forward-
looking  statements" or "market risks" sections or other forward-looking
disclosures that are not specific or are cautionary or predictive in nature),
Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller, as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing, as follows:

 

 

Section 4.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Buyer (a) is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (b) has  all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and (c) is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign legal entity 
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
in the case of _clause (b)_ or _(c)_ where the failure to be so qualified or
in  good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Buyer has made available to
Seller complete and correct copies of Buyer's certificate of incorporation and
by-laws, each as  so delivered is in full force and effect.

 

 

Section 4.2 _Authority; Approval_. Buyer and each of its Affiliates that is a
party to any of the Transaction Documents has full corporate or other
organizational power and  authority to execute and deliver each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party, to perform its
obligations thereunder and to consummate the Transaction. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer and  the consummation of
the Transaction by Buyer has been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Buyer. The execution, delivery and performance
of each of the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer or any of its  Affiliates
is or will be a party has been, or at the Closing will be, duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate or other action on the part of such
Person. No vote or consent of Buyer's stockholders is required to approve
and  authorize consummation by Buyer of the Transaction. This Agreement has
been, and each of the Ancillary Agreements will be at Closing, duly executed
and delivered by Buyer and, when executed and delivered by Seller and the
other parties hereto  and thereto, will constitute a valid and binding
agreement of Buyer enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

 

 

55  

Section 4.3 _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 

 

(a) Other than the approvals contemplated by _Section 3.3(a)_ , no material
notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by  Buyer with, nor
are any Permits required to be obtained by Buyer from, any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Buyer or the consummation of the 
Transaction, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party do not, and the consummation of
the Transaction  and any transactions contemplated by the Ancillary
Agreements will not, conflict with or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or  acceleration of any obligation under
(i) Buyer's certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar organizational
documents, (ii) any contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation binding upon Buyer, or (iii) assuming  (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and consummation of
the Transaction) compliance with the approvals contemplated by _Section
3.3(a)_ , any Law to which Buyer is subject except, in the case of  _clauses
(ii)_ and _(iii)_ above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default,
creation or acceleration that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.4 _Litigation_.   There are no Actions pending or, to Buyer's
Knowledge, threatened against Buyer that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. Buyer
is not a party to or subject to the provisions of  any material Order of any
Governmental Entity. There is no Action pending or, to Buyer's Knowledge,
threatened against Buyer that seeks to enjoin or obtain damages in respect of
the consummation of the Transaction or that questions the validity  of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or any action taken or to be taken by
Buyer in connection with the consummation of the Transaction.

 

 

 

56  

Section 4.5 _Available Funds_.   Buyer has delivered to Seller (i) a true,
correct and complete copy of a fully executed commitment letter dated on or
about the date of this Agreement from the Financing Sources (together with all
exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets  attached thereto and as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced, waived or extended from time to
time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section 5.22_
(collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ ")), and (ii) true,  correct and
complete (other than with respect to redacted fees, fee amounts, pricing
terms, pricing caps and other customarily-redacted economic terms, but which
redacted information does not relate to or adversely affect the amount, 
availability, enforceability or conditionality of the Financing) copies of
fully executed fee letter(s) and engagement letter(s) with respect to fees and
related arrangements with respect to the Financing (collectively, the " _Fee
Letter_ ",  and together with the Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment
Papers_ "), providing, subject to the terms and conditions therein, for debt
financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as
the " _Financing_ "). " _Financing    Sources_ " means the entities that
have committed to provide or arrange or otherwise have entered into agreements
in connection with all or any part of the Financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  including the parties to any
joinder agreements, indentures or credit agreements entered pursuant thereto
or relating thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Papers
have not been amended or modified, and, to the Knowledge of  Buyer, no such
amendment or modification is contemplated, and none of the respective
obligations and commitments contained in the Commitment Papers have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect and, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, no  such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated;
_provided_ , that the existence or exercise of "market flex" or similar
provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall not constitute an amendment or
modification of the Commitment  Papers. Assuming the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letter, Buyer will have sufficient cash on hand
on the Closing Date to pay the Closing Cash Consideration and all other cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement. As  of the date of this
Agreement, the Commitment Papers are (y) legal, valid and binding obligations
of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Buyer and,  to
the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties thereto (in each case,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights, or by
principles  governing the availability of equitable remedies) and (z) in full
force and effect. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or, to
the Knowledge of  Buyer, any other party thereto under the Commitment Papers.
The only conditions precedent (including any market "flex" provisions
contained in the Commitment Papers) related to the obligations of the
Financing Sources under the Commitment Papers  to fund the full amount of the
Financing are those expressly set forth in the Commitment Papers and there are
no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce the total
amount of the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement,  Buyer has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all of
the terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Commitment Papers on or
prior to the Closing Date, nor does Buyer have Knowledge that any of the 
Financing Sources will not perform its obligations thereunder. As of the date
of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other
agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the Commitment
Papers that could  reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount,
availability, enforceability or conditionality of the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Papers. Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment fees
or other fees that are required to be  paid on or before the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Papers. In no event shall
the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Buyer or any of its  Affiliates or any
other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Buyer's
obligations under this Agreement. Buyer will have at all times during the term
of this Agreement (i) cash on hand and (ii) Eligible Receivables (as such 
term is defined in that certain Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement
dated as of January 21, 2020 between Buyer, Engility Services, LLC, each
Additional Seller (as defined therein) and MUFG Bank, Ltd.) in an  aggregate
amount of no less than $200 million.

intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.

its probable liability on its existing debts as they mature or become due),
(ii) will  have adequate capital and liquidity with which to engage in its
businesses and (iii) will not have incurred and does not plan to incur debts
beyond its ability to pay as they mature or become due.

any of their respective directors or employees (including any officers) has
employed any broker, finder or investment bank or has incurred or will incur
any obligation or  liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders
fees in connection with the Transaction. Buyer is solely responsible for the
fees and expenses of any such agent, broker, finder or investment banker.

information about the Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the 
Business as it has requested.

 

 

Section 4.9 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Buyer has received  a written commitment
from the RandW Insurer to fully bind the RandW Insurance Policy effective as of
the Closing Date. Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that it has provided
a true and correct copy of such commitment to Seller that is  in full force
and effect prior to the Execution Date. The Parties acknowledge that obtaining
such commitment and the RandW Insurance Policy is a material inducement to each
of the Parties' entering into the Transaction, and that Seller is  relying on
Buyer's covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section 4.9_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy is not a condition to the 
Closing and Buyer shall remain obligated, subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ of this Agreement, to
consummate the Transaction.

 

 

Section 4.10 _OFAC_.

a manner that may result in unauthorized access to classified information or

circumstance related to Buyer or its ownership would preclude or delay
national security classification clearance approval sufficient to perform its

not require Seller (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of Seller would result in the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets or  trade secrets of third parties or violate
any of Seller's obligations with respect to confidentiality (provided Seller

financial  statements, taxes, reporting obligations, litigation, compliance
or as otherwise reasonably requested by Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.2(b)_ , Seller may withhold access, documents or
information,  the disclosure of which in the reasonable judgment of Seller
would (I) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
(II) violate any Law applicable to Seller that requires Seller to restrict or

Person or otherwise), initiate or participate in any negotiations or
discussions, or enter into, accept or authorize any agreement or agreement
in  principle, or announce any intention to do any of the foregoing, with

Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, neither Seller nor Buyer shall

uses its best efforts to consult with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate  thereat.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section
5.4_ , Buyer agrees to proffer and agree to (i) sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise  encumber, or hold separate pending such
disposition, any of the assets, products, equity interests or properties of
the Business, Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates, (ii) create, terminate or
amend existing relationships, ventures,  contractual rights or obligations of
the Business, Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates and (iii) otherwise take or
commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit Buyer's freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to operate  and/or retain any of the
businesses, assets, products, equity interests or properties of the Business,
Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates, in each case, and the entry into
agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant  Governmental
Entity giving effect thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Execution Date if such action is reasonably necessary or advisable to (A)
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened

delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the 
Transaction by any Governmental Entity and (B) obtain HSR Act Clearance prior

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Buyer shall not be
required to take  or cause to be taken, do or cause to be done or effect any
Regulatory Concession that, individually or in the aggregate with all other
Regulatory Concessions, would or would reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on the  business, assets, Liabilities, financial
condition or results of operations of (x) Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole or (y) the Business, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in determining whether any  Regulatory Concession, individually or in the
aggregate with all other Regulatory Concessions, would or would reasonably be
expected to result in such a material adverse effect under either of the
foregoing _clauses (x)_ or _(y)_ ,  any adverse impact on the synergies
reasonably expected to be realized from the Transaction shall (without
duplication) be taken into account.

 

 

 

66

controlled Affiliates not to, take any action (including acquiring or agreeing
to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by  purchasing any assets of
or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof) that
would reasonably be expected to have the effect of (i) delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of, or increasing the risk of not receiving,  any Permit
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Transaction, (ii) delaying, impairing or impeding the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period with respect to any
such  Permit, (iii) increasing the risk of any Governmental Entity entering

materially  change Seller's facility security clearance with respect to the
applicable Government Contracts as a result of this Agreement or the

Contracts and Government Bids, subject to the terms  and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to use) their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents required from 
third parties in connection with the consummation of the Transaction at or
prior to the Closing. In addition to the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide
such evidence as to financial capability, resources, and creditworthiness as
may be  reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is
sought hereunder.

 

 

 

67  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall either party be required to make any out-of-pocket payment (except for
out-of-pocket payments that Buyer agrees to  reimburse to Seller) or any
material concessions to any third party, or commence any litigation, to obtain
any consents of third parties contemplated by this Section 5.5, and the
failure to receive any consents identified in the Seller  Disclosure Letter
shall not be taken into account with respect to whether any conditions to the

similar items (other than property and ad valorem Taxes) for the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the  close of business on the Closing
Date, and the amount of any other Taxes and any exemptions, allowances or
deductions determined for the entire Straddle Period, that in each case
relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and  including the
Closing Date shall equal the amount of such Tax, exemption, allowance or
deduction for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle
Period  ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total
number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes arising by reason of this Agreement
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.

Affiliate of each of them to sign and file all documentation with the relevant
Tax Authorities relating to such Transfer Taxes as may be required by
applicable Law.

 

 

(c) _Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause its
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with respect to Taxes that either Party is
liable for in respect of the Transferred  Assets, and shall retain for a
period of six (6) years following the end of the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, and provide to the other Party and its Affiliates, all records
and other information that are reasonably requested in  writing by the other

Section 5.7 _Post-Closing Obligations of the Business to Certain Employees_.

 

 

(a) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the Closing Date, offer employment in writing to each
active Business Employee providing for employment  commencing on the Closing
Date on the Current Employment Terms. With respect to Business Employees who
are inactive as of the Closing Date on account of short-term disability, long-
term disability, military leave, or other inactive employee  status or leave
of absence (including pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (or any
analogous state law)) (the " _Inactive Business Employees_ "), such Business
Employees' offers of employment will only become effective upon such 
employee presenting himself or herself for active employment with Buyer within
the reservation of employment period (but not later than 180 days from the
Closing, unless applicable law provides such Inactive Business Employee with 
instatement, reinstatement or similar rights for a longer period of time) and
otherwise in accordance with the terms of such Inactive Business Employee's
leave. Effective as of the Closing Date (or, with respect to Inactive
Business  Employees, the date on which such Inactive Business Employee
commences employment with Buyer), Seller shall terminate the employment of
each Business Employee.

 

 

 

68  

(b) Buyer agrees that each Transferred Employee shall, during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of
the Closing Date, be provided with employment on Current Employment Terms;
_provided_ that during such one-year period, the severance benefits provided
to each Transferred Employee (i) shall be no  less favorable than the greater
of (1) the severance benefits provided by Seller and its Subsidiaries to such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (2) the severance
benefits generally made available to similarly situated  employees of Buyer
and (3) for the Transferred Employees identified on _Section 5.7(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, cash severance of six (6) months of base salary and
(ii) shall be payable upon any termination of employment by  Buyer though the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, but not including a termination
of employment for cause. For purposes of this _Section 5.7(b)_ ,  the term
"cause" means the Transferred Employee's (i) intentional dishonesty in any
aspect of his or her employment; (ii) conviction (including pursuant to a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere) of any  felony, or a misdemeanor that impairs
the Transferred Employee's ability to substantially perform his or her job;
(iii) material breach of Buyer's Code of Conduct that is injurious to Buyer;
(iv) violation of any law or administrative  regulation related to Buyer's
business; (v) willful failure to perform, or gross negligence in performing,
the Transferred Employee's duties to a substantial degree; or (vi) use of
Buyer's confidential or proprietary information improperly.

 

 

(c) Effective as of the Closing, each Business Employee shall cease active
participation in any Benefit Plans that are not, as of the Closing, sponsored
or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer  shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Buyer or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Transferred  Employees and their
eligible dependents, other than conditions, limitations, or service
requirements that are already in effect with respect to such individuals and
that have not been satisfied as of the Closing under any analogous Benefit 
Plan immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) give each Transferred Employee
credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses for the plan
year which  includes the Closing Date for which payment has been made and
(iii) give each Transferred Employee service credit for such Transferred
Employee's employment with Seller to the same extent as such service was
credited for such purpose by  Seller under the analogous Benefit Plan for
purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each
applicable Buyer benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with
Buyer, except for defined benefit pension  plans or equity or equity-based
plans or long-term incentive plans or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits.

 

 

 

69  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date and thereafter (as applicable), Seller shall
take any and all actions as may be required to fully vest the Transferred
Employees in their account balances, to the extent  not already fully vested,
under the tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan of Seller in
which such Transferred Employees participated (" _Seller 's 401(k) Plan_") or
any other qualified profit sharing plan maintained by Seller  and permit such
Transferred Employees to rollover any associated loan notes to the extent
permitted under the applicable plan. Buyer shall take reasonable steps to
permit each such Transferred Employee who has received an eligible roll over 
distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code, including loan
notes) from Seller's 401(k) Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover
distribution, including any associated loans, as part of any lump sum
distribution in the form  of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a
combination thereof to the extent permitted by Seller's 401(k) Plan into an
account under the tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan
designated by Buyer (" _Buyer 's 401(k) Plan_").   Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make each Transferred Employee a
participant in Buyer's 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date (giving effect to the
service crediting provisions of this _Section 5.7(d)_; it being agreed  that
the intent is that there shall be no gap in participation in a tax qualified
defined contribution plan).

 

 

(e) With respect to any severance pay to which any Business Employee would
have been entitled pursuant to the Benefit Plan(s) applicable to such Business
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date  and set forth in _Section
3.8(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Buyer shall assume such liability for
any Business Employee who is not offered employment by Buyer and/or one of its
Affiliates in compliance with _Section 5.7(a)_.     For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of this _Section 5.7(e)_ , Buyer shall be deemed to be in
compliance with _Section 5.7(a)_ if Buyer and/or one its Affiliates corrects
any failure due to an inadvertent administrative error  or unforeseen
circumstances to offer employment to any Business Employee employment as set
forth therein within five (5) Business Days following any written notice of
such failure by Seller.

 

 

(f) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, assume all unpaid obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates to each
Transferred Employee pursuant to any sales  commission, annual bonus or other
cash incentive programs or arrangements, in each case in respect of any
performance period that includes the Closing Date and to the extent reflected
in the Closing Net Working Capital.

 

 

(g) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time, flexible time-off
and sick pay to which any Transferred Employee is entitled pursuant to the
policies applicable to such Transferred Employee  immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall assume such liability to the extent reflected in
the Closing Net Working Capital and (ii) Buyer shall allow such Transferred
Employee to use such accrued vacation, flexible time-off and  sick pay
accrued and unused by such Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date
pursuant to Buyer's applicable policies in effect from time to time.

 

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Buyer or Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates from amending or  terminating any of their
benefit plans in accordance with their terms, (iii) prevent Seller, Buyer or
any of their Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Transferred
Employee, (iv) obligate Buyer to adopt or maintain any particular  plan or
program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time, or (v)
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Business Employee, any
beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof,  with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Transferred Employee by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Buyer or any of
its Affiliates may  maintain.

 

 

 

70  

(i) Following the Closing, upon written request from Buyer and at Buyer's sole
expense, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation  and similar restrictive
covenant obligations covering a former Business Employee to the extent related
to the Business.

 

 

Section 5.8 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, the Business, the
Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities shall cease to be insured by
Seller's current and historical insurance  policies or by any of their self-
insurance programs or other similar arrangements, and Buyer (a) agrees to
arrange for its own insurance policies (including self-insurance or similar
arrangements funded directly or indirectly by Buyer or any  of its
Affiliates) with respect to the Business, the Transferred Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities and (b) without prejudice to any right to indemnification
under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the RandW Insurance Policy, 
agrees not to seek, through any means, to benefit from any of Seller's
insurance policies which may provide coverage for claims relating in any way
to the Business. Seller may, effective at or after the Closing, amend any
insurance policies  and ancillary arrangements in the manner they deem
appropriate to give effect to this _Section 5.8_. This Agreement shall not be
considered an attempted assignment of any policy of insurance or as a contract
of insurance and shall not  be construed to waive any right or remedy of
Seller in respect of any insurance policy or any other contract or policy of
insurance.

 

 

Section 5.9 _Non-Solicitation/Non-Competition_.

 

 

(a) Seller agrees that for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the second (2nd) anniversary of the  Closing Date, it will not
directly or indirectly (i) solicit for employment or any similar arrangement
any Transferred Employee or (ii) hire or assist any other Person in hiring any
Transferred Employee; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that this _Section 5.9(a)_
(i) shall not apply to Transferred Employees who have left the employment of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates more than six (6) months prior to the date of
first solicitation or hiring and (ii) shall not  prohibit (A) general
solicitations for employment through advertisements or other means not
specifically directed toward employees of Buyer or its Affiliates or (B)
hiring any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer.

 

 

(b) Seller agrees that for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the second (2nd) anniversary of the  Closing Date, it shall not,
and shall cause each Non-Competition Party not to, directly or indirectly, on
its own or through any other Person acting on its behalf, engage as a
stockholder, owner, partner, joint venturer or independent  contractor, or
otherwise manage or engage, in any business that competes with the Business,
in each case as conducted or actively pursued or marketed by Seller anywhere
in the United States (together, a " _Competing Business_ ").

 

 

 

71  

(c) Seller agrees that for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and
shall cause each Non-Competition Party not to,  directly or indirectly,
submit a bid, participate in any joint venture (or teaming, collaboration,
mentor or other agreement), the purpose of which is to submit a bid, or allow
its name, past performance or any credentials to be used, for (i)  any
recompete or bid, in each case for any Government Contract or any extension,
follow on, improvement, replacement, expansion of work or successor thereto
(including any Government Contract which includes but is not limited to the
sale of  services or products that are included in an existing Government
Contract or Government Bid), or any additional task orders in connection with
such Government Contract (including any IDIQ Government Contracts), or (ii)
any project, contract  or opportunity set forth in the potential proposals or
bids set forth on _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, that is
due for submission in or bid prior to December 31, 2021 or is otherwise set
forth on _Section  5.9(c)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter and, in each
case, is awarded to the Buyer or its subsidiaries (together the items
identified in (i) and (ii), the " _Legacy Recompetes and Opportunities_ ").
For purposes of _Section  5.9(b)_ and this _Section 5.9(c)_ , the Business
includes, without limitation, the business of providing any of the services,
products or technologies described in any Government Bid or Government
Contract.

 

 

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall not,
directly or indirectly, on their own or through any other Person acting on
their behalf (other than the Buyer), include in any  Government Bid, any past
performance information, evaluation or rating related to or associated with
any Business Employee or the Business; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Seller shall be permitted to include any past  performance
information, evaluation or rating related to or associated with the Business
in submissions to prospective customers and customers that are not Federal
Government Customers. The Parties agree that the use of such past
performance  information, evaluation or rating in Government Bids shall be
the exclusive right of Buyer, subject to the proviso in the preceding
sentence.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 5.9_ , nothing in _Section
5.9(b)_ shall preclude Seller or any Non-Competition Party from:

 

 

(i) being acquired for cash, stock or cash and stock by any Person engaged in
(or Affiliates thereof are engaged in) a Competing Business so long as Seller
and its Affiliates own less than 50% of the  pro forma company in the event
of an acquisition with stock consideration;

 

 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
that is engaged in a Competing Business if such Competing Business generated
less than 10% of such Person's consolidated  annual revenues in the trailing
4 fiscal quarter period of such Person prior to such acquisition; _provided_ ,
that, (A) if, in any trailing 4 fiscal quarter period thereafter ending prior
to the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing  Date, such Competing Business
generates revenues that exceed 10% of such Person's revenues in the trailing 4
fiscal quarter period of such Person prior to such acquisition, then (B)
Seller, within nine (9) months after the end of such  trailing 4 fiscal
quarter period, shall discontinue, or enter into a definitive agreement to
cause the divestiture of, a sufficient portion of the Competing Business of
such Person such that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.9_  
would not operate to restrict such ownership;

 

 

 

72  

(iii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business if (A) such
Competing Business generated 10% or more of such  Person's consolidated
annual revenues in the trailing 4 fiscal quarter period of such Person prior
to such acquisition and (B) Seller, within nine (9) months after the
consummation of such acquisition, discontinues, or enters into a  definitive

under or as contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in _Section 5.9(b)_ or _Section

(g) (i) Seller agrees that for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
expiring on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall not, and
shall cause each Non-Competition Party not  to, on its own or through any
other Person acting on its behalf, interfere with or disrupt Buyer's
performance of any of the Government Bids or Transferred Contracts transferred
to Buyer hereunder; and (ii) Seller agrees that for the period  commencing on
the Closing Date and expiring on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing
Date, it shall not, and shall cause each Non-Competition Party not to, on its
own or through any other Person, induce or attempt to induce any Federal 
Government Customer of the Business as of the Closing Date or vendor serving
the Business as of the Closing Date to cease or refrain from doing business
with Buyer or any Affiliate thereof.

 

 

(h) Seller acknowledges and agrees that, in executing this Agreement and
agreeing to pay the Final Cash Consideration, Buyer considers the obligations
of Seller to be valuable and an essential  inducement to the execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that it has special knowledge concerning the
Business and could substantially dilute the value thereof  by competing with
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or soliciting or hiring employees of the
Business or soliciting customers, suppliers or other Persons that have a
business relationship with the Business from and after the Closing Date, and
as  a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller
agrees to the terms in this _Section 5.9_ to preserve the value of Business
being acquired by Buyer.

 

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
this _Section 5.9_ were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or

and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Chosen Courts, this being in addition to  any other remedy to which Buyer is
entitled at law or in equity.

 

 

 

73  

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of a Change
of Control, the restrictions (i) set forth in _Section 5.9(b)_ and _Section

and _Section 5.9(g)(i)_ shall (A) immediately terminate if the Acquiror is a

any of the obligations or restrictions of the Seller, the Non-Competition
Parties or their assigns in connection with the Ancillary Agreements.

 

 

Section 5.10 _Novation_.

 

 

(a) The Parties recognize that, in accordance with the FAR Part 42, Subpart
42.12, novation of the Government Prime Contracts is necessary for the
transfer and assignment of the Government Prime  Contracts to Buyer and that
application for novation cannot be made until after the Closing and may take a
substantial amount of processing time. Promptly following the Closing Date,
Buyer and Seller shall complete its respective portion of  the documentation
required for novation of each Government Prime Contract by FAR 42.1204(c), and
Seller shall deliver its portion to Buyer. After the Closing Date, on behalf
of Seller, Buyer shall promptly submit the required documentation  to the
appropriate contracting officer and provide a copy thereof to Seller. Buyer
and Seller will thereafter, promptly and in coordination with the other
parties, respond appropriately to any requests from the contracting officer
for  additional information or documentation relating to such novation. Buyer
and Seller shall keep the other fully informed, on a current and timely basis,
as to the progress of the novation process and provide copies of all
letters,  correspondence, and other material documents to or from any Federal
Government Customer with respect thereto.

 

 

(b) In the interim period between (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the novation
of each of the Government Prime Contracts, or any resolution pursuant to
_Section 5.10(b)(vi)_ , or final close-out and  payment of the respective
Government Prime Contract, whichever first occurs (as to each individual
Contract, the " _Novation Period_ "), and subject to the Parties' negotiation
of a mutually-agreeable remedy pursuant to (c) below in the  event a
Government Prime Contract is not novated:

 

 

(i) Buyer will perform Seller's obligations under each of the Government Prime
Contracts in lieu of Seller, in accordance with a Subcontract Pending Novation
Agreement to be executed by each of Buyer  and Seller at the Closing in the
form set forth in _Exhibit G_. Seller, promptly following execution of this
Agreement, will advise the respective contracting officer of the intended
Subcontract Pending Novation Agreement and  facilitate appropriate meetings
between Buyer and the contracting officer.

 

 

 

74  

(ii) Any modification to a Government Prime Contract approved by Buyer and
Seller during the Novation Period will be duly executed by Seller.

 

 

(iii) To the extent acceptable to the applicable Federal Government Customer
(and except as provided in (iv) below), any other correspondence, invoices, or
other written submissions, including Government  Bids, requests for equitable
adjustments, claims, contract modifications, and requests for final decisions
that are mutually agreed between the Parties will be prepared by Buyer in the
name of Seller, coordinated with and submitted for  approval by Seller, which
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, signed by Seller if approved, and
submitted by Buyer to a Federal Government Customer. Seller shall respond
promptly to any request by a Federal Government Customer or  Buyer for
approval. In this context, Seller will designate an individual in writing
prior to Closing as " _Seller 's Designated Contract Representative_" to
receive and execute such documents for and on behalf of Seller, and Buyer
will  designate an individual in writing prior to the Closing as " _Buyer 's
Designated Contract Representative_" for all Government Contracts, to submit
such documents to, and receive such documents from, Seller's Designated
Contract  Representative. Each of Buyer and Seller may change the Buyer's
Designated Contract Representative or Seller's Designated Contract
Representative, as applicable, by written notice to the other. In addition, if
any certification is required,  Buyer shall certify to Seller in writing that
such certification is proper under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (the "
_CDA_ "), and not in violation of the False Claims Act, and upon receipt of
such certification the Seller shall  review and certify the claim under the
CDA for submittal to and decision by the contracting officer. In addition,
Seller may require from Buyer such reasonable additional documentation from
Buyer, and conduct such due diligence, as Buyer and  Seller shall reasonably
agree is appropriate prior to Seller making any submission to a Federal
Government Customer in reliance on information provided by Buyer.

 

 

(iv) During the Novation Period, Seller will be responsible for preparing and
certifying all pre-Closing cost claims, including all of Seller's direct,
indirect, and general and administrative cost  claims, for each Government
Prime Contract through the Closing Date. During the Novation Period for each
Government Prime Contract, Seller will submit such claims to the contracting
officer after consulting with Buyer, and immediately shall  provide Buyer a
copy of such submitted claims.

 

 

(v) During the Novation Period for each Government Prime Contract, each of
Buyer and Seller will cooperate fully at its own cost and reasonably assist
the other to obtain novation of such Government  Prime Contract into the name
of Buyer and under substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect at
the time of Closing and without materially adverse conditions upon either
Seller or Buyer, and to facilitate performance thereof by  Buyer. No Party
will take any action intended to interfere with or delay novation.

 

 

 

75  

(vi) Assuming Buyer is in compliance with its obligations under this _Section
5.10_ , if the appropriate contracting officer refuses to allow Buyer to
perform a Government Prime Contract pursuant to  a Subcontract Agreement
during the Novation Period, has not acted on the request for novation on a
Government Prime Contract by eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, or
refuses to permit novation of a Government Prime Contract under 
substantially the same terms and conditions as in effect at the time of the
Closing in the name of Buyer and without material adverse conditions upon
Seller or Buyer, then Seller and Buyer shall submit a request for approval to
the applicable  contracting officer for Buyer to perform such Government
Prime Contract pursuant to a permanent subcontract agreement between Buyer and
Seller. If the contracting officer for such Government Prime Agreement refuses
to approve such  subcontract, then Buyer and Seller shall work in good faith
to negotiate a mutually satisfactory remedy.

 

 

(c) Following the Novation Period, with respect to any Government Contract
that has been novated, Seller will be responsible for preparing and certifying
to Buyer all pre-Closing Date cost claims,  including all of Seller's direct,
indirect, and general and administrative cost claims, for each Government
Prime Contract through the Closing Date. Buyer will be responsible for
certifying (based on the Seller's certificate) and submitting  such claims to
the contracting officer. During and following the Novation Period for each
Government Prime Contract with respect to any Government Contract that has
been novated, each of Buyer and Seller will cooperate with the other in 
preparing and submitting such claims. With respect to all cost claims covering
periods prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for any and all
liabilities and obligations arising from such claims and shall pay or
otherwise  discharge such liabilities and obligations when due.

 

 

Section 5.11 _Government Bids_. As soon as practicable after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Parties shall prepare and submit to
prospective customers under Government Bids  appropriate notifications and
disclosures in connection with the Transaction. During the period between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, the Parties shall mutually agree on
reasonable and customary measures to maintain the viability of  the
Government Bids. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, Seller shall take
all reasonable actions and make all communications with any Federal Government
Customer that are mutually agreed by the Parties to be reasonably required
to  maintain the viability of such Government Bids. Buyer agrees that as of
the Closing it shall be bound by, and be responsible for the performance of,
all Government Bids in accordance with the terms and conditions (including
price) submitted  in such Government Bids. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in no event shall Seller be required to make any
payment, incur any liability or commence any litigation in connection with its
obligations under this _Section    5.11_.

 

 

Section 5.12 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party agrees to promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver, and
to cause its Affiliates to promptly  execute, acknowledge and deliver, any
assurances, documents or instruments of transfer, conveyance, assignment and
assumption reasonably requested by the other Party and necessary for the
requesting Party to satisfy its obligations hereunder  or to obtain the
benefits of the Transaction at the requesting Party's expense; _provided_ ,
that neither Party shall be required to make any out‑of‑pocket payments
(except for out-of-pocket payments that the requesting Party agrees to 
reimburse to the other Party), commence any litigation or make any material
concessions to third parties in connection with its obligations under this
_Section 5.12_.

 

 

 

76  

Section 5.13 _Confidentiality_.

 

 

(a) Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that the information being provided
to it in connection with the Transaction is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are  incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety; _provided_ , that actions taken by Buyer and
Seller to the extent necessary in order to comply with their respective
obligations under _Section 5.3_ and _Section 5.4_   hereunder shall not be
deemed to be in violation of this _Section 5.13_ or the Confidentiality
Agreement. Effective upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate in its entirety, including with respect to information  relating to
the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Employees or the Assumed
Liabilities; _provided_ , that each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that its
obligations of confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to any  and all
other information provided to it by or on behalf of Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, in connection with the Transaction (to the extent not related to
the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Employees or the
Assumed  Liabilities) shall continue to remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

(b) For two years after the Closing, unless Buyer has otherwise consented in
writing, Seller shall treat as confidential, shall not disclose to any other
Person and shall safeguard any and all  information to the extent such
information relates to the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred
Employees or the Assumed Liabilities.

 

 

(c) For two (2) years after the Closing, unless Seller has otherwise consented
in writing, Buyer shall treat as confidential, shall not disclose to any other
Person and shall safeguard any and all  information to the extent relating to
Seller (other than any such information to the extent related to the Business,
the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Employees or the Assumed Liabilities)
that becomes known to Buyer as a result of the  Transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.13(c)_ shall prevent the
disclosure of any such information, knowledge or data to any directors,
officers or employees of Buyer to whom such disclosure is  necessary or
desirable in the conduct of the Business if such Persons are informed by Buyer
of the confidential nature of such information and are required by Buyer to
comply with the provisions of this _Section 5.13(c)_.

 

 

(d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations set
forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and data that (i) is
or becomes available to the receiving Party on a  non-confidential basis from
a source other than the disclosing Party or its representatives; _provided_ ,
that such other source is not known by the receiving Party after due inquiry
to be bound by a confidentiality obligation to the  disclosing Party or is
otherwise prohibited from disclosing the information to the receiving Party,
(ii) is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result
of a violation by the receiving Party or its representatives of  the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.13_ ), (iii) is independently
developed by the receiving Party without use of or reference to confidential
information of the disclosing Party or violation of the obligations set forth
in this  _Section 5.13_ or (iv) is required to be disclosed by the receiving
Party to comply with applicable Law or stock market regulations or a judicial
or administrative proceeding (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information  or documents, subpoena, civil investigation demand or similar
process); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that any demand or
request for disclosure of such information is made pursuant to _clause (iv)_ ,
the receiving  Party, to the extent reasonable and legally permissible, shall
promptly notify the disclosing Party of its intention to make such disclosure
and provide a list of the information it intends to disclose (and, if
applicable, the text of the  disclosure language itself) prior to making such
disclosure and shall cooperate reasonably with the disclosing Party, at the
disclosing Party's expense, to the extent the disclosing Party may seek to
limit such disclosure, including, if  requested, taking all reasonable steps
to resist or avoid any such judicial or administrative proceedings referred to
above. If and to the extent, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver from the disclosing Party  after a request in writing
therefor is made by the receiving Party (such request to be made as soon as
reasonably practicable to allow the disclosing Party a reasonable amount of
time to respond thereto), the receiving Party or its  representatives or
their respective Affiliates are legally required as advised by legal counsel
in writing to disclose the disclosing Party's confidential information to any
tribunal to avoid censure or penalty, the receiving Party will limit  such
disclosure to that which is legally required and will use reasonable efforts
to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to
disclosing Party's confidential information that the receiving Party is so
required to  disclose, and thereafter the receiving Party may disclose such
information without liability hereunder.

 

 

 

77  

(e) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or Seller,
the other Party, in addition to all other available remedies, will be entitled
to injunctive relief to enforce the  provisions of this _Section 5.13_ in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

Closing Date.

 

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree there is no right of offset regarding

any other issue under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

78

promptly Transfer such Excluded Asset to Seller or its designated Affiliate or
cause such Excluded Liability to be assumed by Seller or its designated 
Affiliate, in each case for no additional consideration.

 

 

(c) If at any time prior to December 31, 2024, either Party discovers that (i)
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has a tangible embodiment of any
Transferred Intellectual Property or, to the  extent Buyer has an existing
license to such Intellectual Property Rights, Seller Licensed Intellectual
Property; or (ii) any tangible embodiment of Transferred Intellectual Property
(other than Joint IP) is held by Seller or any of its  Affiliates, in each
case, Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall promptly Transfer a tangible
embodiment of such Joint IP, all tangible embodiments of any such other
Transferred Intellectual Property or a tangible embodiment of any such 
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property, as applicable, to Buyer or its
designated Affiliate, in each case, for no additional consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither
Seller nor any of  its Affiliates shall be required to reduce any
Intellectual Property Rights into tangible embodiments (to the extent such
tangible embodiments do not already exist as of the Closing) or deliver any
Software not in their possession and  control.

 

 

(d) If at any time prior to December 31, 2024, either Party discovers that (i)
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has a tangible embodiment of any
Joint IP or (ii) any tangible embodiment of  Intellectual Property Rights
that are an Excluded Asset are held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, Buyer
or its applicable Affiliate will promptly Transfer a tangible embodiment of

a period of three (3) months after the Closing.

 

 

Section 5.17 _Mail and Other Communications_. Following the Closing, Seller

Business Days of the Execution Date, a completed Certificate Pertaining to
Foreign Interests, including all supporting documentation.

cash deposits or similar arrangements, as the case may be, on substantially

any Liabilities, causes of action, judgments and reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and fees and expenses including reasonable  attorney's fees and
disbursements (whether incurred in connection with the defense of Seller's
obligations under any Business Guarantees or in protecting the Supporting
Collateral or in enforcing its rights hereunder) sustained or incurred by 
Seller resulting from (i) any claim by any third party under such Business
Guarantees or upon such Supporting Collateral or (ii) any failure of Buyer to
comply with the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.19_ ; and

not have any continuing liability thereunder.

 

 

 

 

80  

 

 

 

Section 5.20 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

 


 

 

(a) Promptly     following the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall
take all action reasonably necessary to bind the RandW Insurance Policy. Buyer
shall execute and enter into the RandW Insurance Policy at or prior to the
Closing on terms  and in the form provided or made available to Seller at or
prior to the Execution Date, which such policy shall, for the avoidance of
doubt, include terms to the effect that the RandW Insurer waives its rights to
bring any claim  against Seller or any other Seller Indemnified Party by way
of subrogation, claim for contribution or otherwise (in each case, except in
the event of Fraud).

 


 

 

(b) After  the Closing, Buyer agrees that it will:

 


 

 

(i) comply    with the terms of any post-Closing deliverables set out in
the RandW Insurance Policy;

 


 

 

(ii) not    agree to any amendment, variation or waiver of the RandW
Insurance Policy (or do anything which has a similar effect);

Insurance Policy (or do anything which has a similar effect) to any Person
other than any Affiliate of Buyer; and

 


 

 

(iv) not  terminate or commute the RandW Insurance Policy or do anything which
causes any right under the RandW Insurance Policy not to have full force and
effect, in each case of _clauses    (i)-(iv)_ inclusive, in a manner that
materially and adversely affects Seller without Seller's prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 


 

 

Section 5.21 _Intercompany Accounts_. Immediately prior to the Closing, all
Intercompany Accounts shall be settled or otherwise eliminated in such a
manner as the Seller shall determine in  its sole discretion. Immediately
prior to the Closing, except for the Transaction Documents, all arrangements,
understandings or contracts, including all obligations to provide goods,
services or other benefits, between Seller or  its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Business, on the other hand, shall automatically be terminated
without further payment or performance and cease to have any further force and
effect, such that no party thereto shall have  any further obligations
therefor or thereunder.

 


 

 

 

81  

Section 5.22 _Financing_.

 


 

 

(a) Buyer shall use its, and  shall cause its controlled Affiliates to use
their, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the  Financing on the terms and subject only to the
conditions (including the market "flex" provisions) set forth in the
Commitment Papers contemporaneously with the Closing, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to (i)  maintain in effect the Commitment Papers,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with  the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Papers and (iii) if all of the
conditions to the Closing contained in _Article VI_ are satisfied or waived
(other than  those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing or will be satisfied or waived upon funding) and the
Marketing Period has ended, satisfy on or prior to the Closing Date all
conditions in the  Commitment Papers and the Definitive Agreements and comply
with its obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in
the Commitment Papers or the Definitive Agreements (other than the
consummation of the  Transaction and other than those that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment
Papers, including  using reasonable best efforts to cause the Lender Related
Parties to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to
fund the Financing. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller, permit any  termination of or amendment, supplement or modification
to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Commitment
Papers if such termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver
would (A) reduce the  aggregate amount of the Financing, (B) impose new or
additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to the
Financing in a manner that would  reasonably be expected to prevent, impede
or delay the funding of the Financing, (C) adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Papers
or (D) would otherwise reasonably  be expected to prevent or impede or delay
the funding of the Financing, provided, that at Closing, Buyer may reduce the
commitments under the Commitment Papers substantially contemporaneously with
the payment of all amounts due at  Closing to the extent Buyer is using funds
other than proceeds of the Financing to make such payments. Buyer shall
promptly deliver to Seller true and complete copies of any amendment,
modification, supplement, consent or waiver  to or under any Commitment
Papers promptly upon execution thereof.

 


 

 

(b) Buyer  shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller
prompt written  notice of (i) any actual or threatened breach, default,
termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Papers
and the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source  with respect to any breach, default, termination,
cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Papers, or (ii) the
occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the  ability of Buyer to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the Closing Date to the extent necessary to fund the Closing Cash
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after Seller delivers to
Buyer a written request,  Buyer shall provide any information reasonably
requested by Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence. If the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any  applicable market "flex" provisions)
contemplated by the Commitment Papers (other than solely as a result of
Seller's material breach of any covenant in this _Section 5.22_ ),    Buyer
shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, in
replacement thereof alternative financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in
an amount, when  combined with cash on hand of Buyer or otherwise available
to Buyer through its existing credit facilities, sufficient to consummate the
Transaction with (a) terms (including market "flex" provisions) (taken as a
whole) not  materially less favorable to Buyer (or its Affiliates) than the
terms set forth in the Commitment Papers, and (b) conditions (taken as a
whole) not less favorable to Buyer (or its Affiliates) than the conditions set
forth in the  Commitment Papers and (ii) promptly notify Seller of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. Upon any amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Commitment Papers in accordance
with the terms hereof  (including upon the execution of any commitment letter
or fee letter in respect of any Alternative Financing), the terms "Financing",
"Commitment Letter"; "Fee Letter" and "Commitment Papers" shall mean the
applicable Financing,  Commitment Letters, Fee Letters and Commitment Papers
as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced, and Buyer shall
deliver to Seller true and complete copies of the alternative debt financing
letters (including fee  letters that shall have fee or related information
redacted in a manner consistent with the Fee Letter delivered as of the date
of this Agreement). The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Buyer with
this _Section 5.22_ shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the Financing
is available.

 


 

 

 

82  

(c) Prior  to the Closing Date, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers,
employees and advisors to provide, to Buyer, such reasonable cooperation as
is  customary and reasonably requested by Buyer in writing in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing or a single offering of high-yield debt
securities under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") as contemplated under the Commitment Papers, including
using its reasonable best efforts to:

 


 

 

(i) as  promptly as reasonably practicable, furnish Buyer with the Required
Information, at Seller's sole cost and expense;

 


 

 

(ii) assist    Buyer with the preparation by Buyer and the Lender Related
Parties of, and use reasonable best efforts to provide (to the extent
reasonably available), customary information about Seller necessary for the
preparation of, materials  for rating agency presentations, bank information
memoranda, lender presentations, syndication memoranda and similar marketing
materials, memoranda or documents, and due diligence memoranda and schedules
to definitive financing  documentation, in each case to the extent such
materials relate to information concerning Seller;

 


 

 

(iii) execute    and deliver customary "authorization letters", authorizing
the distribution of information to prospective lenders (subject to
confidentiality obligations) and identifying any portion of such information
that constitutes material,  non-public information regarding Seller or its
securities, which shall be executed by an officer of Seller prior to Closing;

 


 

 

(iv) cause Seller's  independent accountants to participate in accounting due
diligence sessions and assistance in connection with providing customary
review of interim financial statements as provided in Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 100 and  comfort letters (which comfort letters shall not
address or opine on the preliminary financial information included in any
Recent Developments Section);

 


 

 

(v) upon the request of  Buyer, use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Trustee to deliver all instruments of termination, satisfaction or release
contemplated by Section 11.04 of the Indenture, dated as of April 17, 2017,
among Seller, Wells Fargo Bank,  National Association and the other parties
named therein to the extent applicable;

 


 

 

 

83  

(vi) provide, at least three  (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, all
documentation and other information about Seller as is reasonably required
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including the USA PATRIOT  Act, in each case to the extent
requested at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of the Closing; and

 


 

 

(vii) as promptly as  reasonably practicable, inform Buyer if Seller shall
have actual knowledge of any facts that (x) require the restatement of any
portion of the Required Information in order for such financial statements to
comply with GAAP or (y)  result in any of the Required Information no longer
being Compliant.

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary herein, none of such requested
cooperation provided in accordance with this _Section 5.22_ shall unreasonably
interfere with the normal business or  operations of Seller and in no event
shall Seller be required to (i) bear any expense, pay any commitment or other
fee, enter into any definitive agreement, incur any other liability, make any
other payment, be an issuer or other  obligor with respect to the Financing
or any offering of high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing in each case  prior to the Closing Date or
(ii) take any action to cause any condition to Closing set forth in this
Agreement to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement. In addition, nothing in this _Section 5.22_ shall require (u)
access to or disclosure of information that Seller determines would jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or violate any confidentiality  obligation of
Seller or its Subsidiaries, (v) except for the preparation and delivery of the
Carve Out Financial Statements, the preparation of any financial statements or
financial information that are not available to it and  prepared in the
ordinary course of its financial reporting practice, (w) any action that would
conflict with or violate Seller's articles of incorporation or by-laws or any
Law or result in, prior to the Closing Date, the  contravention of, or that
would reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Closing Date, a
violation or breach of, or default under, any contract, (x) any employee,
officer or director of Seller incurring any liability with  respect to any
matters related to the Financing, (y) Seller or its board of directors (or any
Subsidiary of Seller or its respective board of directors) to approve or
authorize the Financing or any documentation related thereto or  (z) Seller
or its counsel to provide any legal opinion in connection with the Financing.
For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor any of its officers, directors
or employees shall be required to execute or enter into or  perform any
agreement with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(except for customary "authorization letters", authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and identifying any  portion of such
information that constitutes material, non- public information regarding
Seller and its securities, which shall be executed by an officer of Seller
prior to Closing) and no directors of Seller shall be required to  execute or
enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing. Buyer
shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or its Representatives in  connection
with the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 5.22_ and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller and its Representatives from and against any and
all  losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Buyer pursuant to
this _Section 5.22_   and any information used in connection therewith,
except to the extent such losses arise out of or result from the fraud or
willful misconduct of Seller and/or any of its Representatives acting on
behalf or at its instruction. All  non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding Seller obtained by Buyer or its Representatives pursuant
to this _Section 5.22_ or otherwise shall be kept  confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ _,_ that Seller acknowledges
and confirms that Buyer or its Representatives may disclose such confidential
information to the Financing Sources subject to  compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and shall provide that
the Seller is a third party beneficiary thereof and shall satisfy the
confidentiality obligations of Regulation FD.

 


 

 

 

84  

(e) Seller hereby consents to  the use of its logos solely in connection with
the Financing; _provided_ that Buyer shall ensure that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or  reasonably likely to harm or
disparage Seller or Seller's reputation or goodwill and will comply with
Seller's usage requirements to the extent made available to Buyer prior to the
date of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(f) Buyer acknowledges and  agrees that the obtaining of the Financing, or
any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing.

 


 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything  to the contrary herein, a breach by Seller or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any obligation in this _Section 5.22_ shall
not constitute a breach of this Agreement or a  breach for purposes of this
_Article V_ or a breach of any condition set forth in _Section 6.2_ , unless
such  breach results in the Financing not being available to Buyer on the
Closing Date.

Section 7.4 _Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 


 

 

(a) In  the event that any claim or demand for which an indemnifying party
(an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any Indemnified Party
hereunder is asserted or  threatened against, or sought to be collected from,
any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event  more than ten (10) days
following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a Third Party Claim, provide
written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim, which
notice shall specify, in good faith, on a non-binding  basis, (i) the
provisions under this Agreement on which such claim by the Indemnified Party
is based, (ii) the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder
(to the extent then ascertainable in good faith) in  connection with such
Third Party Claim, (iii) any other remedy sought, in connection with such
Third Party Claim, and (iv) such other information as is believed in good
faith to be necessary to enable the Indemnifying Party to  assess the merits
of the claim, to act to preserve evidence and to make such provision as the
Indemnifying Party may consider necessary (including details of the legal and
factual basis of the claim, the evidence on which the  Indemnified Party
relies, any relevant time constraints relating to such claim and any other
material details pertaining to such claim) (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided  hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party has been prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice
Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,  that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to
control, and the Indemnified Party will be entitled to have control over, the
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim (and the reasonable  cost of
such defense and any Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim shall
constitute an amount for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder) if (1) the Third Party Claim involves a criminal 
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) if the Third
Party Claim seeks injunctive relief; (3) the Third Party Claim would
reasonably result in suspension or debarment of Buyer by a Governmental
Entity; (4)  any insurer, including the Insurer under the RandW Insurance
Policy, requires, as a condition to an Indemnified Party's eligibility to
recover insurance proceeds on account of such Third Party Claim, that such
insurer control  the matter; (5) the Indemnifying Party is not reasonably,
diligently or in good faith conducting a defense of the Third Party Claim (and
the Indemnifying Party is provided written notice thereof by Buyer and the
Indemnifying Party  does not cure such action or inaction within ten (10)
Business Days); or (6) the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by
legal counsel that a conflict of interest exists which, under applicable
principles of legal ethics,  would prohibit a single legal counsel from
representing both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in such
Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with and
assist the Indemnifying Party in  determining the validity of any claim for
indemnification by the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right at any time to revoke its determination that it will defend the
Indemnified Party if it determines  that indemnification is not required.

 


 

 

 

90  

(b) In  the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel
reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate
proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense.
Once the  Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing
at its  own cost. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle,
compromise or offer to compromise any Third Party Claim, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably, withheld,
conditioned  or delayed) only if settled solely by the payment of monetary
damages and the granting of releases, and _provided_ , that the settlement,
compromise or offer to settle or  compromise would not result in (i) the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would materially
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) a finding or  admission of a material violation of Law by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) a finding or
admission that would have an adverse effect in any material respect on other
claims made or threatened against the  Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates.

 


 

 

(c) If  the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise in writing, or if the
Indemnifying  Party does not have the right to so defend, the Indemnified
Party shall assume its own defense or settle such Third Party Claim and shall
consult with the Indemnifying Party regarding the strategy for defense or
settlement of such  claim, including with respect to the Indemnified Party's
choice of legal counsel; _it_ _being_ _understood_ _that_ the Indemnified
Party's right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be
adversely  affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. With
respect to any such Third Party Claim, if the Indemnifying Party agrees that
the Third Party Claim is within the scope of its obligations hereunder and
agrees to  hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against the amount of
any Losses resulting therefrom, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 7.2(b) and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, then the
Indemnified  Party shall obtain the Indemnifying Party's consent prior to any
settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed by the Indemnifying Party); _provided_ ,  _however_ , if the
Indemnified Party elects to proceed with the defense (including settlement or
compromise) of such Third Party Claim on its own, any settlement or 
compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of the amount of Losses incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Claim.

 


 

 

 

91  

(d) The  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim,
including by providing access to each other's relevant business records and
other documents  and employees.

 


 

 

(e) The  Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others  representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 


 

 

(f) The  Indemnified Party shall bear all of its legal fees, costs and
expenses arising out of or in connection with Third Party Claims unless such
expenses are Indemnifiable Legal Fees and Expenses.

 


 

 

Section 7.5 _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim
for indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall promptly, but
in no event more than ten (10) days following such Indemnified Party's
becoming aware of any fact, matter or  circumstance giving rise to such
Direct Claim, provide written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such Direct
Claim, which notice shall specify, in good faith, on a non-binding basis, (i)
the provisions under this Agreement on  which such claim is based, (ii) the
amount or the estimated amount of damages sought in connection with such
Direct Claim to the extent then ascertainable in good faith, (iii) any other
remedy sought in connection with such Direct  Claim, and (iv) such other
information as is believed in good faith to be necessary to enable the
Indemnifying Party to assess the merits of the claim, to act to preserve
evidence and to make such provisions as the Indemnifying  Party may consider
necessary (including details of the legal and factual basis of the claim, the
evidence on which the Indemnified Party relies, any relevant time constraints
relating to such claim and any other material details  pertaining to such
claim). The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for
indemnification by the Indemnified Party and shall keep the  Indemnifying
Party reasonably and promptly informed of any developments (including
additional information which may become available to it) in respect of such
Direct Claim.

 


 

 

 

92  

Section 7.6 _Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no Indemnifying Party shall have any Liability to an
Indemnified Party for any  consequential, speculative or punitive damages;
_provided_ that an Indemnified Party may recover (A) consequential damages to
the extent reasonably foreseeable and (B) any of  the other forms of damages
to the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction to be paid by the
Indemnified Party to an unrelated third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including the definition of "Losses"), in no event shall any Indemnified
Party be entitled to  recover lost profits, diminution in value, "multiple of
profits" or "multiple of cash flow", in each case, pursuant to an indemnity
claim under _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_.

 


 

 

Section 7.7 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 


 

 

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy, including  under the RandW Insurance Policy, or pursuant to any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, in each case
relating to the Third Party Claim or the Direct Claim shall be deducted
therefrom. The  Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable efforts to seek to
recover any such insurance, including under the RandW Insurance Policy, or other
proceeds from all third parties to the same extent such Party would if such
Losses  were not subject to indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that no
Indemnified Party shall be required to initiate or pursue any claim (i) in any
Action or (ii) against any  insurer if the Indemnified Party believes in good
faith that its insurance premiums would increase as a result of a successful
claim. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision
hereof, each Indemnified Party  and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute
upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate
in the prosecution of such  claims.

 


 

 

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment and Financial Statements_. No Indemnifying
Party shall be liable under or otherwise have any obligation under this
_Article VII_ in respect of any Loss if the fact, matter, event or
circumstance giving rise to the claim or on which it is based is included in
the reserves of the Most Recent Balance Sheet disclosed,  accrued or reserved
for in the Financial Statements or reduced Net Working Capital in the purchase
price adjustment set forth in _Section 2.6_.

 


 

 

(c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of  such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Article VII_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any)  of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of the Loss;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to
remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount greater than the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of the Loss.

 


 

 

(d) _Double Claims_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from
the Indemnifying Parties more than once in respect of the same Loss
(notwithstanding that such Loss may  result from breaches of multiple
provisions of this Agreement or of multiple Ancillary Agreements).

 


 

 

 

93  

Section 7.8 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified
Party the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder, in immediately
available funds, to an account  specified by the Indemnified Party no later
than five (5) Business Days following any Final Determination of such Loss and
the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor.

 


 

 

Section 7.9 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments made
by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim
pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ hereof shall be treated as
adjustments to the consideration paid pursuant to the Transaction for Tax 
purposes.

 


 

 

Section 7.10 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss (including by taking any actions
reasonably requested by an Indemnifying  Party in connection with the facts
and circumstances related to such Loss); _provided_ , _however_ , in no
event  shall any Indemnified Party be required to make any out-of-pocket
payment to any third party or commence any litigation to mitigate such Loss.
In the event an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss
as required  by this _Section 7.10_ , the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably would have been avoided
had the Indemnified Party made  such efforts. The Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Seller, on Seller's reasonable request, to minimize
Losses with respect to Excluded Liabilities; _provided_ ,  _however_ , Buyer
shall not be required to make any out‑of‑pocket payments (except for out-of-
pocket payments that Seller agrees to reimburse to Buyer), commence any 
litigation or make any material concessions to third parties in connection
with its obligations under this _Section 7.10_.

 


 

 

Section 7.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of Fraud, each Party
acknowledges and agrees that following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ , recovery under the RandW Insurance
Policy and Buyer's and Seller's rights pursuant to _Section 9.10(e)_   with
respect to post-Closing covenants shall provide the sole and exclusive
remedies arising out of or in connection with any breach or alleged breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made herein ( _it_
_being_ _understood_ _that_ except in the case of Fraud, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall seek recovery for such Losses from the RandW Insurance Policy
pursuant to _Section  7.7(a)_ and, solely to the extent coverage is not
provided under the RandW Insurance Policy, shall be entitled to recover such
Losses from Seller to the extent so entitled by this _Article VII_ ). The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies available in this _Article
VII_ supersede any other remedies available at law  or in equity, including
rights of rescission and claims arising under applicable Law. The Parties
covenant not to sue, assert any arbitration claim or otherwise threaten any
claim other than those described in this _Article VII_ as being available
under the particular circumstances described in this _Article VII_.

breach or condition is not curable or, if  curable, is not cured within the

and of no effect with no Liability to any Person on the part of any Party (or

notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (a) no such
termination  shall relieve any Party of any Liability or damages to the other

Fraud or any intentional breach of a covenant under this Agreement and (b) the
provisions  set forth in this _Section 8.2_ , _Article IX_ (Miscellaneous) 
and in the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 9.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by  both Buyer and Seller, or in the
case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.2_ , _Section 9.4_ , _Section
9.10_ and _Section 9.16_ , in each  case may not be amended, modified or
altered in any manner adverse to the Lender Related Parties without the prior
written consent of such Lender Related Parties. The conditions to the
obligations of either Party to consummate the  Transaction are for the sole
benefit of such Party and may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. No failure or delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege  hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein  provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

operation of Law or otherwise, without  the prior written consent of the
other Party, except that Buyer (a) may assign any and all of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries if such assignment would not reasonably be  expected to prevent
or materially delay the Closing or result in any greater cost or obligation
being imposed upon Seller than would otherwise be so imposed pursuant to this
Agreement and (b) may grant a security interest and/or a  collateral
assignment to its lenders of its respective rights arising under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
case, no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
hereunder. Any purported  assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

VII_ , and (b) as to the Lender Related Parties, for  the provisions of
_Section 9.2_ , this _Section 9.4_ , _Section  9.10_ and _Section 9.16_ ,
which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the parties specified
therein, this Agreement, together with the exhibits  and schedules hereto,

Agreement any remedy, claim, Liability, reimbursement, cause of action or
other right including any right to contract or any right to  employment or
continued employment.

 


 

 

 

97  

Section 9.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in the Transaction

Documents are consummated, all costs  and expenses (including fees and

does not intend to take, any action required to comply with any applicable
bulk sale, bulk transfer Laws or  similar Laws of any jurisdiction. Seller
and Buyer hereby agree to waive compliance with any such applicable bulk sale,
bulk transfer Laws or similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
Transaction.

 


 

 

Section 9.7 _Public Disclosure_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall issue an
initial press release in the form previously approved by the other Party, and
thereafter, Buyer and Seller each  shall use best efforts to notify each
other and consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Transaction and
prior to making any filings with any third  party and/or any Governmental
Entity (including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or  rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither
Party shall disclose any information regarding the  Transaction, except as
provided in this _Section 9.7_ or _Section 5.13_.

 


 

 

Section 9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits or
schedules hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and  supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND  WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND AS SET FORTH IN THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR ANY CERTIFICATE
DELIVERED PURSUANT HERETO OR THERETO, NONE OF BUYER, SELLER OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES MAKES OR RELIES ON ANY OTHER  REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE
AVAILABLE  BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTION, NOTWITHSTANDING
THE  DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR THE OTHER PARTY'S
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING; _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT NONE OF THE
FOREGOING SHALL OPERATE TO LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF ANY OTHER PERSON IN 
RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED ON OR ARISING OUT OF FRAUD. No
Party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged representation,
promise, inducement or statement of intention not contained herein or in any 
certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

 


 

 

 

98  

Section 9.9 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Party to any
other Party under this Agreement, or any Party under any of the Ancillary
Agreements, which obligation is  performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely
by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed,
satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

 


 

 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance_.

 


 

 

(a) This  Agreement, and all claims, disputes or causes of action (whether in
contract, tort or statute) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement  (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be
governed by,  and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to
applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application
of the laws of  another jurisdiction (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) would be required thereby.

 


 

 

(b) Each  Party agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in
respect of any claim based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement, the Transaction or the transactions contemplated by
any Ancillary  Agreement exclusively in the courts of the State of Delaware
and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ")  and solely in connection with claims
arising under or relating to this Agreement (i) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to the
laying of venue in any such action or  proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any Party, and (iv) agrees that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with  any such action or proceeding in the
manner provided in this _Section 9.10_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service  thereof.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding     the foregoing in this _Section 9.10_ , each Party
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any action, suit or proceeding,
whether at Law or in equity, whether in  Contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any of the Lender Related Parties arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Commitment Papers or the performance thereunder shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any  state or federal court sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan in the City and State of New York (whether a state
or federal court), and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) that any
such action, suit or proceeding, whether at  Law or in equity, whether in
Contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Lender Related Parties
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, (iii) not to bring or permit any  of their Affiliates to bring
or support anyone else in bringing any such action, suit or proceeding in any
other court, (iv) that the provisions of _Section 9.10(d)_ shall  apply to
any such action, suit or proceeding, and (v) that the Lender Related Parties
are express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 9.10(c)_.

 


 

 

 

99  

(d) EACH  PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY  ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO A LENDER RELATED PARTY UNDER THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY
HEREBY  ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE  FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS,
THE TRANSACTION  AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.10(d)_.

 


 

 

(e) The  Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the  Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to
any other  remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in equity. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller or any of its successors or
permitted assigns be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically the
remedy of  specific performance of the Commitment Papers against any Lender
Related Party.

 


 

 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one and the same  Agreement. In the event that any signature is
delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the
Party executing (or on whose  behalf such signature is executed) with the
same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an
original thereof.

 


 

 

Section 9.12 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 


 

 

(a) The  table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a
reference in this  Agreement is made to an Annex, Exhibit, Section or
schedule, such reference shall be to an Annex, Exhibit, Section or schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Each Exhibit and schedule attached
to this Agreement  constitutes a part of this Agreement and is incorporated
herein for all purposes.

 


 

 

 

100  

(b) If  a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall
have a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a
verb). The terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used
in the  plural and vice versa. The rule known as the ejusdem generis rule
shall not apply, and accordingly, general words introduced by the word "other"
shall not  be given a restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they are
preceded by words indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.
Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the  masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral
genders and vice versa. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without  limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or"  shall not be exclusive. Currency amounts referenced herein are
in U.S. Dollars. Any capitalized terms used in any schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to them as set forth in
this  Agreement. All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined
herein shall have the meanings given to them under the Accounting Principles,
or if not ascribed meaning by the Accounting Principles, GAAP.

 


 

 

(c) Except    as otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in
this Agreement to any Law include the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, in each case as amended, re-enacted, consolidated or replaced from
time to time and  in the case of any such amendment, re-enactment,
consolidation or replacement, reference herein to a particular provision shall
be read as referring to such amended, novated, re-enacted, consolidated or
replaced provision and  shall also include, unless the context otherwise
requires, all applicable guidelines, bulletins or policies made in connection
therewith.

 


 

 

(d) Whenever    this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number
shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified. Whenever any
action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then
such action may  be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business
Day.

 


 

 

(e) No  specific provision, representation or warranty in this Agreement
shall limit the applicability of a more general provision, representation or
warranty in this Agreement. It is the intent of the Parties that each
representation,  warranty, covenant and condition contained herein shall be
given full, separate and independent effect and that such provisions are
cumulative.

 


 

 

(f) The  Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the  Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

101  

(g) Each    of Seller and Buyer has or may have set forth information in
the Seller Disclosure Letter and Buyer Disclosure Letter, as applicable. The
fact that any item of information is disclosed in any section or subsection of
the Seller  Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent on its face (without reading any document referenced therein) based
on a plain  reading of such disclosure.

 


 

 

Section 9.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or  enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or  unenforceable, or the application of such provision,
covenant or restriction to any Person or any circumstance, is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, (a) a suitable and  equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the  application of such provision, covenant
or restriction to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or  enforceability of such provision, or the application
of such provision, in any other jurisdiction and the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and  shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 


 

 

Section 9.14 _Obligations of Buyer_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Buyer to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of  Buyer to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action.

 


 

 

Section 9.15 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of Seller and Buyer, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended  to or shall confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Without
limiting the foregoing, no direct or indirect  holder of any equity interests
or securities of either Seller or Buyer (whether such holder is a limited or
general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate of
either Seller or Buyer, nor any representative, or  controlling Person of
each of the Parties and their respective Affiliates, shall have any liability
or obligation arising under this Agreement or the Transaction.

 


 

 

 

102  

Section 9.16 _Lender Related Parties_. Subject, in each case, to the rights
and claims of Buyer under the terms of the Commitment Papers, (i) none of the
Parties nor any of their respective  Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall have any
rights or claims against, and this Agreement may not be enforced against any
of the Lender Related Parties in any way  relating to this Agreement, the
Commitment Papers or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
by the Commitment Papers, including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the performance of any financing  commitments of such Lender
Related Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or by the
Commitment Papers, whether at Law or equity, in Contract or in tort, or
otherwise and (ii) no Lender Related Party shall have  any liability (whether
at Law or in equity, in Contract or in tort, or otherwise) to any of the
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders under  this Agreement or
the Commitment Papers or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Commitment Papers,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the 
performance of any financing commitment. Seller and its Affiliates and
Representatives hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action (whether
in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity) against the Lender Related
Parties  that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
the Commitment Papers or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
