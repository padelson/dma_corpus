Closing Cash (which shall not be subject to further review, challenge or
adjustment, absent intentional and knowing fraud) for purposes of this Section
2.6, or (ii) setting forth a reasonably detailed explanation of those items in
the Buyer Calculation that the Seller disputes and a statement, with
reasonable detail as to the disputed



17







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







matters, of what the Seller believes is the correct calculation of Closing
Working Capital and Closing Cash (the "Seller Calculation"), which shall be in
the form of the Closing Statement and shall be calculated in accordance with
the Sample Net Working Capital and GAAP (except as otherwise set forth in the
Company Accounting Principles). The only disputes that the Seller may include
are disputes that (A) the Buyer Calculation was not calculated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement (including with respect to the Company
Accounting Principles and the Sample Net Working Capital) or that (B) the
Buyer Calculation includes mathematical errors. All items not disputed by the
Seller will become final and binding upon delivery of the Seller Calculation
for purposes of this Section 2.6. If the Seller fails to provide notice either
accepting or disputing the Buyer Calculation within the 45 day timeframe, the
Buyer Calculation will become final and binding on the Parties in all respects
for purposes of this Section 2.6. The Seller and the accountants engaged by
the Seller, if any, shall be entitled to review the Company's working papers,
trial balances and similar materials (including accountant work papers
following Seller's execution of a customary non-reliance letter) relating to
the preparation of the Buyer Calculation. The Company shall also provide the
Seller and its accountants with (1) the assistance of the Company's personnel
and (2) timely access, during the Company's normal business hours, to the
Company's personnel, properties, books and records for purposes of the
Seller's review of the Buyer Calculation, such access to be provided without
charge to the Seller. In no case shall the Buyer be required to afford the
Seller or any of its representatives access to the Company or its personnel or
books and records in a manner that unreasonably interferes with the Company's
business or operations.

(c) In the event that the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve any
disputes regarding the Closing Working Capital and Closing Cash within 45 days
after the date the Buyer receives the Seller Calculation, then such disputes
shall be referred to Duff and Phelps, LLC or, to the extent the Buyer or the
Seller has determined that a conflict of interest exists, any other
nationally-recognized accounting or valuation firm selected by mutual
agreement of the Buyer and the Seller (the "Settlement Accountants"). The
Seller and the Buyer shall instruct the Settlement Accountants to reach a
determination as to the disputed matters not more than 45 days after such
referral. Within 15 Business Days following such referral, the Buyer and the
Seller shall submit to the Settlement Accountants (and the other Party)
documentary materials and analyses that the Buyer or the Seller, as the case
may be, believes support its respective position relating to the disputed
matters set forth in the Buyer Calculation or Seller Calculation, but
excluding any work papers of independent certified public accountants. The
determination of the Settlement Accountants shall be final and binding for
purposes of this Section 2.6 and shall not be subject to further review,
challenge or adjustment, absent intentional and knowing fraud or a scrivener's
or mechanical error. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to authorize
or permit the Settlement Accountants to resolve any dispute by making an
adjustment to the Closing Working Capital and Closing Cash, as applicable,
that is outside of the issues or the range defined by the Buyer Calculation
and the Seller Calculation. In the event the Settlement Accountant agrees
entirely with either the Buyer Calculation or the Seller Calculation, then the
non-prevailing party shall be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of
the Settlement Accountant (and in such case the non-prevailing promptly shall
promptly (i) pay to the Settlement Accountant all such fees and expenses then
due and owing and (ii) if applicable, reimburse the prevailing party for any
portion of such fees and expenses already paid by the prevailing party);
otherwise, the fees and expenses of the Settlement Account shall be split
proportionally, as determined by the Settlement Accountant, between the Buyer
and the Seller based on the difference (when compared to each other) between
each Party's calculation and the final resolution by the Settlement Accountant
(and each party shall promptly pay to the Settlement Accountant such Party's
proportionate share of such fees and expenses then due and owing). The date on
which the Final Working Capital and Final Cash are agreed or finally
determined is referred to as the "Determination Date".



18







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







(d) No later than five Business Days after the Determination Date, the Seller
or the Buyer, as the case may be, shall make the following payments to the
applicable Person via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated in writing by the Person entitled to receive
such payment:

(i) (A) if the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital, then the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, deliver to the
Seller an amount equal to the difference and (B) if the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than the Final Working Capital, then the Seller shall
deliver to the Buyer an amount equal to the difference; and

(ii) (A) if the Final Cash is greater than the Estimated Cash, then the Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, deliver to the Seller an amount equal to
the difference and (B) if the Estimated Cash is greater than the Final Cash,
then the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer an amount equal to the difference.

2.7 Earn-Out.

(a) Earn-Out Payment. In addition to the Purchase Price, if in any Earn-Out
Period Filtrexx EBITDA equals or exceeds $5,000,000, the Buyer shall pay to
the Seller an amount equal to the product of (i) 0.4, multiplied by (ii) the
Filtrexx EBITDA achieved during such Earn-Out Period (the "Earn-Out Payment");
provided, that the maximum aggregate amount of all Earn-Out Payments that the
Buyer shall be obligated to pay shall be $40,000,000. If, in any Earn-Out
Period, Filtrexx EBITDA is less than $5,000,000, then no Earn-Out Payment
shall be payable with respect to such Earn-Out Period.

(b) Timing of Payment.

(i) Earn-Out Statement. During the Earn-Out Period, the Buyer shall maintain
separate books and records with respect to its operation of Filtrexx,
consistent with Filtrexx's past practice, sufficient to enable the parties to
accurately determine Filtrexx EBITDA for purposes of the calculation of the
Earn-Out Payment. Within 60 days following the end of each Earn-Out Period,
the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a statement (the "Earn-Out
Statement") setting forth the Buyer's determination and calculation of
Filtrexx EBITDA during the Earn-Out Period and the potential Earn-Out Payment
to the Seller, if any (the "Earn-Out Calculation"). The Earn-Out Calculation
shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP and prepared on a basis consistent
with the calculation of Filtrexx EBITDA set forth on Exhibit D.

(ii) Earn-Out Objection Statement. The Buyer shall afford the Seller and its
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to (A) the
Company's books, records and other documents (including work papers,
schedules, financial statements and memoranda) relating to or used in
connection with the Buyer's preparation and calculation of such Earn-Out
Statement and (B) the Company's accountants and employees and shall cause such
Persons to cooperate with the inquiries of the Seller and its representatives,
in each case, for the purpose of verifying such Earn-Out Statement; provided,
that the Seller and its representatives, as applicable, execute and deliver
customary non-reliance letters at the request of the Buyer's and the Company's
accountants. The Buyer will not charge the Seller or its representatives for
such access. Within 45 days following receipt of an Earn-Out Statement, the
Seller may deliver written notice (the "Earn-Out Objection Statement") to the
Buyer of any disagreement that the Seller may have as to such Earn-Out
Statement. Such Earn-Out Objection Statement shall set forth in reasonable
detail each disputed



19







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







item (each, an "Disputed Earn-Out Item"), the amount disputed and the Seller's
basis for such disagreement, together with supporting calculations and the
Seller's position as to the proper calculation of the Disputed Earn-Out Items,
and the Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items contained
in the Earn-Out Statement and the calculations of the items set forth therein.
The failure of the Seller to deliver such Earn-Out Objection Statement during
such 45 day time period will constitute the Seller's acceptance of the Earn-
Out Statement as determined by the Buyer and the amounts and calculations set
forth therein shall be deemed to be final and binding upon the Parties.

(iii) Resolution of Dispute. If the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve
any disagreement as to any Disputed Earn-Out Item within 45 days following the
Buyer's receipt of an Earn-Out Objection Statement, then the amounts in
dispute will be referred to the Settlement Accountant. The Seller and the
Buyer shall instruct the Settlement Accountant to reach a determination as to
the disputed matters not more than 45 days after such referral. Within 15
Business Days following such referral, the Buyer and the Seller shall submit
to the Settlement Accountant (and the other Party) documentary materials and
analyses that the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, believes support
its respective position relating to the Disputed Earn-Out Items. The
determination of the Settlement Accountant shall be final and binding for
purposes of this Section 2.7 and shall not be subject to further review,
challenge or adjustment, absent intentional and knowing fraud. Nothing herein,
however, shall be construed to authorize or permit the Settlement Accountant
to resolve any dispute by making an adjustment to an Earn-Out Payment that is
outside of the issues or range proposed by the Buyer and the Seller. In the
event the Settlement Accountant agrees entirely with either the Buyer or the
Seller, then the nonprevailing party shall be responsible for all of the fees
and expenses of the Settlement Accountant (and in such case the nonprevailing
promptly shall promptly (A) pay to the Settlement Accountant all such fees and
expenses then due and owing and (B) if applicable, reimburse the prevailing
party for any portion of such fees and expenses already paid by the prevailing
party); otherwise, fees and expenses of the Settlement Accountant shall be
split proportionally, as determined by the Settlement Accountant, between the
Buyer and the Seller based on the difference (when compared to each other)
between each Party's calculation and the final resolution by the Settlement
Accountant (and each party shall promptly pay to the Settlement Accountant
such party's proportionate share of such fees and expenses then due and
owing). The term "Final Earn-Out Statement," as used in this Agreement, shall
mean a definitive Earn-Out Statement accepted (or deemed accepted) by the
Seller or agreed to by the Seller and the Buyer in accordance with Section
2.7(b)(ii) or a definitive Earn-Out Statement resulting from the
determinations made by the Settlement Accountant in accordance with this
Section 2.7(b)(iii) (in addition to those items theretofore accepted by the
Seller or agreed to by the Seller and the Buyer).

(iv) Payment of Earn-Out Payment. Subject to Section 11.11, the Buyer shall
pay the Earn-Out Payment (if any) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. dollars to such account designated by the Seller within five
Business Days after the Final Earn-Out Statement is accepted or finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(iii).

(c) Earn-Out Covenants. During each Earn-Out Period, the Buyer shall (i)
operate Filtrexx and its business in good faith; (ii) not knowingly and
intentionally take any action with respect to such operations, one of the
purposes of which is to negatively prejudice the Seller's ability to achieve
the Earn-Out Payment, it being understood that the Buyer's mere recognition
that a given action may prejudice the Seller's ability to achieve the Earn-Out
Payment shall not constitute having a "purpose" to do so; and (iii) not cause
Filtrexx to enter into any transactions with any Subsidiaries or Affiliates of
the Buyer (including the Company)



20







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







other than on an arm's-length basis. Within 30 days following each three-month
period during the Earn-Out Period, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a
statement showing (A) the applicable Filtrexx EBITDA calculations for such
period, which shall include supporting detail for such calculations, and (B)
the amount of the projected Earn-Out Payment calculated using Filtrexx EBITDA
achieved as of such date (each, a "Quarterly Report").

(d) Acceleration of Earn-Out Payment. Without limiting the Seller's other
rights that it may have under this Agreement, at Law or in equity, if any of
the following events (each, an "Earn-Out Acceleration Event") occur during any
Earn-Out Period, then one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum Earn-Out
Payment shall be deemed to be earned in full, without further action of the
Parties, and the Buyer shall notify the Seller at least 10 Business Days prior
to the occurrence of any of the following events and, subject to Section
11.11, shall pay such Earn-Out Payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars to such account designated by the Seller:

(i) the Buyer dissolves or liquidates Filtrexx or sells, transfers, exchanges,
leases or otherwise disposes of, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of Filtrexx,
except that the Earn-Out Payment will not be accelerated in the case of a
sale, transfer, exchange, lease or other disposition in a single transaction
or series of related transactions, to an Affiliate of the Buyer or a third
party acquirer of all or substantially all of the assets of Filtrexx so long
as the Affiliate or third party acquirer, as applicable, shall (A) agree to,
during the remainder of the Earn-Out Period, maintain and carry on the
business conducted by Filtrexx prior to such sale or transfer with respect to
such assets acquired as if such Affiliate or third party acquirer had acquired
all of the outstanding stock of Filtrexx and (B) assume in writing all of the
Buyer's obligations under this Section 2.7 such that the terms of this Section
2.7 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such Affiliate or third party acquirer, as
applicable, to the same extent as they apply to the Buyer; provided, that the
Buyer shall remain fully responsible for all of its Affiliate's obligations
under this Section 2.7;

(ii) Filtrexx consummates a merger or consolidation into or with any other
Person, or the Buyer consummates a sale, exchange or other disposition of the
Equity Interests of Filtrexx, or other similar transaction, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, in each case, such that the
Buyer no longer owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding Equity
Interests of Filtrexx following such transaction or series of related
transactions, except that the Earn-Out Payment will not be accelerated in the
case of a sale, transfer, exchange, lease or other disposition in a single
transaction or series of related transactions to, or a merger or consolidation
with, an Affiliate of the Buyer or a third party acquirer of Filtrexx so long
as the Affiliate or third party acquirer, as applicable shall assume in
writing all of the Buyer's obligations under this Section 2.7 such that the
terms of this Section 2.7 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such Affiliate or
third party acquirer, as applicable, to the same extent as they apply to the
Buyer; provided, further, that the Buyer shall remain fully responsible for
all of its Affiliate's obligations under this Section 2.7.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, a merger, consolidation, sale, exchange or
other disposition of the Buyer or the equity interests of the Buyer, as
applicable, or a transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Buyer shall be deemed not to be an Earn-Out
Acceleration Event.

2.8 Tax Treatment and Allocation. The Parties agree that for federal Tax
purposes this Transaction is treated as a sale of the assets held by the
Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries (not including the Equity Interests of
Conwed NV, which are being separately sold pursuant to the Conwed NV Purchase
Agreement). The Parties agree that the Purchase Price, including any debt or
obligations that are properly included in the Purchase Price for Tax purposes,
shall be allocated among the assets of the Company and the U.S. Subsidiaries
in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of the Code. No later than
90 days following the Closing, the Buyer shall propose to the Seller the
allocation provided for in the preceding sentence, and if the Buyer and the
Seller are able to agree upon such allocation, or any revisions thereto, the
Buyer and the Seller shall reflect the agreed-upon allocation for all
applicable Tax purposes, including for purposes of IRS Form 8594. If the Buyer
and the Seller are unable to agree upon such allocation, the Buyer and the
Seller shall each be permitted to independently determine the allocation to be
used by such Party for applicable Tax purposes.

2.9 Tax Withholding. The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable to the Seller under this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith
under the Code or any provision of Law relating to Taxes, as determined by the
Buyer and all such withheld amounts shall be remitted to the applicable Taxing
Authorities promptly following the date of payment. In any case where
withholding or deduction is required, the Buyer shall use reasonable efforts
to provide notice to the Seller at least 15 days prior to withholding (or, if
later, promptly after the Buyer becomes aware of its obligation to withhold)
any amount pursuant to this Section 2.9 (other than in respect of any payroll
taxes), and the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to reduce or avoid such
withholding where possible. Despite having amounts so withheld, the Seller
shall be treated as though it had received the full amounts to which it is
otherwise entitled.

purpose of which does not relate to Taxes).

(i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to include or
accelerate the recognition of any item in income, or exclude or defer any

Buyer and the Seller to this Agreement only and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon or be construed to grant any rights, as a

Agreement be deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee
benefit plan, as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise
to limit the right of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Buyer to amend,
modify or terminate any such employee benefit plan. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.3 shall require the Buyer, the Company or
any Subsidiary to continue the employment of any Assumed Employee for any

Employee.

such entities as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of or on behalf of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, shall
survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
Indemnitees, unless such modification is required by Law. In addition, the
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company, or the Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to pay any expenses of any Indemnitee under this Section 7.4, as incurred to
the



46







ACTIVE 218042945

fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided, that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Buyer, for the six year period after the Closing Date, shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Company and the Subsidiaries to contain
provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of
certain liabilities of directors, managers, officers, employees and agents and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in such
Organizational Documents, which provisions, in each case, shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

(c) Each of the Buyer, the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Indemnitee shall
cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense
of any Legal Proceeding as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

(d) Prior to Closing, the Acquired Companies shall purchase a fully prepaid
directors' and officers' liability insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance
program with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date
(such coverage to last for six years after the Closing Date and to be on terms
and conditions and for an amount not materially less favorable to the Acquired
Companies' directors, managers and officers currently covered by such
insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof).

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.4: (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by Contract or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer, the Company, and each
Subsidiary (as the case may be) shall assume all of the obligations thereof
set forth in this Section 7.4.

(g) The obligations of the Buyer, the Company, each Subsidiary or any of their
successors or assigns under this Section 7.4 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 7.4 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.4 applies shall
be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.4).

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this Section
7.4 shall not override or otherwise impair a Buyer Indemnified Party's right
to seek indemnification in accordance with Article XI, and, if any Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under Article XI
(without regard to the limitations contained in Article XI) with respect to
the same matter, no Indemnitee will be entitled to be exculpated, indemnified
or reimbursed, or receive advancement of any expenses, under the

Organizational Documents of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Buyer, this
Agreement or otherwise, with respect to such matter.

7.5 Communications With Employees. Prior to Closing, no officer, director,
employee, agent or representative of any Acquired Company, the Seller or
Leucadia shall make any communication to any employees of any Acquired Company
regarding the terms of the Transactions or directly or indirectly relating to
any post-Closing employment matter, in each case, that is inconsistent with
the communications plan previously provided to the Seller and Leucadia by the
Buyer without the advance written approval of the Buyer (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

7.6 Specified Annual Bonus Amounts.

(a) If the Closing Date occurs during 2016:

(i) The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer, no later than three Business Days
prior to Closing, an updated version of Schedule 1.1(a) for purposes of
reflecting a more accurate estimate of the bonuses that would be payable to
the Assumed Employees for fiscal year 2016. Subject to the Buyer's approval of
such updated Schedule (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), such updated Schedule 1.1(a) shall replace the Schedule 1.1(a)
attached hereto as of the date of this Agreement and such updated Schedule
1.1(a) shall be deemed to be Schedule 1.1(a) hereto for all purposes
hereunder.

(ii) The Buyer shall cause the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries to pay
to each Assumed Employee listed on Schedule 1.1(a) the annual bonus to which
each such Assumed Employee is entitled for fiscal year 2016, if any (such an
amount with respect to such Assumed Employee, the "Actual Annual Bonus
Amount"). If the Actual Bonus Amount is less than the Specified Annual Bonus
Amount, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, refund to the Seller
an amount equal to (A) the Specified Annual Bonus Amount for such Assumed
Employee minus (B) (1) the Actual Annual Bonus Amount plus (2) the amount of
the employer portion of any Taxes associated with the payment of the Actual
Annual Bonus Amount, if any. If the Actual Bonus Amount is more than the
Specified Annual Bonus Amount, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount
equal to the absolute value of (A) the Specified Annual Bonus Amount for such
Assumed Employee minus (B) (1) the Actual Annual Bonus Amount plus (2) the
amount of the employer portion of any Taxes associated with the payment of the
Actual Annual Bonus Amount, if any. The Seller shall, and the Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries to, pay or refund all
amounts payable to the Buyer or the Seller pursuant to this Section 7.6(a)(ii)
promptly, and in any event within 30 days, following the Buyer's and the
Company's payment of the Actual Annual Bonus Amounts for all of the Assumed
Employees listed on Schedule 1.1(a). Any refund payments required to be made
pursuant to this Section 7.6(a)(ii) shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Seller
or the Buyer, as applicable.

(b) If the Closing Date occurs in 2017, the Seller shall pay the Actual Annual
Bonus Amount and the amount of the employer portion of any Taxes associated
with the payment of the Actual Annual Bonus Amount, if any, prior to the
Closing Date.

8.1 Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Each of the Parties shall cooperate with one another and use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including
furnishing all information required under the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws)
to effect promptly all necessary filings and to obtain all consents, waivers
and approvals necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each of the Seller and
the Buyer shall provide to the other copies of all correspondence between it
(or its advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust Entity relating to the
Transaction or any of the matters described in this Section 8.1. Each of the
Seller and the Buyer shall promptly inform the other of any oral communication
with, and provide copies of written communications with any Governmental
Entity regarding any such filings or any such transaction. No Party hereto
shall independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without
giving the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, prior notice of the
meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the Buyer
and the Seller will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto
relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Law.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 8.1, the Parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to any Governmental Antitrust Entity information and
documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper
or advisable to permit consummation of the Transaction, including filing any
notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act
as promptly as practicable and in no event later than (i) five Business Days
after the date hereof for filings required under the HSR Act (which shall
include a request for early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act) and (ii) 15 Business Days after the date hereof for filings under
any Other Antitrust Law, and thereafter to respond promptly to any request for
additional information or documentary material that may be made and use
reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, and approval, consent, authorization or clearance under any
Other Antitrust Law. Fees associated with filings required by the HSR Act or
Other Antitrust Law shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty
percent (50%) by the Seller.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Antitrust Entity with respect to the Transaction under the HSR Act and any
Other Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require,
the Buyer to proffer to, or agree to, sell, license or dispose of or hold
separate and agree to sell, license or dispose of before or after the Closing,
any assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of the Buyer,
any of the Acquired Companies or any of its or their respective Affiliates (or
to consent to any sale, license, or disposition, or agreement to sell, license
or dispose of, by any Acquired Company, any of their assets or businesses) or
to agree to any changes or restrictions in the operations of any such assets
or businesses or commence or participate in any litigation, offer or grant any
accommodation or undertake any obligation or Liability; and the Seller,
Leucadia and the Acquired Companies shall not take or agree to take on any
such action without the Buyer's prior written consent.

(d) The Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or
agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division thereof if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay
in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of
any Governmental Antitrust Entity necessary to consummate the Transactions or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase
the risk of any Governmental Antitrust Entity entering an Order prohibiting
the consummation of the Transactions; (iii) increase the risk of not being
able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) delay in any

ACTIVE 218042945

8.2 Consents. The Buyer acknowledges that certain consents, approvals and
waivers with respect to the Transaction may be required from third parties,
including Governmental Entities and parties to Contracts. The Buyer further
acknowledges that such consents, approvals and waivers have not been obtained
and that certain of such notices and applications may not have been filed, in
each case, as of the date hereof. Prior to the Closing, subject to Section
8.1, the Buyer shall cooperate with the Company in any reasonable manner in
connection with the Company seeking or obtaining any such consents, approvals
and waivers and filing any such notices or applications. Any fees or
consideration paid to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested or required, except to the extent otherwise provided herein, shall
be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer, on the one hand, and fifty percent
(50%) by the Seller, on the other hand. None of the Seller, Leucadia or any of
the Acquired Companies shall agree to make any concession with respect to
obtaining a consent, approval or waiver that would impose any obligation upon
the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing or adversely affect the
timing or viability of consummating the Transactions without the prior written
consent of the Buyer.

8.3 Fulfillment of Closing Conditions. At and prior to the Closing, each Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill, and shall cooperate with
each other to fulfill, as soon as practicable the conditions specified in
Article IX to the extent that the fulfillment of such conditions is within its
or his control. In connection with the foregoing, each Party will (a) refrain
from any actions that would cause it to be unable to deliver the certificates
required pursuant to Sections 9.2(e) or 9.3(c), (b) execute and deliver the
applicable agreements and other documents referred to in Article IX, (c)
comply with all applicable Laws in connection with its execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Transactions, (d) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain in a timely manner all necessary waivers,
consents and approvals, and make any notice or application filings, in each
case, as required under any Laws, Contracts or otherwise, including any
Required Consents, and (e) use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions.

8.4 Public Announcements. From and after the date hereof, except as may be
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange or stock market, the Seller, the
Acquired Companies or the Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates, may
issue any press releases or otherwise make any public statements with respect
to the Transactions so long as the party making the release or announcement
provides the other party with reasonable advance time to comment on such
release or announcement.

8.5 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Seller,
at its own expense, shall prepare or cause to be prepared (in a manner
consistent with prior practice) all income Tax Returns the Company and the
Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The
Company and the Subsidiaries shall timely file such Tax Returns as so
prepared.

(b) Tax Returns for Periods Beginning on or Before and Ending After the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed any income Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries
for Tax periods which begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the
Closing Date ("Straddle Periods"). The Buyer shall permit the Seller to review
and comment on such Tax



51







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







Returns prior to filing and shall not file such Tax Returns without the
consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For purposes of Section 11.2(a)(vi), the amount of
Taxes attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period through the end of the
Closing Date, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are not based upon or related to income or receipts or expenses, shall be
deemed to be the amount of Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period. In the case of all Straddle
Period Taxes not described in the preceding sentence, the portion of the Taxes
associated with the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be apportioned between the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date and the portion of the period beginning after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Taxes attributable to any action prohibited by Section
8.5(h) shall be included in the Tax period beginning on the day after the
Closing.

(c) Amended Tax Returns. The Buyer shall not, nor shall it permit or cause any
of its Affiliates, the Company, or any of the Subsidiaries to, amend, file,
refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to Tax periods that begin
prior to the Closing Date without consent of the Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer and the Seller shall and shall cause
their Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other, in connection with the filing of any Tax Returns
(including the completion of any IRS Forms 5471) and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include (i) the
retention and (upon the other's request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any Tax Return, audit, litigation
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder; (ii) assistance to the other party in preparing any Tax
Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in
accordance with this Section 8.5 and in connection therewith, providing the
other party with any necessary powers of attorney; and (iii) cooperating fully
in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes with Taxing
Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary.

(e) Transfer Taxes. All transfer (including real property transfer and equity
interest transfer), documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller when due. All necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes will be prepared and filed by the
party required to file such Tax Returns under applicable Law.

(f) Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds (and interest, if any, thereon) or benefit of
crediting an overpayment or over-accrual of Taxes (and interest, if any,
thereon) that are received by or credited to the Buyer, the Company, or any of
the Subsidiaries, with respect to a taxable period or portion of the Straddle
Period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the
Seller, and the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid over to the Seller any
such refund or benefit of crediting of an overpayment (and any interest



52







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







with respect thereto); provided, that such refund or benefit of crediting an
overpayment is not reflected in and taken into account as a Current Asset in
the calculation of Working Capital. Such payment shall be paid over to the
Seller within 60 Business Days after receipt or benefit thereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, all Tax refunds (and interest, if any, thereon) or benefit
of crediting an overpayment or over-accrual of Taxes (and interest, if any,
thereon) with respect to a taxable period or portion of the Straddle Period
that begins on or after the day after the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the Buyer, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

(g) Deductions. The Buyer and the Seller agree that payments made with respect
to Indebtedness of the Company, Seller Transaction Expenses and Transaction
Bonus Amounts, to the extent such payments give rise to Tax deductions, Tax
Losses, and Tax credits or otherwise may offset taxable income or Tax under
applicable Law, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
considered to arise in the taxable period that ends on the Closing Date, and
shall be claimed by the Seller in such period, and provisions of this
Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent therewith.

(h) No Closing Date Tax Actions. Neither the Buyer nor its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing) shall cause to
be made any extraordinary transaction or event on the Closing Date that could
result in any increased Tax Liability for which the Seller would be
responsible (through payment, indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, or
otherwise); provided, however, that the Buyer, in its sole discretion, shall
be permitted to make elections under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect
to Conwed NV.

(i) Tax Mitigation. The Parties agree to use reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Person or take such other actions as
may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could otherwise
be imposed with respect to a taxable period or portion of the Straddle Period
ending on or before the Closing Date.

(j) Responsibility for Post-Closing Taxes. The Buyer shall be responsible for
all Taxes of the Company and all Subsidiaries that are attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period that begins the day after Closing, and all Tax
periods that begin after the Closing.

(k) Conwed NV Tax Matters. The Seller shall, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 11.4(b), control any Tax audits or other proceedings with
respect to Belgian Tax matters and Conwed NV (or, to the extent relevant, any
direct or indirect shareholder of Conwed NV) for any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period, and the Buyer shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to cooperate with respect to any such audit or
proceeding, including by providing any power of attorney or other
authorization permitting the Seller to so act. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds resulting from such audit or
proceeding, consistent with Section 8.5(f), and shall be permitted to control
any such audit or proceeding even if no liability for Tax, or accompanying
indemnification obligation on the part of the Seller, is expected; provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be entitled to settle any such audit or
proceeding if such settlement adversely affects the liability for Taxes of any
Buyer Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

8.6 Certain Restrictive Covenants.

months following the Closing Date, in the case of Section 8.6(a)(i), Section
8.6(a)(ii) and Section 8.6(a)(iii) or (2) 30 months following the Closing
Date, in the case of Section 8.6(a)(iv) (either such period, the "Restricted
Period"), the Seller, Leucadia and each of their respective Affiliates (other
than the Persons identified on Schedule 8.6(a)) (each, a "Restricted Party"
and together, the "Restricted Parties") shall not, directly or indirectly, as
agent, employee, employer, consultant, distributor, representative,
stockholder, manager, partner or in any other capacity:

(i) employ or engage, or recruit or solicit for employment or engagement (as a
consultant or otherwise) any of the management employees of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries identified on Schedule 8.6(a)(i) (provided, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit solicitation or hiring of such employees (A)
through the use of general solicitations, including through media
advertisements, job boards or employment search firms, in the ordinary course
of business that are not targeted at such employees, (B) who are terminated by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the commencement of such
solicitation or hiring, or (C) who voluntarily terminated their employment or
engagement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and have accordingly
ceased to be employed or retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for at least six months prior to the commencement of such solicitation or
hiring);

(ii) make (or cause to be made) to any Person any disparaging or derogatory or
otherwise negative or false comments or statements concerning the Company, the
Subsidiaries or the Buyer, or any of their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, partners, shareholders or agents (or any of their
products or services or respective business reputation or personal
reputation);

(iii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the relationship of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates with any
Specified Business Contact or encourage, induce, attempt to induce, solicit or
attempt to solicit (on his, her or its own behalf or on behalf of any other
Person) any Specified Business Contact to terminate or adversely modify its
business relationship with the Company or its Subsidiaries; or

(iv) in the Restricted Area, own, manage, engage in, operate, control, consult
with, maintain any interest in or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of, any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship,
partnership or other form, whether by Contract or otherwise, that engages in
the Business (a "Restricted Business"); provided, however, that the
restrictions contained in this Section 8.6 shall not restrict the acquisition
of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Equity Interests of any
publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business. As used herein,
"Restricted Area" shall mean the entire world.

(v) The Parties acknowledge that to the extent a breach of this Section 8.6
has occurred, the court may, in its discretion, award as a nonexclusive remedy
to the Buyer an extension of the applicable Restricted Period by the length of
time during which such Restricted Party was in breach of the terms of the
applicable provisions as determined by the court.

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this
Section 8.6 are reasonable (including as to scope, time and area), not unduly
restrictive of each applicable Restricted Party's rights, supported by
adequate consideration and necessary protection of the immediate interests of
the Buyer, and any violation of these restrictions may cause immediate and
irreparable injury to the Buyer for



54







ACTIVE 218042945

which there may be no adequate monetary damages. In addition, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions contained in this Section 8.6 are
essential elements of this Agreement and that but for these restrictions, the
Buyer would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions,
and each Restricted Party agrees not to challenge the validity or importance
of such restrictions. If any court determines that any provision of this
Section 8.6 is unenforceable, such court will have the power, and is hereby
requested in such event, to reduce the duration or scope of such provision, as
the case may be, or terminate such provision until, in such reduced form, such
provision shall be enforceable. It is the intention of the parties hereto that
the foregoing restrictions shall not be terminated, unless so terminated by a
court, but shall be deemed amended to the extent required to render them valid
and enforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of
this Section 8.6 in the jurisdiction of the court that has made the
adjudication.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 8.6 shall be
deemed to bind any Affiliate of the Seller (including, without limitation, any
individuals, Jefferies Group LLC or any of its subsidiaries and any
subsidiaries of Leucadia engaged in asset management (solely with respect to
such asset management business)) other than the Restricted Parties.

8.7 Exclusivity. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1,
the Seller, the Company, and Leucadia shall not, and shall direct their
managers, officers, employees, investment bankers and other Affiliates and
representatives not to, (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the

all or substantially all of the assets or Equity Interests, equity or debt
financing, joint venture, merger, reorganization, consolidation,
recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution, equity
exchange, sale of all or substantially all of the Equity Interests, sale of
all or substantially all of the assets or similar business transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Sale Transaction") or (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding,

Transaction. If the Seller, any Acquired Company, or Leucadia receives any
offer, proposal or inquiry with respect to a Sale Transaction, they shall
promptly inform the Buyer of such offer, proposal or inquiry by written notice
(such notice to include all material details of such offer, proposal or
inquiry).

8.8 Business Confidential Information. The Seller and Leucadia each
understands and acknowledges that such Person has had access to and has
learned (a) information proprietary to the Company and the Subsidiaries,
including Intellectual Property and Technology, policies and strategies,
details of client and consultant contracts, operations methods, product
development techniques, business plans and all other confidential information
with respect to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) other
confidential or proprietary information of the Buyer or its Affiliates
obtained by such Person prior to the Closing or otherwise pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "Business Confidential Information"). The Seller and
Leucadia hereby agrees that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, until the five year anniversary of the Closing Date, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, such Person (i) will keep
confidential all Business Confidential Information, and (ii) will not,

third party or use any Business Confidential Information in any competing
manner, in each case, other than for the benefit of the Buyer, the Company or
the Subsidiaries in performance of such Person's duties as an officer or
employee of the Buyer, the Company or a Subsidiary. The restrictions contained
in this Section 8.8 shall not apply to any information which (x) is at the
Closing Date or thereafter becomes generally

use reasonable efforts to give reasonable advance notice of such requirement
to the Buyer to enable the Buyer or any of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy with respect to such
permitted disclosure, or (z) becomes available to the Seller or Leucadia on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries, provided, that such source is not known to the Seller or
Leucadia (as applicable) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

8.9 Related Party Accounts and Agreements. On or before the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies shall: (a) cancel all loans or other accounts between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Related Person,
on the other hand; and (b) take all actions necessary to terminate all rights
and obligations under all Contracts (other than as to any restrictive
covenants contained therein that bind any current or former owners, officers
or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary), business relationships or
commitments between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and any Related
Person, on the other hand (the "Related Party Agreements"). Following the

Affiliates), on the one hand, nor the Seller or any other Related Person, on
the other hand, shall have any Liability to the other with respect to any
Related Party Agreement (other than any rights to indemnification contemplated
by Article XI).

extent the Losses mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to this
Section 11.3).

11.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim may be asserted by notice to (i) the Seller, in respect of a claim for

respect of a claim for which indemnification is sought under Section 11.3(a),
in each case, prior to expiration of the applicable survival period for the
provision or obligation forming the basis thereof.

(b) In the event of any Indemnification Claim (including an audit with respect
to Taxes), the indemnified party subject to such claim shall promptly cause
written notice of the assertion of such Indemnification Claim of which it has
knowledge to be forwarded to (i) the Seller, in respect of an Indemnification
Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 11.2, and (ii) the Buyer,
in respect of



62







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







an Indemnification Claim for which payment may be sought under Section 11.3.
The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any
such Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party's obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate or otherwise deal with
any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified by it
hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the indemnifying
party shall not be entitled to assume control of an Indemnification Claim, and
the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the indemnified party (to the extent the Indemnification Claim is
determined to be indemnifiable under this Article XI), if (A) the
Indemnification Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment or allegation, (B) the Indemnification Claim
seeks injunctive or other equitable relief, or (C) the Indemnification Claim
involves a claim by a customer or supplier of the indemnified party or a
Governmental Entity that, if adversely determined, would impair in any
material respect the financial condition, business, operations, reputation or
prospects of the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume control of an
Indemnification Claim pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, unless
impermissible under applicable Law or deemed impermissible by a Governmental
Entity, the indemnifying party may participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party elects to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it hereunder, it
shall within 30 days (or sooner, if the nature of the Indemnification Claim so
requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the
indemnifying party does not elect to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification Claim and its
costs of doing so shall constitute Losses for purposes of Section 11.2 or
11.3. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its
own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; provided, however,
that such Person shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the indemnifying party (but
subject to Section 11.5 and 11.6) if, (1) so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (2) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any
appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any
Indemnification Claim. The Parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.4 to the
contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall,
without the written consent of the Seller or the Buyer as applicable (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or
compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or consent to entry
of any judgment unless the claimant provides an unqualified release of the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party from all Liability in respect of
the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (x) a settlement
offer solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant
and the third party claimant is willing to issue a full release of both the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party, and (y) the indemnifying party
notifies the indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying party's
willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable
limitations of Sections 11.5 and 11.6, pay the amount called for by such
offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such Indemnification Claim, free of
any participation

ACTIVE 218042945

by the indemnifying party, at its own expense, and the amount of any ultimate
Liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying
party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A)
the amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to
accept plus any other Losses of the indemnified party relating to such
Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement
offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to
such Indemnification Claim (but in any case, subject to Sections 11.5 and
11.6).

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at an
agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder, the indemnified
party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing
by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such
matter.

11.5 Certain Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XI, neither the Seller nor
the Buyer shall have any indemnification obligations for Losses under Section
11.2(a)(i), Section 11.2(a)(ii) or Section 11.3(a)(i), (i) for any individual
item, or group of items arising out of the same or series of similar facts,
conditions or events, where the aggregate amount of Losses relating thereto is
less than the Sub-Basket and where the aggregate amount of Losses relating
thereto is equal to or exceeds the Sub-Basket, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
indemnification for the full amount of such individual item (or group of items
as set forth above), subject to clause (ii) below, and (ii) unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses on a cumulative basis suffered by Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be,
exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess. In no
event shall the aggregate indemnification for which the Seller is obligated
under Section 11.2(a)(i) and Section 11.2(a)(ii) exceed the Cap, provided that
the limitations on indemnification set forth in this Section 11.5(a) shall not
apply to Losses based upon or resulting from the failure of any of the
Fundamental Representations of the Company or of the Seller or the Specified
Representations to be true and correct in all respects at and as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Buyer nor the
Seller shall be liable, other than with respect to intentional and knowing
fraud, for any amount in excess of the Purchase Price plus the Conwed NV
Enterprise Value.

(c) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall make any claim for indemnification under
this Article XI in respect of (i) any amount to extent that it is specifically
reflected in and taken into account as a Current Liability in the calculation
of Working Capital, including any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.6 or (ii) any Loss to the extent such Loss arises from the same set
of facts with respect to which the Indemnitee previously asserted its
indemnification rights under this Article XI and recovered its Losses
thereunder.

11.6 Calculation of Losses.

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article XI shall (i) be net of any Tax benefits actually recognized as a cash
reduction in Taxes or by the indemnified



64







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







party and amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance
policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of any Tax or expenses
incurred in connection with such recovery), (ii) be net of any amounts
recovered by the indemnified party from Collateral Sources, (iii) take into
account all increases in Taxes payable by the indemnified party as a result of
the receipt of the indemnity payment, and (iv) to the extent not previously
taken into account in computing the amount of the Loss, all increases in Taxes
payable by the indemnified party for all affected taxable years and periods as
a result of the event giving rise to such Loss. If amounts are recovered from
a Collateral Source after an indemnifying party makes a payment to or on
behalf of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article XI, the net proceeds
thereof shall promptly be remitted to the Indemnifying Party that made such
payment. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no right of subrogation to any
rights of any party hereunder shall accrue or inure to the benefit of any
Collateral Source.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any punitive
damages of such other Person, except to the extent payable to a third party.

11.7 Materiality. The Parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that, except
for the representations set forth in Section 3.8(b), for the purpose of
determining the amount of the applicable Losses, qualifications as to
materiality or material adverse effect (or any similar qualification) in any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein or in any other document
contemplated by this Agreement shall be ignored.

11.8 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All payments made pursuant to
this Article XI shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

11.9 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, other than with respect to
the Parties' rights and remedies provided in Section 2.6 and Section 2.7(b) or
any intentional and knowing fraud claim and subject to Section 11.11, the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy for any breach or failure to be true and
correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any
representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the Conwed NV Purchase Agreement, shall be indemnification in accordance with
this Article XI. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parties hereby waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, on behalf of themselves and,
in the case of the Buyer, on behalf of its applicable designee or designees
signatory to the Conwed NV Purchase Agreement, other than with respect to
Section 2.6 and Section 2.7(b) and any intentional and knowing fraud claim and
subject to Section 11.11, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contribution, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against any other Party (or Buyer's applicable designees signatory to the
Conwed NV Purchase Agreement), as the case may be, arising under or based upon
any Law to the extent arising out of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 11.9 shall not operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions of Article II concerning the (a) resolution of
certain disputes relating to the determination of the Purchase Price or any
Earn-Out Payment between the Parties and/or by a Settlement Accountant and (b)
the rights of the Parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific
performance or injunctive relief).

11.10 Guarantee of the Seller Indemnification Obligations. Leucadia, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Buyer, as primary obligor
and not merely as surety, the full and timely

payment and performance of the Seller's covenants and agreements in this
Article XI (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This is a guarantee
of payment and performance, and not merely of collection, and Leucadia
acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no
amendment, modification, release or extinguishment of the Seller's obligations
or Liabilities, whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise,
shall affect the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee;
provided, however, that a Delay of Payment must have occurred before any Buyer
Indemnified Parties may seek to enforce a Guaranteed Obligation against
Leucadia. The Seller and Leucadia hereby waive, for the benefit of Buyer, (a)
any right to require the Buyer, as a condition of payment or performance by
Leucadia, to proceed in any Legal Proceeding against the Seller or pursue any
other remedies whatsoever after a Delay of Payment has occurred and (b) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by any Law that limit the Liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, other than defense of payment and performance in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations. Leucadia understands that the Buyer is relying
on this guarantee in entering into this Agreement. Leucadia hereby represents
and warrants, on behalf of itself only, that (i) it has all requisite power
and authority or capacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and
(ii) this Agreement represents (assuming the valid authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Buyer) the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Leucadia, enforceable against Leucadia in accordance with its
terms. The foregoing representations and warranties of Leucadia shall survive
until the expiration of the Seller's obligations pursuant to this Article XI.

11.11 Setoff. In addition to any rights of setoff that the Buyer or any of the
other Buyer Indemnified Parties may have at common law or otherwise, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall have the
right, exercisable by delivery of written notice to the Seller, to deduct from
any Earn-Out Payment that would be otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.7
any sum that is or may be owed to the Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified
Party under this Article XI as a result of a Permitted Setoff Event; provided,
that if the amount of any Loss relating to any such Permitted Setoff Event is
determined by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction not to be owed to
the Buyer or the other Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms hereof,
such setoff amount shall be promptly funded by the Buyer pursuant to Section
2.7 or otherwise cancelled, as applicable, if no amount is yet owed to the
Seller pursuant to Section 2.7.

12.3 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer and
the Seller shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions the Company shall not bear any of the
fees and expenses in connection with such matter.

12.4 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the
foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto shall
be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of
Laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

12.6 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the County
of New Castle, Delaware for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby. Each of the Parties agrees to commence any such action, suit or
proceeding either in a federal court located within the County of New Castle,

County of New Castle, Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought

TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR

Parties (who shall be third-party beneficiaries of Article XI), the
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in this
Agreement are for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted
successors and assigns, and they shall not be construed as conferring

any rights or remedies on any Persons other than the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

12.9 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents and the documents,
instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered
pursuant hereto, including the Exhibits and Schedules, set forth the entire
understanding of the Parties hereto with respect to the Transaction. All
Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be and hereby are
specifically made a part of this Agreement. Any and all previous agreements
and understandings between or among the Parties regarding the subject matter
hereof, whether written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement, except for
the Non-Disclosure Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms.

12.10 Captions. All captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

12.11 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable
the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

12.12 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties agrees that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof and that each Party
shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. In furtherance of and without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, (a) each of
the Seller and the Buyer shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches of, or enforce compliance with, those covenants
of Buyer that require Buyer to consummate the Transactions or of Seller that
require Seller to consummate the Transactions, as the case may be, and (b)
from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of, or enforce compliance with, those
covenants of the Seller and Leucadia set forth in Article VIII that
contemplate performance after the Closing.

12.13 Conflicts and Privilege.

(a) The Buyer agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior representation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries by Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP and Snell and
Wilmer L.L.P. (together, the "Firms" and, each, a "Firm"), each Firm shall be
allowed to represent the Seller or any of its Affiliates in any matters and
disputes (or any other matter), including in any matter or dispute adverse to
the Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary that relates to this Agreement and
the Transactions (a "Dispute"). The Buyer hereby (i) waives any claim it has
or may have that such Firm has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in any such representation; (ii) agrees that, in the
event that a Dispute arises after the Closing between the Buyer, the Company
or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, such Firm may represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in
such Dispute even though the interests of Seller or its Affiliate may be
directly adverse to the Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries and even though
such Firm may have represented the Company or the Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such Dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Company or the Subsidiaries; provided, however,



70







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







that no such representation shall constitute a waiver of any attorney-client
privilege between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
either Firm, on the other hand, and the Seller shall cause either Firm, as
applicable, acting as its counsel to not take any actions or engage in any
representation that would affect or be deemed to be such a waiver, it being
understood that the determination of whether such a waiver has occurred (or is
reasonably likely to occur) will be subject to the Seller's reasonable
determination and nothing in this Section 12.13 shall be construed to prevent
the Seller from taking any action with respect to which the Seller has
reasonably determined that no such waiver will, or is reasonably likely to,
occur as a result thereof.

(b) The Buyer is aware that, in connection with the Firms' representation of
the Company and the Subsidiaries, the Firms are or may be in possession of
information of the Company and the Subsidiaries including communications
between either Firm and the Company or any of its Subsidiary relating to the
Transactions (such documents in the possession of either Firm shall be
referred to as the "Communications"). The Buyer agrees that the foregoing
shall not be asserted as a basis to claim that a Firm cannot represent the
Seller or its Affiliates in any matter, including in a Dispute. The Buyer
further agrees that, following the Closing, the Seller may use such
Communications so long as the Seller reasonably determines that the use of
such Communications shall not waive (and is reasonably likely not to waive)
any applicable privilege, and that the Buyer will not (i) request from either
Firm or (ii) use or intentionally access any of the Communications in
connection with any Dispute or potential Dispute; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall prevent the Buyer from requesting, using or
accessing any Communications in connection with document production requests
or discovery in any Legal Proceeding by an unrelated third party so long as
such Communications are not subject to exclusion from such document production
request or discovery on the basis of attorney-client privilege. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 12.13 or in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable privileges or protections that can
or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any Communications to any third
party, and the Seller shall not take any action, or cause the Firms to take
any action, that the Seller reasonably determines would reasonably be expected
to waive any such privilege or protection as to any third party.

12.14 Interpretation.

(a) The meaning assigned to each term defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term and vice
versa, and words denoting either gender shall include both genders as the
context requires. Where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other
grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning.

(b) The terms "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit
or Schedule, such reference is to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement as amended unless otherwise specified.

(d) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation,"
unless otherwise specified.



71







ACTIVE 218042945

(e) A reference to any Party to this Agreement or any other agreement or
document shall include such Party's predecessors, successors and permitted
assigns.

(f) Reference to any Law means such Law as amended, modified, codified,
replaced or reenacted, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(g) Any document, list or other item shall be deemed to have been "made
available" to Buyer for purposes of this Agreement only if such document, list
or other item was posted prior to the date of this Agreement in the electronic
data room established by Seller in connection with the Transactions before the
date hereof.

(h) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. Any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring
this Agreement to be construed or interpreted against any Party by virtue of
the authorship of this Agreement shall not apply to the construction and
interpretation hereof.

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Buyer, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or any of the
Subsidiaries' operations prior to the Closing Date, and nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give the Company or Seller, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Buyer's or its subsidiaries'
operations. Prior to the Closing Date, each of Buyer and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its subsidiaries' respective operations.

(j) Except to the extent a shorter time period is expressly set forth herein
for a particular cause of action, Actions hereunder may be brought at any time
prior to the expiration of the longest time period permitted by Section
8106(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any cause of action for
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall
accrue, and the statute of limitations period shall begin to run, upon
discovery of such breach by the Party seeking to assert such cause of action.

12.15 Further Assurances. After the Closing, from time to time, as and when
requested by any Party, each Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other reasonable actions, as such other
Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
Transactions, including, in the case of Seller, executing and delivering to
the Buyer such assignments, deeds, bills of sale, consents and other
instruments as the Buyer or its counsel may reasonably request as necessary or
desirable for such purpose, and in the case of the Buyer, providing the Seller
with the information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Seller in
order to enable the Seller and its Affiliates to comply with their reporting
and compliance obligations under applicable Laws as they relate to the
Acquired Companies for the period prior to Closing and/or the Transactions.

12.16 Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to Seller, as primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the full
and timely payment and performance of the Buyer's covenants and agreements in
this Agreement (collectively, the "Buyer Guaranteed Obligations"). This is a
guarantee of payment and performance, and not merely of collection, and Parent
acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and no
amendment, modification, release or extinguishment of the Buyer's obligations
or Liabilities, whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise,
shall affect



72







ACTIVE 218042945

* * *







the continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee; provided,
however, that a Delay of Payment must have occurred before any Seller
Indemnified Parties may seek to enforce a Buyer Guaranteed Obligation against
Parent. Parent hereby waives, for the benefit of the Seller, (a) any right to
require the Buyer, as a condition of payment or performance by Parent, to
proceed in any Legal Proceeding against the Buyer or pursue any other remedies
whatsoever after a Delay of Payment has occurred and (b) to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or
afforded by any Law that limit the Liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties, other than defense of payment and performance in full of the Buyer
Guaranteed Obligations. Parent understands that the Seller is relying on this
guarantee in entering into this Agreement. Parent hereby represents and
warrants that (i) it has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement represents (assuming the
valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other
parties hereto) the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
against Parent in accordance with its terms. The foregoing representations and
warranties of Parent shall survive until the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations have
been performed or paid and satisfied in full.
