12

connection with the Merger in such form as is required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, Delaware Law.

(b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be agreed by the
parties that is specified in the Certificate of Merger).

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges
and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as
provided under Delaware Law.

 

Section 2.03. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, _Section_ __ _
2.03(c)_, or _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive (i) $6.30 in cash, without interest (the "Cash
Merger Consideration") and (ii) one (1) contractual contingent value right
pursuant to the CVR Agreement (a "CVR"), in each case, without interest
thereon ((i) and (ii) collectively, the "Merger Consideration");

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

(c) each share of Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of Parent
(other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the
same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and

 

(d) (i) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and (ii) each share of preferred stock of Merger Subsidiary
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and, together with the shares described
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.04. _Surrender and Payment_.

 



13

    

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Uncertificated Shares"). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares (the "Payment Fund").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal which shall be in
reasonable and customary form and instructions and which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.09_ or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be required to deposit any funds related
to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit is required
pursuant to the CVR Agreement.

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.09_) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this 
_Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or
more Uncertificated Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
an "agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of
each such Uncertificated Share, and the Uncertificated Shares of such holder
shall forthwith be cancelled.

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered on the books of the Company, it
shall be a condition to such payment that either such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or
such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(e) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the

 



14

    

 stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Article 2_.

(f) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ in respect of any Dissenting Shares
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, provided that Parent shall return
such portion of the Merger Consideration to the Exchange Agent to the extent
that the holder of such Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect
to such shares.

Section 2.05. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.03_,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_) and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of Delaware Law (such shares being referred to collectively
as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under
Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment
of the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
Delaware Law;  _provided_ that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal,
pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares of Company Common Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.03(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate
formerly representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as
the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common
Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice,
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 262 of Delaware Law, and Parent shall have the opportunity and
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

by an individual other than a Specified Holder or other officer or employee of

an "Out of the Money Option"), shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment, if any, from Parent with respect to each
Share subject to the Out of the Money Option upon each Valuation Point which
occurs after the Effective Time, equal to (A) the amount by which the
Per Share Value Paid exceeds the exercise price payable per Share under such
Out of the Money Option, less (B) the amount of all payments previously
received with respect to such Out of the Money Option pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.06(b)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any

or greater than $8.30 and (y) Company Stock Options that are not vested as of
the effective time and which do not vest pursuant to the terms of such Company

Effective Time, delivered to the Company and not revoked Non-Competition
Agreement or (2) an officer or employee of the Company who is not a Specified

Corporation or its Affiliate to, and the Surviving Corporation or its

applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to In the Money Options or
Out of the Money Options through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving

by Parent in the case of any payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(b)_ in
respect of Out of the Money Options through the Rights Agent); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent there is not a withholding obligation
with respect to the Company Stock Options, the consideration payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.06(a)(i)_ with respect to such Company Stock Options
shall be paid in the manner described in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ through the
Payment Fund rather than this _Section_ __ _ 2.06(c)_.

treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person

(c) As of its filing date, and if amended or supplemented prior to the date of

financial officer, as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at
the time of filing or submission of each such certification, such
certification was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
None of the Company, any current executive officer of the Company or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any former executive officer of the Company has
received written notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or
questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of
such certifications made with respect to the Company SEC Documents filed

Section 4.08. _Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim

prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may

sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance that (i)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) receipts and expenditures are
executed in accordance with the authorization of management, and (iii) any

material weaknesses identified in managements assessment of internal controls
as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2018 (nor has any such deficiency or
weakness been identified since such date).

 

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the
individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

principal financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act
with respect to such reports.

thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, and at the time such
stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting,
the Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 4.09_ will not apply to statements or omissions included
in the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to the Company in
writing by Parent specifically for use therein.

Section 5.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers
required to carry on its business as now conducted. Since the date of its

Parent and Merger Subsidiary subject only to the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, which will occur
immediately following the execution of this Agreement. This Agreement

requirements of the HSR Act and the Foreign Competition Laws, compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any

or supplement thereto, at the time the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the

Proceeding pending against or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
or affecting, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair Parents or Merger
Subsidiarys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order

prevent, materially delay or materially impair Parents or Merger
Subsidiarys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.07. _Financing_. At the Closing, Parent shall have sufficient cash,
available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to

includes termination rights for the Third Party that made the Superior
Proposal on terms no less favorable to the Company than the terms set forth in
this Agreement, all from a Third Party capable of performing such terms, or
(C) a Superior Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or
otherwise submitted to the Company or any of its Representatives that (I)
provides for consideration to the Companys stockholders consisting only of
cash, (II) is not subject to any financing condition (and if financing is
required, such financing is then fully committed to the Third Party that made
the Superior Proposal), (III) is reasonably capable of being completed on the
terms proposed without unreasonable delay and (IV) includes termination rights
for the Third Party that made the Superior Proposal on terms no less
favorable to the Company than the terms set forth in this Agreement, all from
a Third Party capable of performing such terms. Unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the Company agrees that
it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the Company any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of
the Companys stockholders with respect to the Merger at the Stockholder
Meeting. The notice of such Stockholder Meeting shall state that a resolution
to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger will be considered at the
Stockholder Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or voted upon
at the Stockholder Meeting without Parents prior written consent (other than
a non-binding, advisory vote to approve or disapprove certain compensation
that may become payable to the Companys named executive officers in
connection with the completion of the Merger).

(b) Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.03_: (i)
the Company Board (as it may be constituted on the date hereof) shall
unanimously recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (the
"Board Recommendation") at the Stockholder Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement
shall include the Board Recommendation; and (iii) neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company and Parent
shall prepare jointly and the Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement (but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement) and as soon as practicable thereafter use its
reasonable best efforts to mail to its stockholders the Proxy Statement (but
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the clearance of the
Proxy Statement by the SEC or after receipt of confirmation from the SEC that
it will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement) and all other proxy materials
for the Stockholder Meeting, and if necessary in order to comply with
applicable securities laws, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so
mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies. The
Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information
concerning the Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the
Proxy Statement. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement before such document
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall include in such document any comments reasonably proposed
by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof,

 



47

    

 provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and
advise Parent and its counsel of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) received from the SEC or
its staff, provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
the Companys proposed response to such comments, consider in good faith any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel, and provide Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC.

 

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, and the Company shall instruct each such Representative
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take any
action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal
or the making of any inquiry, offer or proposal that could reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (other than informing Persons
of the provisions set forth in this Agreement); (ii) conduct or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information
relating to the Company to, afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company to or otherwise cooperate in any way, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any
Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, any Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) amend or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company; (iv)
approve any transaction under, or any Third Party becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law; or (v) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach
its obligations hereunder, or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the foregoing restrictions by any Representatives of the Company shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ by the Company. The
Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to cease immediately and
cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of
its Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions
or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date
hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in
possession of non-public information in respect of the Company that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy (and confirm
destruction of) all such information.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_,
prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through any Representative, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with
any Third Party that has made in writing after the date of this Agreement
(and not withdrawn) a bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from or arise out of a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_, and that
the Company Board believes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
and (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party non-public information
relating to the Company pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with
terms no less favorable

 



48

    

 to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
containing additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply
with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ (a copy of which
confidentiality agreement shall be promptly and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours of execution by the Company provided for informational
purposes only to Parent), but in each case under the preceding clauses (i)
and (ii), only if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Board will not be in violation of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03_ if, in connection with the preceding clause (i), the
Company and its Representatives contacts such Third Party or Third Parties
solely to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal solely
to determine whether it constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal. 

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) or (ii) of  _Section_ __ _ 6.03(b)_, unless the Company shall have
notified Parent in writing at least one (1) Business Day before taking such
action that it intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after it obtains
knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, offer or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. In such notice, the Company
shall identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication, offer, proposal or request. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or
request, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price
and other material terms thereof. The Company shall promptly provide Parent
with any non-public information concerning the Companys business, present or
future performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to
any Third Party that was not previously provided to Parent.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to
make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or
exchange offer for the Company Common Stock within ten (10) Business Days
after Parent so requests in writing, (iv) make any public statement
inconsistent with the Board Recommendation or (v) resolve or agree to take any
of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, an "Adverse Recommendation
Change"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, at any time prior to the
Stockholder Approval,

(i) the Company Board, following receipt of and on account of a Superior
Proposal, may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_, but only if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall
not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, unless (A) the Company promptly
notifies Parent, in writing at least four (4) Business Days before making an
Adverse

 



49

    

 Recommendation Change (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to take such
action with respect to a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company attaches to such
notice the most current version of the proposed agreement or a reasonably
detailed summary of all material terms of any such Superior Proposal (which
version or summary shall be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the
Third Party making the Superior Proposal, (C) the Company negotiates, and
causes its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, during the Notice
Period, with Parent in good faith and to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement that Parent, in its discretion, proposes; it
being agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period,
there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including
any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period
subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material
revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions); and (D)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent during such period, if any, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and
the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under Applicable Law; and

(ii) the Company Board may, in response to a material fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition
Proposal occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement) that was not
known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as
of or prior to the date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any
Acquisition Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set
of circumstances, an "Intervening Event") make an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the
Company Board to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that
no fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances shall constitute
an Intervening Event if such fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances resulted from or arose out of the announcement, pendency or
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this clause _(ii)_ unless the Company has provided to
Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent
that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the facts
underlying the Company Boards determination that an Intervening Event has
occurred, and the reasons for the Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable
detail, and during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such
a manner that obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the Intervening Event, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes
to make such adjustments; it being agreed that in the event that, after
commencement of the Notice Period, there are any material changes to the
Intervening Event, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Notice Period

 



50

    

 subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material
revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions).

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall prevent the Company
Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that any such disclosure
(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms its Board Recommendation (x) in such
communication or (y) within two (2) Business Days after requested to do so by
Parent.

 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, the Company shall give to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties, books, records, Contracts,
Governmental Authorizations, documents, directors, officers and employees of
the Company during normal business hours, furnish to Parent and its
Representatives such financial, Tax and operating data and other information
as such Persons may reasonably request (including the work papers of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP upon receipt of any required consent from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), and instruct its Representatives to cooperate
with Parent and its Representatives in its investigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access
to any such properties or information or such disclosure would, based on the
advice of such partys counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work-product doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable
to such information. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of the Company.

 

Section 6.05. _Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, subject to
Applicable Law, the executive officers of the Company, including but not
limited to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, shall consult in good
faith on a regular basis with Parent to report material (individually or in
the aggregate) operational developments, the status of relationships with
customers, resellers, partners, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors
and others having material business relationships with the Company, the status
of ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent
pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that no such
consultation shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto)
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of:

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



51

    

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any Proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Sections 4.12_ , _4.13_ or _4.15_
 as the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or breach of covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof
that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_ not to be satisfied.

Section 6.06. _401(k) Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately preceding
the Effective Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan
and shall provide Parent evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been
terminated pursuant to an action by the Company Board. In the event that
Parent requests that the Companys 401(k) plan be terminated, Parent shall
offer participation in Parents tax-qualified defined contribution plan not
later than 120 days following the Effective Date to each Continuing Employee.

 

Section 6.07. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company who are
employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who
continue to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any
Affiliate thereof) during such one-year period (the "Continuing Employees")
(i) base salary and base wages no less favorable than such base salary and
base wages, (ii) short-term incentive compensation opportunities (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any equity-based compensation) no less favorable
in the aggregate than such short-term incentive compensation opportunities and
(iii) benefits (including severance benefits) no less favorable in the
aggregate than such benefits, in each of the above clauses (i) (ii) and
(iii), as provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to Continuing Employees,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the service of each
such Continuing Employee with the Company and its ERISA Affiliates prior to
the Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate,
levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan) and vesting under each compensation, vacation, fringe
or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their ERISA Affiliates, but not including any equity
compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements (collectively, the
"Parent Benefit Plans") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes
eligible to participate, but solely to the extent service was credited to such
employee for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent such credit would not
result in a duplication of benefits.

 



52

    

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to
waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his commencement of participation in such
Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term disability and
life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent permitted under
the terms and conditions of Parents applicable insurance contracts in effect
as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that for purposes of clarity, to the extent
such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on periods of
employment _Section_ __ _ 6.07(a)_ shall control; and provide each Continuing
Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such
Continuing Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in
satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such
Parent Benefit Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such
expenses were recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company
Employee Plan. 

(d) In the event that the Closing occurs prior to the Company paying annual
cash incentives in respect of 2019, Parent shall pay to each Continuing
Employee a cash bonus in respect of 2019 in an amount equal to the cash bonus
amount payable under the applicable Company annual cash incentive plan or
program based on the greater of target or actual level of achievement of
the applicable performance criteria, with such level of achievement (i)
measured during the period from and including January 1, 2019 through and
including the end of the calendar month immediately preceding the month in
which the Closing Date occurs; (ii) determined by the Compensation Committee
of the Company Board in the ordinary course of business (including, without
limitation, adjustments to account for non-recurring items), and
without regard to any costs and expenses associated with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring events that would not
reasonably be expected to have affected the Company in the absence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) annualized, on a
straight line basis, through the end of the quarter in which the Closing Date
occurs. Such bonus amounts shall be paid, less any required withholding Taxes,
on or about the date on which the Company would normally pay bonuses in the
first calendar quarter of 2020 and in no event later than March 15, 2020 (or,
if earlier, in accordance with the applicable Company severance policy or
program or employment agreement upon a qualifying termination of employment
occurring prior to such date).

(e) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including any employees, former
employees, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or any beneficiary
thereof or any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this  _Section_
__ _ 6.07_ shall be deemed to amend any Parent Benefit Plan or to require
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to continue or
amend

 



53

    

 any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and any such plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

Section 6.08. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the CVR Agreement,
then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, and their respective
Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 6.09.  _CVR Agreement_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall authorize and duly adopt, execute and deliver, and will ensure that a
duly qualified Rights Agent executes and delivers, the CVR Agreement, subject
to any reasonable revisions to the CVR Agreement that are requested by such
Rights Agent (provided that such revisions are not, individually or in the
aggregate, detrimental or adverse, taken as a whole, to any holder of a CVR).
Parent and the Company shall cooperate, including by making changes to the
form of CVR Agreement, as necessary to ensure that the CVRs are not subject to
registration under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws.

 

Section 6.10. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and Parent
shall be jointly and severally liable with Merger Subsidiary for the due and
timely performance and satisfaction of each of its obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 6.11. _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote any shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholder Meeting, and will vote or cause
to be voted the shares of Merger Subsidiary held by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement.

Section 6.12. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently
covered by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of
such policy in effect on the date hereof (with insurance carriers having at
least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance); _provided_ that in
satisfying its obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4,800,000) (the
"Maximum Premium"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Maximum Premium, then the Surviving 

 



54

    

 Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the
Surviving Corporations judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that the amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed the
Maximum Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies
in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
the Company pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between
the Company and any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"); and (ii) any indemnification
provision and any exculpation provision and advancement of expenses provision
set forth in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such obligations shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.
If, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
any Indemnified Party delivers to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as applicable, a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification
under any of the provisions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii) above, then the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_.

 

Section 6.13. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, the delivery of required
notices to, and the obtaining of required consents or waivers from, third
parties and the execution and delivery of

 



55

    

 any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_, each of Parent and the Company shall provide or cause
to be provided as promptly as practicable to Governmental Authorities with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws (each such
Governmental Authority, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and
documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority or necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report
form and related material required under the HSR Act and any additional
consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (but in no event more than ten (10)
Business Days from the date hereof except by mutual consent confirmed in
writing) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws; and
use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or
advisable to obtain prompt approval of consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to litigate or participate in the
litigation of any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by
any Governmental Authority or appeal any Order challenging or seeking to make
illegal, delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
any damages in connection therewith, or seeking to prohibit or limit in any
respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates of all or any portion of
the business, assets or any product of the Company or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or to require any such Person to dispose of, license (whether

transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 9.01_ or in any other
manner permitted by law.

 

Section 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 9.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by each other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any
other electronic means designed to preserve the original

 graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures.

 

Section 9.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the CVR Agreement
(including any annexes, schedules and exhibits hereto and thereto), together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to their subject matter.

Section 9.11. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 9.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. In the event of any
breach or threatened breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand, of any covenant or obligation of such party
contained in this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to, and the
other party will not oppose (on the basis that the other party has an
adequate remedy at law), in addition to any monetary remedy or damages and
without proof of damages or otherwise: a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation; and an injunction or other equitable relief restraining such
breach or threatened breach. The parties also agree that the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and
agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

(or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement and any other Section
or subsection of this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other Section or
subsection.

 

Section 9.14. _Rules of Construction_.

Exhibit A

 

RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

ACHILLION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

(originally incorporated on August 5, 1998)

 

FIRST: The name of the corporation (the "Corporation") is Achillion
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 

SECOND: The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the
State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801, County
of New Castle, and the name of its registered agent at such address is The
Corporation Trust Company.

 

THIRD: The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted
by the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware.

 

FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock that the Corporation
has the authority to issue shall be 2,000, consisting of 1,000 shares (each,
a "Preferred Share") of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share
("Preferred Stock") and 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share ("Common Stock").

 

A. COMMON STOCK

 

1. _General._ The dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock set forth herein. 

2. _Voting._ The holders of the Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written actions in lieu of meetings). 

 

B. PREFERRED STOCK

 

The rights, preferences, powers, privileges and restrictions, qualifications
and limitations granted and imposed on the Preferred Stock are as set forth
below in this Part B of this Article Fourth. Unless otherwise indicated,
references to "sections" or "subsections" in this Part B of this Article
Fourth refer to sections and subsections of Part B of this Article Fourth.

1. _Dividends._

 

(a) From and after the date of this Certificate of Incorporation, holders
of the Preferred Shares, in preference to the holders of any other class or
series of the Corporations stock (the "Junior Stock"), shall be entitled to
receive cumulative dividends (accruing from and after the date of issuance of
such Preferred Shares) at the rate of eight percent (8%) of the Preferred
Share Price (as hereinafter defined), which shall compound annually on each
outstanding Preferred Share whether or not such dividends are earned or
declared and whether or not sufficient funds are legally available therefor
(as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations
and related transactions with respect to such shares).

   

(b) So long as any Preferred Share shall be outstanding, no
dividend, whether in cash or property, shall be paid or declared, nor shall
any other distribution be made, on any Junior Stock, nor shall any shares of
any Junior Stock of the Corporation be purchased, redeemed, or otherwise
acquired for value by the Corporation or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof
(except for acquisitions of Common Stock by the Corporation pursuant to
agreements which permit the Corporation to repurchase such shares upon
termination of services to the Corporation at a price per share determined in
accordance with such agreements or upon the exercise of the Corporations
right of first offer, if any, upon a proposed transfer) until all accrued
dividends on the Preferred Shares shall have been paid.

 

2. _Liquidation._

 

(a) Upon a Liquidation (as defined below), after payment or provision for
payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of
the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, out of the remaining assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, with
respect to each Preferred Share, an amount (the "Preference Amount") equal to
the sum of (A) $50,000 (the " _Preferred Share_ Price") and (B) all accrued
and unpaid dividends (subject to equitable adjustment as a result of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, reverse split, reclassification or
similar event after the date of issuance of the first Preferred Share) before
any distribution shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock, or any
other class or series of Junior Stock of the Corporation. If upon
any Liquidation the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of Preferred Shares
the full Preference Amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders of
Preferred Shares shall share pro rata in any distribution of assets in
accordance with their respective Preference Amounts.

 

(b) "Liquidation" means (i) any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, other than any dissolution,
liquidation or winding up in connection with any reincorporation of the
Corporation in another jurisdiction, or (ii) any Sale of the Corporation.
"Sale of the Corporation" means (i) the sale of all or substantially all of
the Corporations assets, (ii) the sale or transfer of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Corporation, or (iii) the merger or consolidation of
the Corporation with another person or entity, in each case in clauses (ii)
and (iii) of this sentence above under circumstances in which the holders of
the voting power of outstanding capital stock of the Corporation, immediately
prior to such transaction, own less than 50% in voting power of the
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation or the surviving or resulting
corporation or acquirer, as the case may be, immediately following such
transaction. A sale (or multiple related sales) of one or more subsidiaries of
the Corporation (whether by way or merger, consolidation, reorganization or
sale of all or substantially all assets or securities) which constitutes all
or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Corporation shall be
deemed a Sale of the Corporation.

 



\- 2 -

    

(c) If any or all of the proceeds payable to the stockholders of
the Corporation in connection with a Liquidation are in a form other than
cash or marketable securities, the fair market value of such consideration
shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

 

(d) _Payments to Holders of Common Stock._ In the event of a Liquidation,
after the payment in full of all Preference Amounts required to be paid to
the holders of Preferred Shares, the remaining assets of the Corporation
available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the
holders of shares of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares
held by each such holder.

3. _Redemption._

 

(a) At any time after the three-year anniversary of the date of this
Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation may, at its option, and at any
time, redeem, at the applicable Preference Amount (as determined in Section
2(a) above), all (but not less than all) of the Preferred Stock then
outstanding. The Corporation shall give notice pursuant to this Section 3 to
all of the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Shares at the address of
each such holder appearing on the books of the Corporation or given by such
holder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice.

 

(b) _Notice._ If the Corporation elects to redeem the Preferred Shares in
accordance with Section 3(a), the Corporation shall mail a notice of
redemption (the "Redemption Notice") to each holder of Preferred Shares,
addressed to such stockholder at the address appearing on the books of the
Corporation. The Redemption Notice shall include (i) the shares to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the redemption price and (iv) the
place at which the stockholders may obtain payment of the redemption price
upon surrender of their share certificates.

 

(c) _Cessation of Rights._ If funds are available on the date fixed for a
redemption of the Preferred Shares, then, whether or not the certificates
representing the Preferred Shares which are to be redeemed are surrendered for
payment of the applicable redemption price, the Preferred Shares which are
redeemed shall no longer be outstanding and the holders thereof shall cease
to be stockholders of the Corporation with respect to the Preferred Shares
redeemed on or after the date fixed for redemption and shall be entitled only
to receive the applicable redemption price for such redeemed shares,
without interest, upon surrender of the certificates, representing the
redeemed shares.

4. _Voting._ No holder of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to any voting rights with respect to such Preferred Shares, except as required by law. 

 



\- 3 -

    

FIFTH: In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by
statute, it is further provided that:

(a) Subject to the limitations and exceptions, if any, contained in the
by-laws of the Corporation, such by-laws may be adopted, amended or repealed
by the board of directors of the Corporation; and

 

(b) Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless, and only
to the extent, otherwise provided in the by-laws of the Corporation; and

(c) Subject to any applicable requirements of law, the books of the
Corporation may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such location or
locations as may be designated by the board of directors of the Corporation or
in the by-laws of the Corporation; and

(d) Except as provided to the contrary in the provisions establishing a
class of stock, the number of authorized shares of such class may be increased
or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote, voting as a single class.

SIXTH: The Corporation shall indemnify each person who at any time is, or
shall have been, a director or officer of the Corporation and was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement incurred in connection with any such action, suit or
proceeding, to the maximum extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Corporation to
indemnify or advance expenses to any person in connection with any action,
suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim initiated by or on behalf of such
person (other than actions, suits, proceedings, claims or counterclaims to
enforce such persons rights to indemnification or advancement) unless such
action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim was authorized in the specific
case by the board of directors of the Corporation. The foregoing right of
indemnification shall in no way be exclusive of any other rights of
indemnification to which any such director or officer may be entitled, under
any by-law, agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise. No
amendment to or repeal of the provisions of this Article SIXTH shall deprive
a director or officer of the benefit hereof with respect to any act or failure
to act occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. In furtherance of and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance expenses,
including attorneys fees, incurred by an officer or director of the
Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director or officer to repay such advances if it shall be ultimately
determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation.

 



\- 4 -

    

SEVENTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages arising out of
such directors breach of fiduciary duty as a director of the Corporation,
except to the extent that the elimination or limitation of such liability
is not permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended. No amendment to or repeal of the
provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall deprive any director of the
Corporation of the benefit hereof with respect to any act or failure to act
of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.

 

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware and this Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred
upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which
restates, integrates and amends the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation, and which has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228,
242 and 245 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, has been executed by its
duly authorized officer this [ _ _] day of [ _ _].

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS AGREEMENT

 

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS AGREEMENT, dated as of [●], 20[ ] (this
"Agreement"), by and between Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), [●], as rights agent (the "Rights Agent"), in favor of
each person who from time to time holds one or more contingent value rights
(the "CVRs") to receive cash payments in the amounts and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, this Agreement is entered into pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated October 15, 2019 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among
Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Parent and Beagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly
owned by Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary
will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the
Company surviving (the "Surviving Corporation"), on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth therein;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, Parent has agreed to provide to the Holders of shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") and Holders
of In the Money Options (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the "Option
Holders") the right to receive the Regulatory Approval Milestone Payment and
the Clinical Trial Milestone Payment (each, as defined below) during the
Regulatory Approval Milestone Period and the Clinical Trial Milestone Period,
respectively (each as defined below);

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, the potential amount payable per CVR with
respect to the Regulatory Approval Milestone Payment is $1.00 in cash,
without interest; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, the potential amount payable per CVR with
respect to the Clinical Trial Milestone Payment is $1.00 in cash, without
interest.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the consummation of
the transactions referred to above, Parent and the Rights Agent agree, for
the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders (as hereinafter defined),
as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

DEFINITIONS 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and
not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

 

"Adaptive Trial" means a Clinical Trial that is designed to allow for a
prospectively planned modification from a Phase II Clinical Trial to a Phase
III Clinical Trial based on accumulating data from subjects in such Clinical
Trial (as permitted by the FDA).

 

"Assignment Transaction" means any transaction (including a sale of assets,
spin-off, split-off or licensing transaction), other than a Change in
Control, pursuant to which (a) any rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including Intellectual Property rights) (i) necessary for 

   

 the development or commercialization of any Product or (ii) useful for the
development or commercialization of any Product (other than, in the case of
any useful but not necessary rights, to the extent that the applicable
transaction would not reasonably be expected to result in a material delay in
achievement of any of the Milestones) or (b) all or substantially all of the
assets used or held for use in connection with any Product, in each case (in
respect of the foregoing (a) and (b)) are, directly or indirectly, disposed
of, sold, licensed, assigned, conveyed, or transferred to or acquired by any
Person other than by Parent or any of Parents direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiaries (such Person, the "Acquiror"). An "Assignment Transaction"
shall not apply to (a) sales of a Product made by Parent or its Affiliates to
distributors in the ordinary course, or ordinary course licensing
arrangements between Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and third
party distributors, contract research organizations or contract manufacturers
on the other hand, entered into in the ordinary course of business for
purposes of developing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a Product, in
each case, on Parents or its Affiliates behalf and (b) licenses granted by
Parent or its Affiliates so long as Parent and its Affiliates retain any and
all necessary rights and useful rights (other than, in the case of any useful
but not necessary rights, to the extent that the applicable license would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material delay in achievement of any of
the Milestones) to develop and obtain approval by the FDA and any other
applicable Regulatory Authority to market and sell the Products. For purposes
of this definition, any delay that reasonably would be expected to result in
failure to achieve any of the Milestones hereunder shall be deemed to be a
"material delay."

"Board of Directors" means the board of directors of Parent or any other body
performing similar functions, or any duly authorized committee of that board.

"Board Resolution" means a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors
that has been certified in writing by the chairman of the Board of Directors,
the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, executive vice
president, company secretary or a deputy company secretary of Parent to have
been duly adopted by the Board of Directors and to be in full force and effect
on the date of such certification, which has been delivered to the Rights
Agent.

 

"Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which
commercial banks are authorized or required by Law or executive order to be
closed in New York City.

"Change in Control" means (a) a merger or consolidation involving Parent in
which Parent is not the surviving entity, (b) any transaction involving Parent
in which Parent is the surviving entity but in which the stockholders of
Parent immediately prior to such transaction own less than fifty percent
(50%) of Parents voting power immediately after the transaction or (c) any
sale of all or substantially all of Parents assets.

 

"Clinical Trial" means a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product conducted
on human subjects.

 

"Clinical Trial Milestone" means, and will be deemed to occur upon, the
earlier of (a) first dosing of the first patient with the Clinical Trial
Product in the first Phase III Clinical Trial, (b) the Conversion Date for the
first Converted Trial of the Clinical Trial Product (and, for clarity, the
first dosing of the first patient in an Adaptive Trial prior to the

"Commercially Reasonable Efforts" means, with respect to each Product, using
such efforts and resources typically used by Parent for the development and

authority-approved labeling and pricing, the competitiveness of alternative
products in the marketplace or under development, the current or future status
as an orphan product, the patent coverage and proprietary position of such
Product, the likelihood of development success or regulatory approval, the
regulatory structure involved, the anticipated profitability of such Product,
and other relevant scientific, technical and commercial factors typically

Parent or any of its Affiliates guarantee either of the Milestones will be
achieved or that either of the Milestones will be achieved by a specific

such Milestone. For clarity, the application of Commercially Reasonable
Efforts will not necessarily require Parent to disadvantage any particular
currently available competing products or products currently under development
by Parent or any of its Affiliates or which may in the future enter
development by Parent or any of its Affiliates, the success of which may
reduce the prospects of achieving the relevant Milestone. Any payments payable

account in determining Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

 

Section 2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive
contingent cash payments pursuant to this Agreement. The initial Holders
shall be the (i) holders of Shares other than Dissenting Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) holders of Company Stock Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time whose Company Stock Options are
converted into the right to receive the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.06_ of the Merger Agreement.

transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer. Any

CVRs in whole or in part, that is not a Permitted Transfer, will be void ab
initio and of no effect.

 



6

    

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer;
Change of Address_.

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the "CVR Register") for the
purpose of registering CVRs and Permitted Transfers. The CVR Register will
initially show one position for Cede and Co. representing all Shares held by DTC
on behalf of street name holders held by such holders as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. In the case of Option Holders, the CVRs shall be
registered in the names and addresses of such Option Holder and in a
denomination equal to the number of Shares subject to the outstanding number
of Shares underlying the outstanding In the Money Options held by such Option
Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, in each case, as set
forth in a schedule delivered by the Company to Parent (the "Equity Awards
Schedule"). Except as otherwise provided herein, once registered on the CVR
Register, such Option Holders shall be deemed "Holders" pursuant to this
Agreement and entitled to all rights, and privileges and subject to all
obligations under this Agreement. The Rights Agent hereby acknowledges the
restrictions on transfer contained in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and agrees not to
register a transfer which does not comply with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.2_, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and other requested
documentation in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to
its customary policies and guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof,
the Holders attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holders personal
representative or the Holders survivor, and setting forth in reasonable
detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt of such
written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer
otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.2_), register the transfer of
the CVRs in the CVR Register. Each of Parent and the Rights Agent may require
payment, from any such Holder and any such transferee, of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp or other Tax or other charge of any nature whatsoever that is
imposed by a Governmental Authority or Taxing Authority in connection with any
such registration of transfer. Each of Parent and the Rights Agent shall have
no duty or obligation to take any action under any section of this Agreement
that requires the payment by a Holder or a transferee of a CVR of applicable
Taxes or charges unless and until each of Parent and the Rights Agent is
satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have been paid by such Holder or
such transferee. All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register
shall be the valid obligations of Parent and shall entitle the transferee to
the same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held
immediately prior to the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR
shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. The written request must be
duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall, subject to its reasonable determination that the written notice
is in proper form, promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

Section 2.4 _Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) If the Clinical Trial Milestone occurs at any time prior to the
expiration of the Clinical Trial Milestone Period, then, on or prior to the
applicable Milestone Payment Date, Parent will deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Rights Agent (i) a certificate (a "Milestone Achievement
Certificate") certifying the date of the satisfaction of the Clinical Trial
Milestone and that the Holders are entitled to receive the Clinical Trial
Milestone Payment and (ii) a wire transfer of Dollars in immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Rights Agent, in the aggregate amount
equal to the number of CVRs (as reflected in the CVR Register) then
outstanding multiplied by the amount of the Clinical Trial Milestone Payment
(the "Aggregate Clinical Trial Milestone Payment"), provided that Parent
may instead, at its discretion, pay directly to the Surviving Corporation the
aggregate amount payable to all Option Holders. After receipt of the wire
transfer described in the foregoing sentence, the Rights Agent will promptly
(and in any event, within five (5) Business Days) pay (x) by one lump sum
wire payment to DTC for any Holder who is a former street name holder of
Shares, (y) by one lump sum wire payment to the Surviving Corporation for all
Option Holders (unless Parent has paid such amount itself to the Surviving
Corporation) and (z) for all other Holders, by check mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to the address of each Holder set forth in the CVR Register
or by other method of delivery as specified by the applicable Holder in
writing to the Rights Agent (such amount in (x), (y) and (z) together, an
amount in cash equal to Aggregate Clinical Trial Milestone Payment). The
Rights Agent shall hold the Aggregate Clinical Trial Milestone Payment in a
non-interest bearing account until such payment is made in accordance with the
foregoing sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Clinical Trial Milestone Payment more than once, and
Parent shall not be required to pay the Clinical Trial Milestone Payment if
the Clinical Trial Milestone occurs after the expiration of the Clinical Trial
Milestone Period.

 

(b) If the Regulatory Approval Milestone occurs at any time prior to the
expiration of the Regulatory Approval Milestone Period, then, on or prior to
the applicable Milestone Payment Date, Parent will deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Rights Agent (i) a Milestone Achievement Certificate
certifying the date of the satisfaction of the Regulatory Approval Milestone
and that the Holders are entitled to receive the Regulatory Approval Milestone
Payment and (ii) a wire transfer of Dollars of immediately available funds to
an account designated by the Rights Agent, in the aggregate amount equal to
the number of CVRs (as reflected in the CVR Register) then outstanding
multiplied by the amount of the Regulatory Approval Milestone Payment (the
"Aggregate Regulatory Approval Milestone Payment", together with
the Aggregate Clinical Trial Milestone Payment, the "Aggregate Milestone
Payments"), provided that Parent may instead, at its discretion, pay directly
to the Surviving Corporation the aggregate amount payable to all Option
Holders. After receipt of the wire transfer described in the foregoing
sentence, the Rights Agent will promptly (and in any event, within five (5)
Business Days) pay (x) by one lump sum wire payment to DTC for any Holder who
is a former street name holder of Shares, (y) by one lump sum wire payment to
the Surviving Corporation for all Option Holders (unless Parent has paid such
amount itself to the Surviving Corporation) and (z) for all other Holders, by
check mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the address of each Holder set
forth in the CVR Register or by other method of delivery as specified by the
applicable Holder in writing to the Rights Agent (such amount in (x), (y) and
(z) together, an amount in cash equal to Aggregate Regulatory Approval
Milestone Payment). The Rights Agent shall hold the Aggregate Regulatory
Approval Milestone Payment in a non-interest bearing account until such
payment is made in accordance with the foregoing sentence. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Regulatory
Approval Milestone Payment more than once and Parent shall not be required to
pay the Regulatory Approval Milestone Payment if the Regulatory Approval
Milestone occurs after the expiration of the Regulatory Approval Milestone
Period.

(c) Except in respect of the CVRs corresponding to In the Money Options
(which such CVRs shall be subject to the Tax withholding provisions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 2.08_ of the Merger Agreement), each of Parent and the
Rights Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from either of
the Milestone Payments, if payable, such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the applicable Milestone Payment or CVR
under the Code, and the rules and regulations thereunder, or any other
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes, as may
be reasonably determined by Parent or the Rights Agent. Prior to making any
such deduction or withholding, other than ordinary course payroll withholding
and reporting, if applicable, Parent or the Rights Agent, as applicable,
shall solicit IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8, or any other appropriate forms or
information from each Holder in order to avoid or reduce such deduction and
withholding, and the Milestone Payment may be reasonably delayed in order to
gather such forms or information. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall
be timely remitted over to the relevant Governmental Authorities. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted and withheld and timely remitted to the
relevant Governmental Authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. As required by applicable Law, Parent
or the Rights Agent, as applicable, shall deliver to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid an original IRS Form 1099 or other
reasonably acceptable evidence of such withholding.

(d) Any portion of any Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the
Holders twelve (12) months after the date of the applicable Milestone
Achievement Certificate shall be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon
demand, and any Holder shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
such Milestone Payment, without interest, but such Holder shall have no
greater rights against Parent than those accorded to general unsecured
creditors of Parent under applicable Law.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Milestone Payment delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. In addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity
obligation herein, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Rights
Agent with respect to any liability, penalty, cost or expense the Rights Agent
may incur or be subject to in connection with transferring such property to
Parent.

 

(f) Except to the extent any portion of the Milestone Payment is required
to be treated as imputed interest and except as otherwise required pursuant
to applicable Law, the Parties hereto intend to treat the Milestone Payments
payable with respect to Shares for all Tax purposes as consideration for the
Shares, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, report imputed interest on the CVRs as required by
applicable Law.

11

    

(b) If the Rights Agent provides notice of its intent to resign,

shall promptly, appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent. If Parent shall
fail to make such appointment within thirty (30) days after giving notice of
such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or

counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This

hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right

Section 6.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
State that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
The Parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle
County, Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only if)
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County, Delaware and any appellate court therefrom. Each
Party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court in respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action, suit or
proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of
such court, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in
or by such courts. Each Party hereto agrees that notice or the service of
process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or
delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or
in any other manner permitted by law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 6.6 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

Section 6.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the Parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 



17

    

Section 6.8 _Third-Party Beneficiaries; Action by Majority Holders_.
Parent and the Rights Agent hereby agree that the respective covenants and
agreements set forth herein are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Majority Holders, who are intended third-party
beneficiaries hereof. Parent and the Rights Agent further agree that this
Agreement and their respective covenants and agreements set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of Parent, the Rights Agent, the Holders and their
respective permitted successors and assigns hereunder in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, will confer upon any Person other than Parent, the Rights Agent,
the Holders and their permitted successors and assigns hereunder any benefit
or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim hereunder. Except for the
right of the Rights Agent set forth herein, the Majority Holders will have the
sole right, on behalf of all Holders, by virtue of or under any provision of
this Agreement, to institute any action or proceeding at Law or in equity or
in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Agreement,
and no individual Holder or other group of Holders will be entitled to
exercise such rights. The Parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies will not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages. Accordingly, the Parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach by Parent or Assignee (as such term is
defined below), on the one hand, or the Rights Agent or the Majority Holders,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement, Parent or Assignee, on the one hand, and the Rights
Agent or the Majority Holders, on the other hand, shall be entitled to (and
the other Party will not oppose) an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement, by the other(s) (as applicable), and to
specific enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.9 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties
agree to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 6.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable
provided, however, that (a) Parent may assign this Agreement to a Person
(each such Person, an "Assignee") (i) which is a direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent; provided that Parent remains jointly and severally
liable, (ii) with the prior consent of the Majority Holders, whether
evidenced in writing or taken at a meeting of the Holders, or (iii) in
connection with a transaction involving an Assignment Transaction conducted in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ and (b) the Rights Agent may assign this
Agreement to a successor Rights Agent appointed in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.3_.

 

Section 6.11 _Benefits of Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any Holder may at any time agree to renounce, in
whole or in part, whether or not for consideration, such Holders rights under
this Agreement by written notice to the Rights Agent and Parent, which notice,
if given, shall be irrevocable. Parent may, in its sole discretion, at any
time, offer consideration to Holders in exchange for their agreement to
irrevocably renounce their rights hereunder.

 



18

    

Section 6.12 _Legal Holidays_. In the event that any Milestone Payment
Date shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary) payment need not be made on such date, but may be
made, without the accrual of any additional interest thereon on account
of such Milestone Payment Date not being a Business Day, on the next
succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
Milestone Payment Date.

 

Section 6.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 _GENERAL RELEASE_



        |  |   |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  Last |  | First |  | 
    Employees Last Name |  | First Name |  | Middle Initial 
 

I, the undersigned, am executing and delivering this Agreement in connection
with that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [_________], 2019
(the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Alexion Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and [Beagle Merger Sub, Inc.], a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Subsidiary"), pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the
Company (the "Merger") with the Company to survive the Merger and become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. As a condition to its willingness to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Parent has
required that I enter into this Agreement.

 

In consideration of the covenants and agreements set forth in the Merger
Agreement and in this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the acceleration of my unvested Company Stock Options for which I was
otherwise not entitled), and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I hereby confirm my
understanding and agreement, as follows:

1\. _Definition_. For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Company" means and
includes Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and all of its current, past and
future successors, subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns, including without
limitation Merger Subsidiary and Parent. Any capitalized term used herein but
not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the
Merger Agreement.

2\. _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, in consideration for the right to
receive the payment provided for in the Merger Agreement (including, without
limitation, the acceleration of my unvested Company Stock Options), I
acknowledge and agree, on behalf of myself and, if and only to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law, each of my agents, trustees,
beneficiaries, directors, officers, controlled Affiliates, subsidiaries,
estate, successors, assigns, members and partners (each, a "Releasing Party")
that I irrevocably and unconditionally release (i) Parent, (ii) the Company;
(iii) each person or entity that is an Affiliate of the Company or Parent;
and (iv) the successors and past, present and future assigns, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives of the respective
Persons identified or otherwise referred to in any of clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of this Section 2 (collectively, the "Releasees") from and
after the Effective Time from any and all past, present or future dispute,
claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action or cause of
action of any kind or nature, including: (A) any unknown, unsuspected or
undisclosed claim; and (B) any claim or right that may be asserted or
exercised by the Releasing Party or any Affiliate of the Releasing Party, but
in case of each of clauses (A) and (B), only to the extent relating to or
arising (directly or indirectly) out of any act, omission or event occurring
prior to the Closing, including without limitation any claims relating to
employment with the Company and any claims relating to the my ownership of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, or any securities

 



Page 1 of 5

    

 convertible or exchangeable for Company Common Stock or any actual or
promised grants of any of the foregoing (collectively, "Claims"); provided
that I am not releasing any of my rights (and the Releasees are not hereby
released from any of their obligations) under or relating to (I) the Merger
Agreement, or any other agreement entered into in connection with the Merger
Agreement, including, the right to receive payments under the Merger
Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the Merger
Agreement, (II) any vested rights under any employee benefits plans and any
accrued obligations as to salaries, wages, accrued vacation, commissions,
or reimbursable expenses, and (III) any obligations of the Releasees to
indemnify any officer or director of the Company in their capacity as such and
any rights with respect to any directors and officers liability insurance
policy maintained by the Company.

(b) I (on my own behalf and if and only to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law, on behalf of the my Affiliates) hereby waive the benefits of,
and any rights that I or any of the my Affiliates may have under, any statute
or common law regarding the release of unknown Claims in any jurisdiction. I
acknowledge that I have read Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of
California that provides as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 

I hereby waive any right or benefit relating to a Claim that I have or may
have under Section 1542 of the Civil Code, any similar law of any other
jurisdiction, or any common law principles of similar effect, to the full
extent that I may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to
the subject matter of this Agreement. I acknowledge that I or
my representatives may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or
different from those that I now know or believe to exist with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, but that it is my intention in executing
this Agreement to fully, finally and forever settle and release all of the
matters released herein in respect of a Claim. In furtherance of this
intention, the release herein granted shall be and remain in effect
notwithstanding the discovery of any such additional or different claim or
fact.

(c) The release pursuant to this Section 2 is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, and shall
become null and void, and shall have no effect whatsoever, without any action
on the part of any Person, upon termination of the Merger Agreement for any
reason.

 

3\. _Severability and Interpretation_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
provisions shall nonetheless be enforceable according to their terms. Further,
in the event that any provision is held to be overbroad as written, such
provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent
necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and
enforced as amended.

 



Page 2 of 5

    

4\. _Waiver_. The Companys waiver or failure to enforce the terms of
this Agreement or any similar agreement in one instance shall not constitute
a waiver of its rights hereunder with respect to other violations of this or
any other agreement. In addition, any amendment to or modification of this
Agreement or any waiver of any provision hereof must be in writing and signed
by the Company.

5\. _Notices_. Any notice which the Company is required or may desire to give
to me shall be given to me by personal delivery or registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, addressed to me at the address of record with
the Company, or at such other place as I may from time to time designate
in writing. Any notice which I am required or may desire to give to the
Company hereunder shall be given by personal delivery or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Companys General
Counsel at the Companys principal office, or at such other office as the
Company may from time to time designate in writing. The date of personal
delivery or the dates of mailing any such notice shall be deemed to be the
date of delivery thereof.

 

6\. _Acquiescence in Injunction_. I understand that if I violate any provision
of this Agreement the Company will be irreparably harmed and will have no
adequate remedy at law. The Company shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights it may have, to obtain in any court of competent jurisdiction
injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise
to specifically enforce, this Agreement.

7\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes arising under or in
connection with it shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws of such state. I
hereby submit for the sole purpose of this Agreement and any dispute arising
under or in connection with it to the jurisdiction of the courts located in
the State of Delaware, and hereby waive any objection (on the grounds of lack
of jurisdiction or forum non conveniens or otherwise) to the exercise of such
jurisdiction over me by any such courts.

 

8\. _Survival_. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date entered
below. My obligations under this Agreement shall survive the termination of
my employment regardless of the manner of such termination and shall be
binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

 

9\. _Assignment_. The Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement to
its successors and assigns, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said successors or assigns. I
will not assign this Agreement.

10\. _Other Agreements_. If I have signed or do sign other agreements with
the Company relating to any subject matter in this Agreement, the Companys
benefits and protections under each such agreement will be given full force
and effect and will be interpreted to provide the Company with cumulative
rights and remedies such that the terms most protective of the Companys
interests are enforced.

 

11\. _Compliance_. If requested by the Company, I agree to submit a written
declaration or affidavit affirming my compliance with this Agreement, under
penalty of perjury.

12\. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, including
by electronic delivery, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which shall be taken together and deemed to be one instrument.

13\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. ANY ACTION, DEMAND, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING
UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE ALONE AND
EACH OF THE COMPANY AND I WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL THEREOF.

I, the undersigned, recognize the importance of protecting the Companys
rights and legitimate interests in its ideas, inventions, discoveries, trade
secrets, confidential information and good will and, further, recognize that
execution of this Agreement is an express condition of my employment.

 

I also am executing and delivering this Agreement in connection with that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [_________], 2019 (the
"Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and [Beagle Merger Sub, Inc.], a Delaware

pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the

In consideration of the covenants and agreements set forth in the Merger
Agreement and in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
acceleration of my unvested Company Stock Options for which I was otherwise
not entitled), and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I hereby confirm my
understanding and agreement, as follows:

 

1\. _Definition_. For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Company" means and
includes Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and all of its current, past and
future successors, subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns, including without
limitation Merger Subsidiary and Parent. Any capitalized term used herein but
not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in
the Merger Agreement.

2\. _Covenant Not to Disclose_.

 

(a) I agree that I will not, at any time during or after the termination of my
employment with the Company, regardless of the reason for my termination, and
except as otherwise permitted by Section 5 below, communicate, disclose or
otherwise make available to any person or entity (other than the Company), or
use for my account (except in the course of my employment with the Company)
or for the benefit of any other person or entity, directly or indirectly,
unless authorized by the Company in writing, any information or materials
proprietary to the Company that relates to the Companys
business, organization, finances or affairs which is of a confidential
nature, including, but not limited to, trade secrets, technical, scientific or
other secrets, information or materials relating to existing or proposed
pharmaceutical products (in all and various stages of development), business
plans, suppliers, licensors, licensees, investors, affiliates, inventions,
designs, methods, techniques, systems, processes, data, software programs,
software code, "know-how", marketing information and materials, marketing and

 



Page 1 of 12

    

 development plans, customer lists and other customer information (including
current prospects), price lists, pricing policies, personnel information
obtained because of my duties and responsibilities, training methods and
materials and financial information (collectively, "Proprietary Information").
Proprietary Information includes any and all such information and materials,
whether or not obtained by me with the knowledge and permission of the
Company, whether or not developed, devised or otherwise created in whole or in
part by my efforts, and whether or not a matter of public knowledge unless as
a result of authorized disclosure. I further agree that I will retain such
knowledge and information which I acquire and develop during my employment
respecting such Proprietary Information in trust for the sole and exclusive
benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns, and except as
otherwise permitted by Section 5 below, shall not use or attempt to use any
Proprietary Information except as may be required in the ordinary course of
performing my duties as a Company employee or use any proprietary information
in any manner that may injure or cause loss or may be calculated to injure or
cause loss to the Company, whether directly or indirectly.

(b) The provisions of this Paragraph shall apply to Proprietary Information
obtained by the Company from any third party.

3\. _Inventions_. 

(a) If at any time or times during my employment, I shall (either alone or
with others) make, conceive, create, discover, invent or reduce to practice
any Development that (i) relates to the business of the Company or any
customer of or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services
being developed, manufactured or sold by the Company or which may be used in
relation therewith; or (ii) results from tasks assigned to me by the Company;
or (iii) results from the use of premises or personal property (whether
tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company, then
all such Developments and the benefits thereof are and shall immediately
become the sole and absolute property of the Company and its assigns, as
"works made for hire" pursuant to the United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.
Section 101) or otherwise. The term "Development" shall mean any invention,
idea, creation, modification, discovery, design, development, improvement,
biological or other process, cell line, lab notebook, software program, work
of authorship, documentation, formula, data, technique, know-how, trade
secret or intellectual property right whatsoever or any interest therein
(whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright, trademark or
similar statutes or subject to analogous protection). I shall promptly
disclose to the Company (or any persons designated by it) each such
Development. I hereby assign all rights (including, but not limited to, rights
to inventions, patentable subject matter, copyrights and trademarks), title
and interest that I may have or may acquire in the Developments and all
benefits and/or rights resulting therefrom to the Company and its assigns
without further compensation and shall communicate, without cost or delay,
and without disclosing to others the same, all available information relating
thereto (with all necessary plans and models) to the Company.

 

(b) I agree that I will promptly disclose to the Company all ideas,
inventions, discoveries and improvements (including, but not limited to,
those which are or may be patentable or subject to copyright protection) which
I make, originate, conceive or reduce to practice during my employment with
the Company and which relate directly or indirectly 

 



Page 2 of 12

    

 to the business of the Company or to work or investigations done for the
Company (collectively, "Inventions"). All Inventions shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Company, and I hereby assign to the Company all
rights therein, except as may otherwise be specifically agreed by the Company
in writing. I further represent that, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
none of the Developments will violate or infringe upon any right, patent,
copyright, trademark or right of privacy, or constitute libel or slander
against or violate any other rights of any person, firm or corporation, and
that I will use my best efforts to prevent any such violation.

 

(c) In order that the Company may protect its rights in the Inventions, I will
make adequate written records of all Inventions, which records shall be the
Companys property; and, both during and after termination of my employment
with the Company, I will, without charge to the Company but at its request and
expense, sign all papers, including forms of assignment, and render any other
proper assistance necessary or desirable to transfer or record the transfer to
the Company of my entire right, title and interest in and to the Inventions,
and for the Company to obtain, maintain and enforce patents,
copyrights, trade secrets or other protections thereon or with respect
thereto (as the case may be) throughout the world.

(d) I represent that the Developments identified in the Appendix, if any,
attached hereto comprise all the Developments that I have made or conceived
prior to my employment by the Company, which Developments are excluded from
this Agreement. I understand that it is only necessary to list the title of
such Developments and the purpose thereof but not details of the Development
itself. IF THERE ANY SUCH DEVELOPMENTS TO BE EXCLUDED, THE UNDERSIGNED SHOULD
INITIAL HERE, OTHERWISE IT WILL BE DEEMED THAT THERE ARE NO SUCH EXCLUSIONS.
____________

(e) The obligations contained in this Paragraph 3 shall continue beyond
the termination of my employment with respect to Inventions (whether
patentable or copyrightable or not) conceived or made by me during the period
of my employment.

 

(f) With respect to any Developments, and work of any similar nature (from any
source), whenever created, which I have not prepared or originated in the
performance of my employment, but which I provide to the Company or
incorporate in any Company product or system, I hereby grant to the Company a
royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license
throughout the world to use, modify, create derivative works from, disclose,
publish, translate, reproduce, deliver, perform, dispose of, and to authorize
others so to do, all such Developments. I will not include in any
Developments I deliver to the Company or use on its behalf, without the prior
written approval of the Company, any material which is or will be patented,
copyrighted or trademarked by me or others unless I provide the Company with
the written permission of the holder of any patent, copyright or trademark
owner for the Company to use such material in a manner consistent with then-
current Company policy.

 



Page 3 of 12

    

(g) By this Agreement, I irrevocably constitute and appoint the Company as my
agent and attorney-in-fact for the purpose of executing, in my name and on my
behalf, such instruments or other documents as may be necessary to transfer,
confirm and perfect in the Company the rights I have granted to the Company
in this Paragraph 3 and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
prosecution and issuance of patent, copyright or trademark registrations or
any other legal protection thereon with the same legal force and effect as if
executed by me.

4\. _Covenant to Report; Documents and Tangible Property_. I will promptly
communicate and disclose to the Company all observations made and data
obtained by me in the course of my employment by the Company and shall not
make, use or permit to be used (at any time) any Company Property otherwise
than for the benefit of the Company. "Company Property" shall include all
written materials, records, documents and other tangible property made by me
or coming into my possession during my employment concerning the business or
affairs of the Company, including, but not limited to, any Proprietary
Information and/or any Inventions which are conceived or generated by me. All
Company Property shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company and,
upon the termination of my employment (or at such earlier time as the Company
may request me to do so), I will promptly deliver the same, in my possession,
custody or control, to the Company or to any party designated by it, without
retaining any copies, notes or excerpts thereof. I agree to render to the
Company, or to any party designated by it, such reports of the activities
undertaken by me or conducted under my direction during my employment as the
Company may request.

 

5\. _Scope of Disclosure Restrictions_. I understand and acknowledge that
nothing in this Agreement prohibits me from communicating with government
agencies about possible violations of federal, state, or local laws or
otherwise providing information to government agencies or participating in
government agency investigations or proceedings, and that I am not required to
notify the Company of any such communications; provided, however, that
nothing herein authorizes the disclosure of information I obtained through a
communication that was subject to the attorney-client privilege. Further,
notwithstanding my confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations, I
understand that, and the Company is hereby advising me as follows, pursuant to
the Defend Trade Secrets Act: "An individual shall not be held criminally or
civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure
of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or
local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney;
and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a
lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual
who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a
suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of
the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,
if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under
seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court
order."

6\. _Post-Employment Covenants to the Company_. In order to protect the
Companys interests in its Proprietary Information, Inventions, Developments,
Company Property, and its relationship with its employees, independent
contractors and its customers and suppliers, I hereby agree to the following
covenants, which I recognize are narrowly tailored to protect these
legitimate Company interests.

(a) _Covenant Not to Compete._ I shall not during my employment with the
Company and for a period of one year following the termination of my
employment for any reason engage in, or assist others in engaging in, or
participate in the formation of, any business or enterprise (whether as owner,
partner, officer, director, employee, consultant, investor, lender or
otherwise, except as the holder of not more than 1% of the outstanding stock
of a publicly-held company) that is, or is about to become, competitive with
Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s business as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including but not limited to any business or enterprise that
researches, develops, manufactures, distributes, markets, licenses, sells,
commercializes or provides any product that competes with any product
developed, manufactured, marketed, licensed, sold or provided, or planned to
be developed, manufactured, marketed, licensed, sold or provided, by Achillion
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. while I was employed by the Company.

 

(b) _Covenant Not to Solicit or Interfere_

 

(i) I shall not during my employment with the Company and for a period of one
year following the termination of my employment for any reason, either alone
or in association with others (x) solicit, induce or attempt to induce, any
employee or independent contractor of the Company to terminate his or her
employment or other engagement with the Company, or (y) recruit or attempt to
recruit, or engage or attempt to engage, any person who was employed or
otherwise engaged by the Company at any time during the term of my employment
with the Company; provided, that this clause (y) shall not apply to the
recruitment or hiring or other engagement of any individual whose employment
or other engagement with the Company has been terminated for a period of six
months or longer.

 

(ii) I shall not during my employment with the Company and for a period of one
year following the termination of my employment for any reason solicit,
divert or appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate, the
business of any customer or potential customer of the Company as an individual
on my own account, as a stockholder, principal, partner or joint venturer, as
the owner of an interest in, or as a director or officer of, any entity, as an
employee, agent, salesman, contractor or consultant of any person or entity,
or otherwise.

 

(iii) I shall not during my employment with the Company and for a period of
one year following the termination of my employment for any reason interfere
or attempt to interfere with the relationship of the Company with any person
or entity which at any time during my employment with the Company was an
employee, licensee, sales agent or sales representative (or
employee thereof), or customer, potential customer or vendor of, or supplier
or licensor to, or in the habit of dealing with, the Company, as an individual
on my own account, as a partner or joint venturer, as the owner of an interest
in, or as a director or officer of, any entity, as an employee, agent,
salesman, contractor or consultant of any person or entity, or otherwise.

 

(iv) I shall not during my employment with the Company and for a period of one
year following the termination of my employment for any reason employ or in
any manner solicit, induce or attempt to solicit or induce any licensee, sales
agent or sales representative (or any employee thereof) of, or any vendor,
supplier or licensor to, the Company, or any such person and/or entity whose

 



Page 5 of 12

    

 association with the Company has terminated within six (6) months prior to
or after my termination with the Company, to terminate his or its association
with the Company, or otherwise interfere with the relationship of the Company
with any such person or entity, whether for my own account or the account or
the account of any other person or entity.

 

7\. _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, in consideration for the right to
receive the payment provided for in the Merger Agreement (including, without
limitation, the acceleration of my unvested Company Stock Options), I
acknowledge and agree, on behalf of myself and, if and only to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law, each of my agents, trustees,
beneficiaries, directors, officers, controlled Affiliates, subsidiaries,
estate, successors, assigns, members and partners (each, a "Releasing Party")
that I irrevocably and unconditionally release (i) Parent, (ii) the Company;
(iii) each person or entity that is an Affiliate of the Company or Parent;
and (iv) the successors and past, present and future assigns, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and representatives of the respective
Persons identified or otherwise referred to in any of clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of this Section 7 (collectively, the "Releasees") from and
after the Effective Time from any and all past, present or future dispute,
claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action or cause of
action of any kind or nature, including: (A) any unknown, unsuspected or
undisclosed claim; and (B) any claim or right that may be asserted or
exercised by the Releasing Party or any Affiliate of the Releasing Party, but
in case of each of clauses (A) and (B), only to the extent relating to or
arising (directly or indirectly) out of any act, omission or event occurring
prior to the Closing, including without limitation any claims relating to
employment with the Company and any claims relating to the my ownership of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, or any securities convertible
or exchangeable for Company Common Stock or any actual or promised grants
of any of the foregoing (collectively, "Claims"); provided that I am not
releasing any of my rights (and the Releasees are not hereby released from any
of their obligations) under or relating to (I) the Merger Agreement, or any
other agreement entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement,
including, the right to receive payments under the Merger Agreement or any
other agreement entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement, (II) any
vested rights under any employee benefits plans and any accrued obligations
as to salaries, wages, accrued vacation, commissions, or reimbursable
expenses, and (III) any obligations of the Releasees to indemnify any officer
or director of the Company in their capacity as such and any rights with
respect to any directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained
by the Company.

 

(b) I (on my own behalf and if and only to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law, on behalf of the my Affiliates) hereby waive the benefits of,
and any rights that I or any of the my Affiliates may have under, any statute
or common law regarding the release of unknown Claims in any jurisdiction. I
acknowledge that I have read Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of
California that provides as follows:

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT
KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 



Page 6 of 12

    

I hereby waive any right or benefit relating to a Claim that I have or
may have under Section 1542 of the Civil Code, any similar law of any other
jurisdiction, or any common law principles of similar effect, to the full
extent that I may lawfully waive all such rights and benefits pertaining to
the subject matter of this Agreement. I acknowledge that I or my
representatives may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or
different from those that I now know or believe to exist with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, but that it is my intention in executing
this Agreement to fully, finally and forever settle and release all of the
matters released herein in respect of a Claim. In furtherance of this
intention, the release herein granted shall be and remain in
effect notwithstanding the discovery of any such additional or different
claim or fact.

(c) The release pursuant to this Section 7 is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, and shall
become null and void, and shall have no effect whatsoever, without any action
on the part of any Person, upon termination of the Merger Agreement for any
reason.

8\. _Severability and Interpretation_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
provisions shall nonetheless be enforceable according to their terms. Further,
in the event that any provision is held to be overbroad as written, such
provision shall be deemed amended to narrow its application to the extent
necessary to make the provision enforceable according to applicable law and
enforced as amended.

9.  _Waiver_. The Companys waiver or failure to enforce the terms of this
Agreement or any similar agreement in one instance shall not constitute a
waiver of its rights hereunder with respect to other violations of this or any
other agreement. In addition, any amendment to or modification of this
Agreement or any waiver of any provision hereof must be in writing and signed
by the Company.

 

10\. _Notices_. Any notice which the Company is required or may desire to give
to me shall be given to me by personal delivery or registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, addressed to me at the address of record with
the Company, or at such other place as I may from time to time designate in
writing. Any notice which I am required or may desire to give to the Company
hereunder shall be given by personal delivery or by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the Companys General Counsel at
the Companys principal office, or at such other office as the Company
may from time to time designate in writing. The date of personal delivery or
the dates of mailing any such notice shall be deemed to be the date of
delivery thereof.

 

11\. _Acquiescence in Injunction_. I understand that if I violate any
provision of this Agreement the Company will be irreparably harmed and will
have no adequate remedy at law. The Company shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights it may have, to obtain in any court of competent
jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of,
or otherwise to specifically enforce, this Agreement.

 



Page 7 of 12

    

12\. _No Conflicting Agreements; Disclosure to Future Employers_. I represent
and warrant to the Company that I am not subject to any restrictions on my
ability to grant to the Company the rights referred to in this Agreement, and
that I have not previously assumed any obligations inconsistent with those of
this Agreement. I further represent, warrant and covenant to the Company that
I am in compliance and shall remain in compliance with any and all obligations
previously assumed by me to any third party with respect to nondisclosure and
assignment of inventions. I have not entered into, and I will not enter into,
any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith. I will provide, and
the Company, in its discretion, may similarly provide, a copy of the covenants
contained in this Agreement to any business or enterprise which I may
directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, finance, join, control or in
which I may participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing, or
control, or with which I may be connected as an officer, director, employee,
partner, principal, agent, representative, consultant or otherwise. During the
one-year period following the termination of my employment for any reason, I
agree that if there is a reasonable possibility that my compliance with the
terms of this Agreement may be at risk by providing services to another person
or entity, then I will promptly, and in advance of providing any such
services: (i) notify that person or entity of my obligations under this
Agreement, and provide them a copy of this Agreement; and (ii) notify the
Companys General Counsel in writing of the identity of the person or entity
and a description of the services to be provided by me. The Company has the
right, at any time, to notify any third party of this Agreement and any
alleged violations.

13\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes arising under or in
connection with it shall be governed by the laws of the [Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania / State of Connecticut], without giving effect to the principles
of conflict of laws of such state. I hereby submit for the sole purpose of
this Agreement and any dispute arising under or in connection with it to the
jurisdiction of the courts located in the [Commonwealth of Pennsylvania /
State of Connecticut], and hereby waive any objection (on the grounds of lack
of jurisdiction or forum non conveniens or otherwise) to the exercise of such
jurisdiction over me by any such courts.

14.  _Survival_. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date entered
below. My obligations under this Agreement shall survive the termination of my
employment regardless of the manner of such termination and shall be binding
upon my heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

15\. _Assignment_. The Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement
to its successors and assigns, and all covenants and agreements hereunder
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by said successors or
assigns. I will not assign this Agreement.

 

16\. ___Cooperation_. During my employment with the Company and after my
employment ends, I agree to provide such information as the Company may
reasonably request with respect to any transaction or other matter in which I
was involved in any way during my employment. I further agree to assist and
cooperate with the Company in connection with the defense, prosecution,
government investigation, or internal investigation of any claim or matter
that may be made against, concerning, or by the Company. Such assistance and
cooperation shall include timely, comprehensive, and truthful disclosure of
all relevant facts known to me, including through in-person interview(s) with
the Companys internal Legal Department or outside counsel. The Company will
provide reimbursement for all properly documented reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with rendering services under this Section 16,
including, but not limited to, reimbursement for all reasonable travel,
lodging, and meal expenses.

 



Page 8 of 12

    

17\. _Nondisparagement_. I agree that I will not do or say anything that
disparages the Company, or any of their officers, directors or employees, or
reflects negatively on them, or encourages any adverse action against them,
except to the extent required by Applicable Law or as permitted by Section 5
above.

 

18\. ___At-Will Employment_. My employment with the Company is terminable at
will by the Company and/or me for any reason, with or without cause or notice,
and without following any specific procedures. Nothing in this Agreement
alters this at-will relationship, which may only be changed by a written
employment contract signed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer.

19\. ___Employment Changes_. This Agreement will remain in full force and
effect regardless of any changes to my position, title or primary work
location.

 

20\. ___Other Agreements_. If I have signed or do sign other agreements with
the Company relating to any subject matter in this Agreement, the Companys
benefits and protections under each such agreement will be given full force
and effect and will be interpreted to provide the Company with cumulative
rights and remedies such that the terms most protective of the Companys
interests are enforced.

21\. ___Compliance_. If requested by the Company, I agree to submit a written
declaration or affidavit affirming my compliance with this Agreement, under
penalty of perjury.

22.  __ _Exclusions for Attorneys_. If I am an attorney licensed to practice
law, I understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as a restriction on my ability to practice law, or to otherwise impose any
obligation on me that would violate the applicable rules governing the legal
profession in any jurisdiction in which I am so licensed, including: (a) as an
in-house attorney employed by an entity that competes with the Company; or
(b) as an employee, partner, or shareholder of a law firm that represents
clients that compete with the Company. If I am an attorney licensed to
practice law, I understand and acknowledge that, as a licensed attorney, I
have obligations in addition to those set forth in this Agreement to, among
other things, maintain strict confidentiality with respect to information
encompassed by the attorney/client privilege or the work product doctrine; and
such obligations continue indefinitely after my employment with the Company
ends. Accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in
accordance with my obligations as a licensed attorney and applicable rules of
professional conduct relating to the practice of law, and nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to expand or contract my ethical and professional
duties under those rules.

23.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
including by electronic delivery, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which shall be taken together and deemed to be one
instrument.

24\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. ANY ACTION, DEMAND, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING
UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE ALONE AND
EACH OF THE COMPANY AND I WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL THEREOF.
