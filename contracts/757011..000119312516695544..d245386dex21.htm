hereunder at the Closing will be calculated as follows: (i) $670,000,000 in

_minus_ (iii) the Estimated Closing Working Capital Deficiency, if any (the "
_Closing Purchase Price_ ").

contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") (all such transactions,
together with the

 



4  transactions contemplated by the other Transaction Agreements, being
referred to herein as the " _Contemplated Transactions_ ") at the offices of
Jones Day, 77 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 AM (Central Time)
(or at such other place as the Parties may designate in writing), on October
31, 2016; _provided_ that if the conditions precedent to the Closing (other
than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) are not satisfied or waived by October 26, 2016, then on the last
day of the next fiscal month of the Seller in which the Marketing Period has
ended and the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent to the
Closing listed in _Article 6_ occurs (at least three Business Days prior to
the end of such month) other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing (the " _Closing Date_ "). The effective time of
the Closing for tax, operational and all other matters will be deemed to be
11:59 PM (Central Time) on the Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

2.3. _Closing Deliveries_. At the Closing, the following actions will take
place, all of which will be deemed to have occurred simultaneously, and no
action will be deemed to have been completed or any document delivered until
all such actions have been completed and all required documents delivered,
unless waived by the relevant party for whose benefit such action should have
been completed or such document should have been delivered:

(a) The Seller will deliver, or will cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser
all instruments, duly executed, or other items which are required by the terms
hereof to be delivered at the Closing, including:

 

(i) stock certificates representing the Sellers ownership of the Shares, duly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock transfer powers;

(ii) the Transition Services Agreement;

 

(iii) the Headquarters Sublease Agreement;

 

(iv) the Supply Agreement;

 

(v) a certification from the Seller satisfying the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), dated as of the Closing Date, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, confirming that the Seller
is not a foreign Person;

 

(vi) a certificate signed by an officer of the Seller as required by _Section_
_ _ _6.3(e)_ ; and

 

(vii) all such other agreements and other instruments as the Purchaser may
reasonably request or as may be otherwise legally necessary to evidence and
effect the Contemplated Transactions.

(b) The Purchaser will deliver, or will cause to be delivered, to the Seller
all instruments, duly executed, or other items which are required by the terms
hereof to be delivered at the Closing, including:

 



5 (i) an amount equal to the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section_ _ _
_2.1(b)_ ;

(ii) the Transition Services Agreement;

 

(iii) the Headquarters Sublease Agreement;

 

(iv) the Supply Agreement;

 

(v) a certificate signed by an officer of the Purchaser as required by
_Section 6.2(e)_ ; and

 

(vi) all such other agreements and other instruments as the Seller may

effect the Contemplated Transactions.

2.4. _Closing Estimate Certificate_. Not less than three Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Seller will prepare (giving effect to its obligations
set forth in _Section 5.14_ ) and deliver to the Purchaser a certificate (the
" _Closing Estimate Certificate_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail the
Sellers good faith estimate of (a) the Closing Working Capital as of the
Effective Time (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ") and the amount of
any Estimated Closing Working Capital Surplus or Estimated Closing Working
Capital Deficiency and (b) the Sellers calculation of the Closing Purchase
Price. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital
exceeds the Target Closing Working Capital is referred to herein as the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital Surplus_." The amount, if any, by which the
Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Closing Working
Capital is referred to herein as the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital
Deficiency_." The Closing Estimate Certificate shall be based upon the records
of the Business and other information then available and the Seller shall
cooperate in good faith following delivery of the Closing Estimate
Certificate to answer questions with respect to the Closing Estimate
Certificate (provided that such questions shall in no way affect the timing of
the Closing).

 

2.5. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within 45 days after the Closing Date (unless the Closing Date occurs in
the third month of a fiscal quarter, in which case within 75 days after the
Closing Date), the Purchaser will prepare and deliver to the Seller a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, in reasonable detail,
the Purchasers calculation of (i) the Closing Working Capital as of
the Effective Time and (ii) the Purchasers calculation of the Closing
Purchase Price.

(b) During the 30-day period following delivery of the Closing Statement to
the Seller, the Purchaser will provide the Seller with reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to the books and
records and personnel of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies to
enable the Seller to evaluate the accuracy of the Closing Statement. If the
Seller disagrees with the determination of any component of the Closing
Statement calculations, then the Seller will notify the Purchaser in writing
(an " _Objection Notice_ ") of such disagreement within 30 days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, which Objection Notice will describe the
nature of any such disagreement in

 



6  reasonable detail, including the Sellers alternative calculation for each
disputed component. If the Seller does not deliver an Objection Notice to the
Purchaser within such 30-day period, then the Closing Statement and the
calculation of the Closing Working Capital set forth therein will be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

 

(c) If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve all disagreements
set forth in any Objection Notice within 15 days after delivery to the
Purchaser, then such disagreements will be resolved by BDO USA, LLP (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The scope of the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be limited to (i) a determination of whether the Final
Closing Working Capital related to the unresolved disagreements identified in
the Objection Notice was prepared based on and consistent with the methodology
and line items set forth in _Schedule A-4_ (and that each of the accounts set
forth on _Schedule A-4_ are calculated in accordance with GAAP) and applied in
a manner consistent, through all relevant periods, with the preparation of the
Seller Financial Statements as to accounting methods, policies, practices
and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodologies (except to the extent expressly modified by _Schedule A-4_ ),
(ii) based on its determinations of the matters described in clause (i), a
final calculation of the Final Closing Working Capital and (iii) an
allocation of its fees and expenses pursuant to the methodology prescribed by
this _Section 2.5(c)_. The Independent Accounting Firm is not to make or be
asked to make any determination other than as set forth in the previous
sentence. If BDO USA, LLP is not willing to serve as the Independent
Accounting Firm, then the Seller and the Purchaser will each submit to the
other Partys independent auditor the name of a nationally recognized (in the
United States) accounting firm (excluding either Partys independent auditor),
and the Independent Accounting Firm will be selected by lot from these two
firms by the independent auditors of the Parties. Any fees and expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of
its services pursuant to this _Section 2.5(c)_ will be allocated between the
Seller and the Purchaser such that the amount paid by the Seller bears the
same proportion that the aggregate Dollar amount unsuccessfully disputed by
the Seller bears to the total Dollar amount for the disputed items that were
submitted for resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Purchaser
will pay the balance; all other fees, expenses and costs incurred by the
Seller or the Purchaser in implementing the provisions of this _Section
2.5(c)_ will be borne by the Seller or the Purchaser, respectively. The
Independent Accounting Firm will be instructed to use Reasonable Efforts to
perform its services within 20 days of submission of the dispute to it and, in
any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. Following the
resolution of the dispute and determination by the Independent Accounting
Firm, which will be final and binding on all Parties, the Closing Statement
and the Final Closing Working Capital reflected thereon will be prepared by
the Parties based on such determination of the Independent Accounting Firm.

(d) If the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.5(b)_ or _Section 2.5(c)_ , as applicable (the " _Final Closing Working
Capital_ "), differs from the corresponding estimated figures set forth in the
Closing Estimate Certificate and used in the calculation of the Closing
Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then the Closing Purchase Price will be
recalculated using such final figures in lieu of such estimated figures and
the following adjustment (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") to the Closing
Purchase Price will be made:

 



7 (i) If the Closing Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_ is greater than the Closing Purchase Price paid at Closing, the
Purchaser will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller the amount of such
excess.

 

(ii) If the Closing Purchase Price as recalculated pursuant to this _Section
2.5_ is less than the Closing Purchase Price paid at Closing, the Seller will
pay, or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser the amount of such shortfall.

(iii) After the final determination of the Final Closing Working Capital and
Closing Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section 2.5_ , the Purchaser
or the Seller, as the case may be, will make payment to the other by wire
transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment as determined pursuant to the preceding subsections in accordance
with _Section_ _ _ _11.14_.

 

2.6. _Purchase Price Allocation_. If the Purchaser elects pursuant to _Section
9.8_ to make a Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Purchaser and the Seller
agree that all amounts properly treated as purchase price for the Purchased
Shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be allocated among the
Assets of the Acquired Companies in accordance with Section 338 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within four months following
the final determination of the Final Closing Working Capital, the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller an allocation of the Closing Purchase
Price (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Assumed Liabilities) (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be
prepared in accordance with applicable Law, including in accordance with
Sections 1060 and 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar Law, as appropriate). The Purchase Price
Allocation shall be final and binding on all parties unless, within 60 days
after delivery thereof to the Seller, the Seller delivers a written notice to
the Purchaser of its objections to the Purchase Price Allocation. The Seller
and the Purchaser shall use their Reasonable Efforts to resolve any disputed
items. If the Seller and the Purchaser cannot come to mutual agreement on
the Purchase Price Allocation, the matter shall be resolved in accordance
with substantially identical procedures as set forth for the resolution of
disputes in _Section 2.5(c)_. If the Seller raises no objection to the
Purchase Price Allocation or if all disputed items are resolved, such
Purchase Price Allocation (the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ ") shall be
binding on all parties for all Tax purposes, and the Purchaser, the Company,
and the Seller shall report, act, and file Tax Returns (including, but not
limited to, IRS Forms 8023, 8883, and 8594, as applicable) in all respects and
for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule. The Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller from time to time revised copies of
such Final Allocation Schedule so as to report any matters on the Final
Allocation Schedule that need updating. Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller
Group shall, nor shall they permit their respective Affiliates to, take
any position inconsistent with the Final Allocation Schedule on any
applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Tax authority. In the
event that the Final Allocation Schedule is disputed by any Taxing authority,
the Seller (if any Seller receives notice of such dispute) or the Purchaser
(if the Acquired Companies or the Purchaser receives notice of such dispute)
will promptly notify the other, and the Seller and the Purchaser will consult
in good faith as to how to resolve such dispute in a manner consistent with
such allocation.

 



8 2.7. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Law related to Taxes and to request any
reasonably necessary Tax forms including Form W-9 or any similar information
for the purpose of determining whether such withholding is required. The
applicable payor shall use good faith efforts to provide the applicable payee
with notice of such payors intention to withhold at least five Business Days
prior to any such withholding and each such payor and payee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute regarding whether such
withholding is required or otherwise minimize any such Taxes. In the event
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

has all organizational power and authority required to carry on its
operations, if any, and own its Assets, to the extent related to the Business.

(b) Each Acquired Company is a Business Entity that is duly incorporated or
organized, validly existing, and, to the extent applicable in its jurisdiction

constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, membership
interests or other equity interests of LandW. There are no authorized or
outstanding shares of capital stock, membership interests or other equity
interests of any Acquired Company, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such shares, membership interests or equity interests, and no
options, warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which any
Acquired Company is a party or which are binding upon such Acquired Company
providing for the issuance or redemption of any shares of such Acquired
Companys capital stock, membership interests or other equity interests, or

interests or equity interests. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(a)_ , no

and valid title to the Shares will pass to the Purchaser, free and clear of
all Encumbrances.

3.3. _Authorization_. The Seller has, and each member of the Seller Group, as
applicable, will have at the Closing, all power and authority it requires to
execute, consummate the transactions contemplated by and perform its
respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Each Transaction Agreement,
when delivered to the Purchaser, will be duly and validly executed by the
applicable member of the Seller Group and assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties thereto, each Transaction
Agreement will be a valid and binding obligation of each member of the Seller
Group that is a party thereto, enforceable against such member of the Seller
Group in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to
(a) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the
relief of debtors, and (b) rules of Law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

 

3.4. _No Conflict_. The execution, delivery and performance by each member of
the Seller Group of the Transaction Agreements to which it is party and the
consummation by each such member of the Seller Group of the Contemplated
Transactions, as applicable, do not and will not, as applicable, (a) conflict

Seller Group or any

 



10  Acquired Company to make any filing with, or obtain any Permit, consent or

HSR Act and any Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions outside the United States (if
and to the extent any of the foregoing Laws may apply), and (ii) where the
failure to obtain such Permit, consent or approval, or to make such filing,
would not prevent or materially delay the consummation by the Seller Group of
the Contemplated Transactions, or the performance by the Seller Group of any
of its obligations under the Transaction Agreements, (c) other than as set
forth in _Schedule 3.4_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, result in a breach

or both, (d) other than as set forth in _Schedule 3.4_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, result in the imposition of any Encumbrance upon the

the Acquired Companies and the results of their operations and cash flows in
accordance with GAAP as of the dates and for the periods indicated;
_provided_ , that the Business Financial Statements include allocations of
expenses from the Seller which may not be reflective of the actual level of
costs which would have been incurred had the Acquired Companies operated as a
separate entity apart from the Seller. Since the date of the Most Recent
Balance Sheet, there has not been any event that has had, or would reasonably
be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.5(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules and except as, and to the extent, reflected or reserved against in
the Business Financial Statements (including the notes thereto), there are no
Liabilities related to the Business, except for Liabilities: (i) incurred in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions (including all Liabilities
assumed by LandW pursuant to _Section 1.2(a)_ ); or (ii) incurred in the
Ordinary Course since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet.

 



11 (c) Since the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet, neither the Seller nor
any member of the Seller Group has caused any of the Acquired Companies to
incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become subject to any Liability that was
not related primarily to and incurred in connection with the conduct of the
Business in the Ordinary Course.

(f) No Acquired Company nor the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is required
to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from,

any Acquired Company that is currently in force.

(l) To the Sellers Knowledge, each Acquired Company has properly (i)

sales or similar Taxes, received and retained any appropriate Tax exemption

exclusively addressed in _Section 3.15_ ), (ii) as set forth on  _Schedule
3.7(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) record notices filed by
lessors of operating equipment leased by the Acquired Companies, each Acquired
Company has good, and valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all

Leased Real Property, together with (i) the Assets and rights identified on
_Schedule 3.7(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the services and
rights to be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement (assuming

Agreement and (iii) the licenses set forth in _Section_ _ _ _10.14(a)_ ),
constitute all of the Assets necessary to permit the Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies to conduct the Business following the Closing in
substantially the same manner as it has been conducted by the Seller and its

as of the extent applicable, the record owner, registration number,
registration or issue date, and application number and application date. The
Acquired Companies are, or as of the Closing will be, the sole and exclusive
owners of all right, title and interest in and to the Company Intellectual
Property, free and clear of any Encumbrance. Except as noted in _Schedule
3.8(a)_ (for pending registrations), all of the Company Intellectual Property

infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated, the Intellectual Property
Rights of any other Person and there is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to
the Sellers Knowledge, threatened against the Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) alleging the foregoing. No Legal Proceeding
is pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened regarding the validity,
enforceability, patentability, ability to register, use, ownership, or scope
of any Company Intellectual Property. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(c)_

(including the Acquired Companies) has brought or threatened to bring any

Transaction Agreements by the other parties thereto at the Closing, each

 



24  Transaction Agreement executed by the Purchaser will be a valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance
with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to (a) Laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and
(b) rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies.

 

4.3. _No Conflict_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser
of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions do not and will not, as applicable, (a) conflict with or violate
any provision of the Purchasers charter, bylaws or other organizational
documents, each as amended to date, (b) require the Purchaser to make any
filing with, or obtain any Permit, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity, except for the requirements of the HSR Act and any Antitrust Laws of
jurisdictions outside the United States (if and to the extent any of the
foregoing Laws may apply), (c) result in a breach or default under, create in
any Person the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel, or require
any notice, consent or waiver under, any agreement or instrument to which the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates is a party, in any case with or without
due notice or lapse of time or both, or (d) violate any Law or Order
applicable to the Purchaser.

 

4.4. _Legal Proceedings_. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the
Purchasers Knowledge, threatened by or against the Purchaser that questions
or challenges the validity of any Transaction Agreement or the ability of the
Purchaser to consummate any of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

4.5. _Availability of Funds; Financing_.

 

(a) Assuming the funding of the Debt Financing, the Purchaser has sufficient
cash available to enable it to pay the full Closing Purchase Price and to
make the other payments earned, due and payable in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions required to be paid by the Purchaser under this
Agreement, in each case, at the Closing hereunder, and to make any payments
required to be paid by the Purchaser resulting from the Post-Closing
Adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.5_

(b) The Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true and complete copy of (x) the
Commitment Letter dated as of the date hereof from Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch and Royal Bank of Canada (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") (including any related fee letters with only fee
amounts and percentages, pricing caps, market flex and securities demand
provisions and other economic, numerical or commercially sensitive terms
redacted) to the Purchaser pursuant to which the Lenders have committed to
provide the Purchaser with financing for the Contemplated Transactions in an
aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") (the entire
amount of which will be available under clause (x) of the definition of
"Incremental Amount" under (and as defined in) the Credit Agreement) and (y)
the Credit Agreement. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
each other Person party thereto (which, to the Purchasers Knowledge, is the
case), the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, and to the
Purchasers Knowledge, the other parties thereto, subject, as
to enforceability, to (a) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,

 



25  insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (b) rules of Law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies. There are
no side letters or other Contracts to which the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates is a party related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, and there are no conditions or contingencies to the availability of
the Debt Financing or the obligations of the Financing Sources party to the
Debt Commitment Letter to fund the Debt Financing, in each case other than (a)
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (b) which does not
expand the conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, in each case
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (c) as
expressly set forth in Sections 2.14(d) and 4.02 of the Credit Agreement or
(d) as expressly set forth in Section 7.02(i) of the Credit Agreement.
Satisfaction of the Exclusive Funding Conditions (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter) and the requirements of Section 7.02(i) of the Credit
Agreement will satisfy the conditions precedent to Sections 2.14(d) and 4.02
of the Credit Agreement without further act by any Person. There is no
requirement under Section 7.02(i) of the Credit Agreement that is required
under the Credit Agreement to be satisfied prior to the Closing Date other
than the absence of any "Event of Default" under (and as defined in) the
Credit Agreement, after giving pro forma effect to the Contemplated
Transactions, and no such "Event of Default" is continuing as of the date
hereof or will result from the Contemplated Transactions (including by reason
of any cross-default or similar provision). None of the provisions redacted in
the fee letter will limit, prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Debt Financing in any manner. As of the date hereof, the Purchaser has fully
paid any and all commitment fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be
paid as of the date hereof, and other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and related fee letter, no commitment or other fees will be required
to be paid by the Purchaser in respect of the Debt Financing at any time prior
to the Closing Date. The Purchaser is not required under any Material Debt
Document to comply with any financial covenant on or after the date hereof
and on or prior to the Effective Time or to comply with any financial covenant
or financial ratio to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions is not subject to the availability of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
breach, default or failure of a condition to the Debt Financing by the
Purchaser or, to the Purchasers Knowledge, any other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter under the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 

4.6. _Investment Purpose_. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own
account for investment and not with a view to, or for offer or resale in
connection with, a distribution of any of the Shares or any "beneficial
interest" in the Shares within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Purchaser has no
present intent, agreement or understanding to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of any Shares or any beneficial interest in any Shares to any other
Person. The Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any applicable state
securities laws, and that none of the Shares may be offered for sale, sold or
otherwise transferred unless they are registered or otherwise qualified under
federal and any applicable state securities Law or unless an exemption from
such registrations or qualifications is available.

 



26 4.7. _Brokers  Fees_. Neither the Purchaser, nor any of its Affiliates, has
any Liability to pay any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

4.8.  _Solvency_. Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of the
Purchaser to consummate the Contemplated Transactions have been satisfied or
waived, (b) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Acquired Companies
have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were, at the
time made, and continue to be, at the Effective Time, reasonable, (c) the most
recent Business Financial Statements fairly present the consolidated financial
condition of the Acquired Companies as of the end of the periods covered
thereby and the consolidated results of operation of the Acquired Companies
for the periods covered thereby, and (d) accuracy and completeness of the
representations and warranties in Article III, then as of the Closing Date
immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the Debt Financing and the
payment of related fees, expenses and other amounts required to be paid
on the Closing Date in connection with this Agreement and the Debt Financing,
the (a) the sum of the debt (including contingent liabilities) of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not exceed the present
fair saleable value (on a going concern basis) of the assets of the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the capital of the Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to
the business of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
contemplated as of the Closing Date; and (c) the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not intend to incur, or believe that they
will incur, debts including current obligations beyond their ability to pay
such debt as they mature in the ordinary course of business. For the purposes
hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed
as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at
such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an
actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such contingent
liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 5).

 

4.9. _Independent Investigation_. The Purchaser has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations,
Assets, Liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, intellectual
property, technology and prospects of the Acquired Companies and the Business,
which investigation, review and analysis was done by the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and Representatives. In entering into this Agreement, the Purchaser
acknowledges that it is an informed and sophisticated participant in the
Contemplated Transactions and has conducted all of the inquiries as it deemed
fit with respect to the Shares, the Business, the Acquired Companies, the
Assets of the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) other than
the Seller Representations, no member of the Seller Group, nor any of their
respective Representatives or Affiliates, make or have made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to the
Shares, the Business, the Acquired Companies, the Assets of the Acquired
Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities including as to (A)
merchantability or fitness for any particular use or purpose, (B) the
operation of the Business by the Purchaser after the Closing in any manner,
(C) the probable success or profitability of the Business after the Closing or
(D) the accuracy or completeness of any information concerning the Shares, the

 



27  Business, the Acquired Companies, the Assets of the Acquired Companies, the
Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities contained herein or made available
in connection with the Purchasers investigation of the Seller, (ii) the
Purchaser has not relied and is not relying on any statement, representation
or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the Seller or any
Acquired Company, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
except as expressly set forth in the Seller Representations, and (iii) no
member of the Seller Group, nor any of their respective Representatives or
Affiliates, will have or will be subject to any Liability or
indemnification obligation to the Purchaser or any other Person resulting
from the distribution, or failure to distribute, to the Purchaser, its
Representatives or Affiliates, or the Purchasers use of, any information
relating to the Business, the Acquired Companies, the Assets of the Acquired
Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, including any
descriptive memoranda, summary business descriptions or any information,
documents or material made available to the Purchaser or its Representatives
or Affiliates, whether orally or in writing, in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions, responses to
questions submitted on behalf of the Purchaser, due diligence reviews or in
any other form related to the Contemplated Transactions, including during the
negotiations of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

4.10. _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. The Purchaser
Representations are the only representations and warranties made by the
Purchaser, and the Seller has not relied and is not relying on any statement,
representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, except as expressly
set forth in this _Article_ _ _ _4_.

(a) Prior to or in connection with the Closing, each Party agrees not to issue
any press release or make any other public announcement relating to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements without the prior written

Agreement with the SEC (in which case the disclosing Party agrees to use

Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements, and the terms hereof and thereof
(including the exhibits, annexes and schedules attached hereto and thereto)

31 5.6. _Regulatory Filings; Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties agree
to use Reasonable Efforts to (i) make all necessary and appropriate filings
with all applicable Governmental Entities and obtain required approvals and
clearances with respect thereto, (ii) obtain all material waivers, approvals,
authorizations and Orders of any Person required in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions, and (iii) take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions
as promptly as practicable.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_ , each of the Seller
and the Purchaser agrees to (i) as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than the earlier of (A) the date legally
required for filing and (B) the tenth Business Day following the date of
execution and delivery of this Agreement (except as otherwise agreed by the
Parties), file any notification and report forms and related material that it
may be required to file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice under the
HSR Act and seek an early termination of the applicable waiting period, and
(ii) make any further filings or information submissions that may
be requested, necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to the HSR Act. In
addition, each Party agrees to file with the applicable Governmental Entity,
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in
no event later than the 30th day following the date of execution and delivery
of this Agreement, any filings or similar information submissions required
under any other applicable United States federal or state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, Orders, administrative or judicial doctrines or
other Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
constituting anticompetitive conduct (collectively, together with the HSR
Act, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "). Each Party will promptly notify the other
Party of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Entity relating to the Contemplated Transactions, and will
permit the other Party to review in advance, if possible, any proposed
communication by such Party to any Governmental Entity. Neither Party will
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the
other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other Party and, if requested by such other Party, its
outside counsel, a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. The Parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other Party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act.
Each Party will provide to counsel for the other Party copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement, each Party will be solely responsible for all fees required
to be paid by them in accordance with the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws,
including in jurisdictions outside of the United States of America in
connection with the filings described above.

 



32 (d) Without limiting the generality of _Sections 5.6(a)_ and _(b)_ , the
Purchaser and the Seller will each (i) use its best efforts (subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 5.6(e)_ ) to achieve "substantial
compliance" as promptly as practicable with any request for additional
information or documentary material issued by a Governmental Entity under 15
U.S.C. § 18a(e) and in conjunction with the Contemplated Transactions (a "
_Second Request_ "), (ii) certify "substantial compliance" with any Second
Request as promptly as practicable after the date of such Second Request,
(iii) take all actions necessary to assert, defend and support its
certification of "substantial compliance" with such Second Request, and (iv)
not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement
with such Governmental Entities or other authorities to delay or otherwise not
to consummate as soon as practicable any of the Contemplated Transactions
except with the prior written consent of the other Party hereto, which
consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the non-requesting Party.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the Purchasers undertaking pursuant
to _Sections 5.6(a)_  _(d)_ , the Purchaser agrees to use its best efforts
(subject to the limitations set forth in the last sentence of this _Section
5.6(e)_ ), and to take any and all steps necessary, to eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that
is asserted by any Governmental Entity (through the Head of the Governmental
Entity or Division thereof) or any other party so as to enable the Parties to
cause the Closing to occur prior to the Termination Date, including: (i)
negotiating, committing to and effecting by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of the
Acquired Companys properties or the Businesses to be acquired by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Assets of the Purchaser), as are necessary in order to resolve concerns
expressed by any Governmental Entity or effect the dissolution of any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the
Termination Date; and (ii) defending through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring prior
to the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such litigation in no
way limits the obligation of the Purchaser to use its best efforts (subject to
the limitations set forth in the last sentence of this _Section 5.6(e)_ ),
and to take any and all steps necessary, to eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions prior to the Termination Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including this
_Section 5.6_ , in no event will the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be
required to (A) divest or hold separate any portion of the Assets of the
Acquired Companies or the Business representing, in the aggregate, in excess
of $150,000,000 of revenue generated by the Acquired Companies between (and
inclusive of) January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015 or (B) otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits the Purchasers or any of its
Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, the
Business or the Assets of the Acquired Companies to the extent such
restrictions would reasonably be expected to reduce the revenue of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates by over $150,000,000 in any 12-month period. For
avoidance of doubt, except as expressly set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, in no event will the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies) be required to divest or hold separate any portion of
its or their Assets or take any action that limits in any way Purchasers or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) freedom of action
with respect to, or their ability to retain, the Business or its or their
Assets.

 



33 5.7. _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Without limiting any other
provision of this Agreement requiring a different standard of efforts or the
taking of specified actions, the Parties agree to use Reasonable Efforts to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the conditions precedent that are set
forth in  _Article_ _ _ _6_ , and the Parties will use Reasonable Efforts to
cause the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated.

 

5.8. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the
Acquired Companies and each member of the Seller Group with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions.

5.9. _Replacement of Seller Guarantees_.

(a) The Seller and its Affiliates have provided the corporate guarantees
(including parent company guarantees), or have obtained certain performance
and indemnity bonds and letters of credit set forth on _Schedule 5.9_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Seller Guarantees_ "). After the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, any Seller Guarantor may, subject to the
Purchasers prior written consent, in the Ordinary Course issue additional
Seller Guarantees on commercially reasonable terms in connection with certain
obligations of the Business. The obligations of the Purchaser with regard to
the Seller Guarantees set forth in this Agreement will apply (i) to those
Seller Guarantees in existence as of the date hereof and set forth on
_Schedule 5.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and (ii) to those Seller
Guarantees provided or obtained after the date hereof in accordance with the
provisions of the previous sentence.

(b) Except with respect to any Seller Guarantees related to the installation
of any Products, the Purchaser will (and will cause its Affiliates to) (i)
cooperate with the Seller in the Sellers efforts to, and (ii) use Reasonable
Efforts (in connection with such cooperation with the Seller) to: (A) replace
the Seller Guarantees (solely to the extent such Seller Guarantee is related
to the Acquired Companies); and/or (B) release the Seller Guarantors from the
Seller Guarantees (solely to the extent such Seller Guarantee is related to
the Acquired Companies), in each case to be effective as of the Closing Date.
The Seller will, or will cause its affiliates to, use Reasonable Efforts to
notify the Purchaser prior to making any payment under a Seller Guarantee
after the Closing, provided that failure to give such notice will not impact
the Purchasers obligations under this _Section 5.9_. The Purchaser agrees,
unconditionally and irrevocably, without right of setoff, to reimburse the
Seller Guarantors (other than the Acquired Companies), for and against all
their payments actually paid after the Closing pursuant to any Seller
Guarantees (solely to the extent such Seller Guarantee is related to the
Acquired Companies). The Purchasers obligations pursuant to the preceding
sentence will not be subject to any limitations set forth in _Article 8_. All
such reimbursements by the Purchaser will be made promptly after receipt by it
of written notice from the Seller that a Seller Guarantor has made any such
payment together with reasonable evidence of the amount and reason for such
payment. To the extent a Seller Guarantor has performance obligations under
such Seller Guarantees, the Purchaser will use Reasonable Efforts to (1)
perform such obligations on behalf of the Seller Guarantor (solely to the
extent

 



34  such Seller Guarantee is related to the Acquired Companies) or (2) otherwise
take such action as reasonably requested by the Seller so as to put the Seller
Guarantor in the same position as if the Purchaser, and not the Seller
Guarantor, had performed or were performing such obligations (solely to the
extent such Seller Guarantee is related to the Acquired Companies). Neither
the Seller nor any of its Affiliates will have any obligation to renew any
Seller Guarantees issued on behalf of any Acquired Company after the
expiration of any such Seller Guarantee.

 

5.10. _Libertyville Lease_. Prior to Closing, the Seller will use Reasonable
Efforts (at the Sellers sole cost and expense) to cause LandW to be removed as
a tenant from that certain lease between ARC HRPBPCC001, LLC, as landlord and
the Seller, United States Gypsum Company, USG Interiors, LLC and LandW,
collectively as tenant, for the premises at 700 N. Highway 45, Libertyville,
Illinois.

5.11. _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall
use Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary to (i) maintain in full force and
effect (x) the Credit Agreement and (y) the Debt Commitment Letter and any
related material definitive documentation (collectively, the "
_Debt Financing Documents_ ") until the funding of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex"
provisions of the related fee letter (the " _Debt Financing Fee Letter_ "))
and shall not permit, without the prior written consent of the Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), any
amendment or modification to be made to or any waiver of any material
provision under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing Documents or
the Credit Agreement if such amendment, modification or waiver would (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, unless the Purchaser
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Seller that, after giving
effect to such reduction, the amount of the Debt Financing is sufficient to
meet the Purchasers payment obligations necessary to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions (and the Purchasers representation under _Section
4.5(a)_ hereof shall be deemed to have been made with respect to the Debt
Financing as so reduced) or (B) impose material new or material additional
conditions or otherwise materially amend, modify or expand any conditions to
the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (1) materially delay (taking into account the Marketing Period) or
prevent the Closing, (2) materially adversely impact in any material respect
the ability of the Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing on the Closing Date
on the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter or (3) materially and adversely
affect the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation to be
entered into in connection therewith (provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else in this Agreement, no consent from the Seller shall
be required for any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the
Debt Commitment Letter to (x) increase the commitments or the amount of
indebtedness thereunder or (y) modify pricing and implement or exercise any of
the "market flex" provisions contemplated by the Debt Financing Fee Letter),
(ii) negotiate and enter into the Debt Financing Documents on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Financing Fee Letter (or

 



35  on such other terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Lenders so long as such other terms or conditions would be permitted
by this Agreement as an amendment to the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the
Debt Financing Fee Letter), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) all of the conditions to
the Debt Financing (other than any condition (x) to the extent the failure to
be so satisfied is a result of the Sellers or its Affiliates failure to
comply with subsection (d) below or any other provision of this Agreement,
including _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ or (y) which is waived), and (iv)
subject to satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Financing Fee Letter and the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ , to consummate the Debt Financing no later than the
date on which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to this Agreement. The
Purchaser (i) shall ensure that, commencing on the date hereof and continuing
until the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, no Credit
Agreement Default exists and (ii) shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain all
consents or waivers necessary to effect the waiver of any Credit Agreement
Default that exists despite the Purchasers obligation under the foregoing
clause (i). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained herein shall require, and in no event shall the
Reasonable Efforts of the Purchaser be deemed or construed to require, the
Purchaser to (A) pay any fees, any interest rates or other amounts applicable
to the Debt Financing (other than waiver, amendment or similar fees incurred
in connection with any waiver of any Credit Agreement Default as contemplated
by clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) that are, in the aggregate, in
excess of the aggregate amount of fees, interest and other amounts
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Fee Letter
(including, and after giving effect to, the flex provisions) or agree to any
"market flex" or other term or condition less favorable to the Purchaser than
such corresponding terms contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter (including, and after giving effect
to, the flex provisions) (in either case, whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise), (B) agree to waive any condition
or term of this Agreement or amend any term or condition of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Fee Letter, (C) agree to any terms that
are, taken in the aggregate, outside of, or less favorable than, any
applicable provisions, taken in the aggregate, contained in or contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter (including the
flex provisions) or (D) initiate, prosecute or maintain any Legal Proceeding
against any Lenders or other Persons providing the Debt Financing or Persons
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Fee Letter.
References in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Fee Letter
as permitted to be amended or modified by this _Section 5.11(a)_
and references to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing Fee
Letter shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified by
this _Section 5.11(a)_.

 

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, regardless of the
reason therefor (other than a breach by the Seller of this Agreement or
failure of any conditions precedent set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section
6.3_ to be satisfied), the Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted under the
Debt Commitment Letter, use Reasonable Efforts to arrange and obtain, at its
sole expense, alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and
conditions that are no less favorable (including with respect to
conditionality), in the aggregate, to the Purchaser than those set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter on the date hereof, in an amount, together

 



36  with proceeds then available to the Purchaser, sufficient to provide
substitute financing for such portion as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event but in no event later than the date on which the
Closing is scheduled to occur pursuant to the terms hereof (taking into
account the Marketing Period). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.11_ will require, and
in no event will the Reasonable Efforts of the Purchaser be deemed or
construed to require, the Purchaser to pay any fees or any interest rates in
excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any fee letters
related to the Debt Financing (whether to secure waiver of any conditions
contained therein or otherwise), as determined by the Purchaser in its
reasonable judgment. The Purchaser shall promptly provide a true, correct and
complete copy of any alternative financing commitment (together with a copy
of any related fee letter with only the fee amounts and percentages, pricing
caps, market flex and securities demand provisions and other economic,
numerical or commercially sensitive terms redacted) to the Seller, and, to
the extent applicable, thereafter for the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the
term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter
or similar agreement, together with such redacted fee letter (which shall be
deemed to be included in the term "Debt Financing Fee Letter") (with only fee
amounts and percentages, pricing caps, market flex and securities demand
provisions and other economic, numerical or commercially sensitive
terms redacted), with respect to any alternative debt financing arranged in
compliance herewith and (ii) the term "Lenders" shall be deemed to include any
lenders providing the alternative debt financing arranged in compliance
herewith.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall give the Seller reasonably prompt notice of (i) any
material breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which the
Purchaser becomes aware, or any other fact, event or circumstance, in each
case to the extent it would materially impair or delay the Closing or result
in insufficient financing to meet the Purchasers payment obligations
necessary to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and (ii) any
termination or repudiation of, or material dispute relating to, the Debt
Commitment Letter of which the Purchaser becomes aware.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause the members of the
Seller Group and the Acquired Companies to, use, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the officers, employees, advisors and other
Representatives of the Seller, the Seller Group and the Acquired Companies to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions to provide to the Purchaser, at
the Purchasers sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by the
Purchaser that is necessary and customary in connection with the Purchasers
efforts to obtain the Debt Financing, including (i) participating, to the
extent reasonably requested by the Purchaser or the Lenders (by management
teams with appropriate seniority), in a reasonable number (but no more than
one meeting and to the extent necessary, one or more conference calls in
addition to such meeting) of meetings (including customary lender meetings
between senior management of the Acquired Companies and the parties acting as
lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders for, the Debt
Financing), due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Debt Financing at reasonable times and locations mutually
agreed, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Acquired Companies to
execute documents, including agreements, documents or certificates
(including insurance) that facilitate the creation, perfection or enforcement
of liens securing the Debt Financing as requested by the Purchaser or the
providers of Debt Financing, in each case in form and

 



37  substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Lenders; provided
that no obligation of the Seller or the Seller Group under any such agreements
or documents shall be effective until the Closing Date, (iii) if reasonably
requested in writing at least 10 days prior to Closing, providing at least two
Business Days prior to Closing, and as reasonably requested by the Purchaser,
all documentation and other information with respect to the Seller, the
Seller Group and their respective Affiliates that any Lender has determined is
required by regulatory authorities in connection with applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
Patriot Act, (iv) preventing the offer, placement or arrangement of any debt
securities or bank or other credit facilities by or on behalf of the Acquired
Companies (other than Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies permitted to
be incurred under this Agreement) and (v) taking corporate action (subject to
the occurrence of the Closing) reasonably necessary to permit the consummation
of the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) nothing in this
subsection (d) shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, (B) nothing in this subsection (d) shall require the Seller,
the Seller Group or any of the Acquired Companies to incur any liability, or
enter into any binding agreement, that is not contingent upon, or that would
be effective prior to, the Closing, (C) nothing in this subsection (d) shall
require any cooperation or actions that the Seller reasonably believes would
result in a violation of any confidentiality arrangement or similar agreement
or the loss of any attorney-client or other similar privilege (provided, that
the Seller shall (x) use reasonable best efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege or confidentiality
arrangement or other agreement in a manner so as to preserve any applicable
privilege and (y) notify the Purchaser of any disclosure that it is not
required to make, and is not making, pursuant to this clause (C) so long as
such notification does not violate the terms of such confidentiality
arrangement or result in the loss of any attorney-client or other similar
privilege), (D) nothing in this subsection (d) shall require the Seller, the
Seller Group or any of the Acquired Companies to make any representation or
warranty in connection with the Debt Financing or the marketing or
arrangement thereof (except, in the case of the Acquired Companies and the
Business, any such representation or warranty that is effective only at or
following the Closing), and (E) neither the Seller nor the Seller Group
(excluding the Acquired Companies) shall have any obligations under this
subsection (d) following the Closing. The condition set forth in _Section
6.2(b)_ , as it applies to the Sellers obligations under this subsection (d),
shall be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Sellers knowing
and intentional material breach of its obligations under this subsection (d).
The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives
or agents from and against any and all Damages (which, the Seller agrees,
shall not include Damages related to loss of any benefit to the Seller of the
transactions contemplated hereby) suffered or incurred by any of them to any
Lender in connection with any of their cooperation or assistance with respect
to the Debt Financing or the provision of any information utilized
in connection therewith or otherwise arising from the Debt Financing, other
than any Damages resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents. The Purchaser
shall, reasonably promptly after written request by the Seller, reimburse the
Seller and its Affiliates for any and all

 



38  reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses (including
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of counsel, accountants and other advisors
to the Seller and its Affiliates) incurred by it in connection with any
provision of information or any cooperation or assistance, in each case, with
respect to the Debt Financing as set forth in this subsection (d) to the
extent such fees, costs or expenses are incurred prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall have no obligation to reimburse
for the preparation or delivery of any annual audited or quarterly unaudited
financial statements.

 

(e) The Seller hereby consents to the use of its, the Acquired Companies, the
Business and the Seller Groups logos in connection with the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not
intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect
the Acquired Companies, the Business, the Seller or the Seller Group. The
Seller shall deliver customary payoff letters, lien terminations and
instruments of discharge on or prior to the Closing Date to allow for the
payoff, discharge and termination in full of all Indebtedness and liens
incurred by or attaching to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Acquired
Companies to be extinguished on the Closing Date and which otherwise provide
for the discharge, termination and release of the Business, the Acquired
Assets and the Acquired Companies from all obligations under the Sellers,
and their respective Subsidiaries credit facilities and other Indebtedness
(including as described in _Section 6.1(c)_ ); provided that the Seller shall
deliver drafts of payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of
discharge, that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser or the Lenders at
least 15 days prior to the Closing Date, at least five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

 

5.12. _Exclusivity_. No member of the Seller Group shall (and the Seller shall
cause its Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Representatives not to), directly or
indirectly, (a) submit, solicit, initiate or encourage any proposal or offer
from any Person (other than the Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions) or enter into any agreement or accept any
offer relating to or consummate any (i) reorganization, liquidation,
dissolution or recapitalization of the Business or the Acquired Companies,
(ii) merger or consolidation involving the Business or the Acquired
Companies, (iii) purchase or sale of any Assets, capital stock, membership
interests or other equity interests (or any rights to acquire, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, any such capital stock, membership
interests or other equity interests) of the Business or the Acquired
Companies, other than (with respect to Assets) any purchases or sales in the
Ordinary Course of Business, or (iv) similar transaction or business
combination involving the Business or the Acquired Companies or (b) furnish
any information with respect to, assist or participate in or facilitate in any
other manner any effort or attempt by any Person (other than Purchaser and its
Affiliates) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing. If any of the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are breached and the Contemplated
Transactions are not consummated as a result of such breach, Seller shall
promptly reimburse the Purchaser for all out of pocket fees and expenses
incurred before or after the date of this Agreement by Purchaser and its
Affiliates related to the Contemplated Transactions, including fees and
expenses of Representatives retained by the Purchaser and its Affiliates in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. With respect to the Persons
with whom discussions or negotiations have been terminated with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, Seller shall promptly request the return or
destruction of, in accordance with the terms of an applicable confidentiality
agreement, any confidential information previously furnished to any such
Person by any Seller Party or any of their respective Representatives.

 



39 5.13. _Notices from Material Customers_. From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing, if (a) any Acquired Company Officer, officer of the Seller or
regional manager of an Acquired Company receives written notice from any
Material Customer explicitly stating such Material Customers intent to cancel
or otherwise terminate or adversely modify its relationship with respect to
the Business, and (b) neither Seller, nor the applicable Acquired Company, is
obligated, pursuant to such notice or any other Contract with the applicable
Material Customer, to keep the terms or existence of such written notice
confidential, then the Seller will use Reasonable Efforts to notify the
Purchaser of such written notice and the contents thereof.

 

5.14. _Claims Reserves_. No more than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Seller will review all claims and incurred but not reported trends in
order to equitably adjust the liability for claims reserves to be reflected in
Closing Working Capital to reflect developments that reasonably should result
in an adjustment with respect to events arising after the last reserve
estimate.

5.15. _Adjustments for Specified Indemnities_. Prior to the Closing, Seller
will, and will cause LandW to, transfer to Seller the reimbursement receivable
and corresponding liability reflected on the Business Financial Statements and
related to the matter described in clause (d) of the definition of "Specified
Legal Proceedings". At the Closing, Seller will cause any reserves on the
books of the Acquired Companies for the Specified Legal Proceedings or the
matters identified on _Schedule 8.2(d)_ to be reduced to zero.

not occurred by March 31, 2017 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,

11.13_ , under no circumstances shall the Seller be permitted or entitled to
receive both specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section
11.13(b)_ and the Termination Fee. Except as provided in _Section 7.3(a)_ , in
no event shall Seller or any of the Seller Related Parties seek or obtain, nor
shall they permit any of their Representatives or any other Person on their
behalf to seek or obtain, nor shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain,
collectively any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Termination Fee
against the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Related Parties for, or with
respect to, any valid termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_. Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount
of the Termination Fee, and without in any way increasing the amount of the
Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
to be paid, each Party confirms that (i) each event or circumstance giving
rise to the obligation to pay the Termination Fee would cause
significant damage to the Seller and its Affiliates that would be inherently
difficult to quantify and prove, (ii) the Termination Fee provided for
hereunder is intended to provide fair compensation in response to that damage,
is not intended to be punitive, and is reasonable in amount in relation to
the circumstances under which it would become payable, and (iii) the
Termination Fee is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Without
limiting any other rights of the Seller hereunder, if the Purchaser fails to
pay the Termination Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Seller commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a final, binding and non-
appealable judgment against the Purchaser for the Termination Fee, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, together with the Termination Fee, interest
on the Termination Fee from the date of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 11.14_.

7.4. _Nonexclusivity of Termination Rights_. Other than as specifically set
forth in _Section 7.3_ , exercise by any Party of its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ will not be deemed to be an election of
remedies and will not be deemed to prejudice, or to constitute or operate as
a waiver of, any other right or remedy that such Party may be entitled to
exercise (whether under this Agreement, under any other Contract, under any
statute, rule or other Laws, at common law, in equity or otherwise).

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1.  _Survival_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement, or any instrument delivered by the Parties pursuant to this
Agreement, will survive the Closing and terminate on the date that is 18
months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing and terminate on
the six-year anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if notice of a claim for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_
shall have been provided to the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may
be, within the applicable survival period, in accordance with _Section 8.4_ ,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, any representations or
warranties that are the subject of such claim for indemnification that would
otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_ shall survive as to
such claim, and that claim only, until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

 

(b) The covenants and other agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
(or, if no survival period is specified, indefinitely); _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify for, and
will have no liability for, any breach of, or failure to perform,
any covenant, obligation or other agreement unless a Claim Notice in
accordance with _Section 8.4_ regarding such claim is given to the
Indemnifying Party no later than the close of business on the 12-month
anniversary of (x) the Closing Date, for any covenant or other agreement that
by its terms was to be performed prior to the Closing, and (y) the date such
breach or failure to perform first occurred, for any covenant or agreement
that remains in full force and effect after the Closing and (ii) if written
notice of a claim for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_
shall have been provided to the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be,
within the applicable survival period (including, with respect to covenants,
obligations and agreements, as provided in the preceding _clause (i)_ ), in
good faith and in accordance with _Section 8.4_ , then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary above, any matters, covenants or agreements that are
the subject of such claim for indemnification that would otherwise terminate
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall survive as to such claim, and that
claim only, until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

8.2. _Indemnification by the Seller_. Following the Closing, and subject to
the limitations expressly set forth in  _Section_ _ _ _8.5_ hereof, the
Seller will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser and its
directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against all Damages (other than Damages
with respect to Excluded Taxes, for which the provisions of _Section_ _ _
_9.1(a)_ will govern) incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of or
resulting from the following:

 

(a) any breach of any representation, or warranty of the Seller set forth in
this Agreement or any instrument delivered by the Seller pursuant hereto;

(b) any breach of any covenant of the Seller set forth in this Agreement;

 



45 (c) Specified Legal Proceedings; and

 

(d) the matters identified on _Schedule 8.2(d)_.

 

8.3. _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Following the Closing, and subject to
the limitations expressly set forth in  _Section_ _ _ _8.5_ hereof, the
Purchaser will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its
directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against all Damages (other than Damages with
respect to Taxes, for which the provisions of _Section_ _ _ _9.1(b)_ will
govern) incurred by the Seller Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from
the following:

 

(a) any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Purchaser
set forth in this Agreement or any instrument delivered by the Purchaser
pursuant hereto;

(b) any Assumed Liability; and

 

(c) the operation of the Business following the Closing.

 

8.4. _Claim Procedure_.

 

(a) _Claim Notice_. A party that seeks indemnity under this _Article_ _ _ _8_
or _Article 9_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") will give prompt written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from whom indemnification is sought (an "
_Indemnifying Party_ "). The Claim Notice shall contain (i) a reasonably
detailed description and, if known, estimated amount (the " _Claimed Amount_
") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis for
the Claim Notice to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party (including
any supporting documents required by _Section 8.4(d)_ ), and (iii) a demand
for payment of those Damages, _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay
or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
hereunder except to the extent (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying
Partys ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle such claim is actually
prejudiced by such delay or deficiency.

(b) _Response to Notice of Claim_. Within 45 days after delivery of a Claim
Notice, the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written
response (the " _Response_ ") in which the Indemnifying Party may:

 

(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, and, within five Business Days of the Indemnified Partys receipt of
the Response, the Indemnifying Party will pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;

 

(ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount (such portion, the " _Agreed Portion_ "), and,
within five Business Days of the Indemnified Partys receipt of the Response,
the Indemnifying Party will pay the Agreed Portion to the Indemnified Party in
accordance with a payment and distribution method reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party; or

 



46 (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of
the Claimed Amount.

If no Response is delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
within such 45 day period, then the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
disputed that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount.

(c) _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party disputes (or is deemed to
have disputed) the Claimed Amount, or any portion thereof, pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_ , such Dispute will be governed by, and subject to the terms
of,  _Section_ _ _ _11.1_.

(d) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) If the Indemnified Party receives notice or otherwise learns of the
assertion by a Person other than a Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
of any claim, suit, audit or other proceeding (including any Tax Contest,
governmental investigation or grand jury investigation) with respect to which
the Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this
_Article_ _ _ _8_ or _Article 9_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party will provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly. Such
Claim Notice will be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation
submitted by such Third Party (to the extent then in the possession of the
Indemnified Party) and will describe in reasonable detail the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the
claimed Damages (in each case to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable
by the Indemnified Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or
deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
hereunder except to the extent (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying
Partys ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle such Third Party Claim is
actually prejudiced by such delay or deficiency.

(ii) Within 30 days after receipt of such notification pursuant to _Section
8.4(d)(i)_ , the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, strictly at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party;  _provided_ that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party to the extent
that (1) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation (other than with respect to the matters contemplated by
_Section 8.2(c)_ and _Section 8.2(d)_ ); (2) the control of such defense by
the Indemnifying Party would limit the Purchasers ability to make any claims
or receive any recoveries under the Rep and Warranty Policy; (3) the Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party;
(4) the Indemnified Party has been advised by outside legal counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; (5) upon petition by the
Indemnified Party an appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; (6)

 



47  the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with a Material
Customer (other than those set forth on _Schedule 8.4(d)(ii)_ ) and does not
relate to or involve any Product of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies) or Material Supplier; or (7) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes, based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that the
Damages related to the Third Party Claim will exceed the maximum amount that
the Indemnifying Party will be liable for under the applicable provisions of
_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ , as applicable, and subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 8.5_. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume
control of such defense or notifies the Indemnified Party that it is reserving
any rights with respect to its obligations thereto, the Indemnified Party will
be entitled to control such defense. All recovery of any attorney fees, court
costs and similar expenses as a result of any such Third Party Claim will
belong solely to the Party that bore such cost or expense. The provisions of
this _Section 8.4(d)(ii)_ shall not apply to the matters covered by
_Sections 8.2(c)_.

(iii) The Party not controlling such defense (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ")
may participate therein at its own expense, subject to any limitations that
are reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege or Third Party
confidentiality. The Party controlling such defense (the " _Controlling Party_
") will keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably advised of the status of
such claim, suit, audit or proceeding and the defense thereof (subject to any
limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege
or Third Party confidentiality), and will consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party with respect thereto. The
Non-Controlling Party will furnish the Controlling Party with such information
as it may have with respect to such Third Party Claim (including copies of
any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such
party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise cooperate with and
assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim.

(iv) Except with respect to the Specified Legal Proceedings, if the
Indemnifying Party shall control the Third Party Claims, the Indemnifying
Party will not agree (or allow any Affiliate to agree) to any settlement of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the consent of the Indemnified Party will not be required if: (A) such
settlement or judgment only involves the payment of money and no injunctive
or other equitable relief, (B) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay
all amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment (to the extent
indemnifiable pursuant to this Agreement) and (C) such settlement or judgment
includes a full, complete and unconditional release, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, of the Indemnified Party from
further Liability with respect to the Third Party Claim for which indemnity
is provided under _Articles 8_ or _9_.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
will have the right and the obligation, to control the defense (including the
selection of counsel in its reasonable discretion (consistent with
the Sellers historic practices with respect to the

 



48  retention of counsel in such matters) of any Specified Legal Proceedings).
Additionally, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
contained in this _Section 8.4_ will limit the Sellers rights contained in
_Section 10.3_ with respect to the Specified Legal Proceedings and each of the
matters set forth in _Schedule 8.2(d)_.

 

8.5. _Limitations_.

(a) Notwithstanding _Section 8.2_ , the Seller shall not be required to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees in respect of any Damages subject to
indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ (i) unless the Damages associated with
any single claim (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations)
exceed $10,000 and (ii) unless and until the aggregate of all Damages subject
to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ and not subject to the preceding
clause (i) (other than with respect to Fundamental Representations) exceeds
$5,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Seller shall only be
required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for Damages in excess, and
only in excess, of the Deductible up to an additional $5,000,000 (the " _Cap_
"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the Deductible and
the Cap shall not apply to Damages to the extent such Damages arise from any
claim for indemnification with respect to a Fundamental Representation or for
indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.2(b)_ , _8.2(c)_ , or _8.2(d)_ ; and
(B) in no event will the Sellers aggregate Liability for any and all matters
under or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions exceed 100% of the Closing Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ ).

 

(b) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided pursuant
to _Articles_ _ _ _8_ or _9_ will be net of any amounts of any insurance
proceeds, payments or reimbursements to the extent actually received by, or
paid in kind to, the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, with respect
to such Damages (in each case, net of any deductible, costs and expenses
actually incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount). In
connection therewith, if, at any time following payment in full by the
Indemnifying Party of any amounts of Damages due hereunder, the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, receives any insurance proceeds, payments or
reimbursements with respect to such Damages, the Indemnified Party will
promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements (in each case, net of any deductible, costs and expenses
actually incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount) in an
amount not to exceed the amount of the corresponding indemnification payment
made by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnified Party will be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any
Damages to the extent such Person has been indemnified or reimbursed for
such Damages under any other provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement (including to the extent such indemnification or
reimbursement was included as a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Closing
Working Capital). An Indemnified Party will take all steps to mitigate to the
extent required by Delaware Law, the applicable indemnifiable Damages.

(c) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no Party will be liable
to any other Party, including in connection with any indemnification
obligation pursuant to _Articles_ _ _ _8_ or _9_ , for any punitive Damages,
except to the extent such Damages have been awarded or paid in connection
with a Third Party Claim.

 



49 (d) _Disregard for Qualification as to Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, except with respect to _Section 3.5(a)_
(it being agreed that, for purposes of the second sentence thereof, "in all
material respects" shall have the same meaning as such phrase has in the
Opinion of Deloitte and Touche LLP dated June 28, 2016 with respect to the
consolidated audited financial statements of LandW and its Subsidiaries),
_Section 3.8(a)_ , _Section 3.11(a)_ , the last sentence of _Section 3.13(e)_
, _Section 3.14(f)_ and each reference to "Material Contracts," "Material
Customers" and "Material Suppliers" in _Article 3_ (for example, the term
"Material Contract" shall not be read as "Contract"), for purposes of
determining whether any representation or warranty has been breached and the
amount of Damages arising therefrom, each representation and warranty in this
Agreement and the schedules and exhibits hereto shall be read without
regard and without giving effect to the terms "material," "in all material
respects," "Material Adverse Effect," or similar words or phrases contained in
such representation or warranty (as if such words or phrases were deleted
from such representation and warranty).

(e) _Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (including any survival periods applicable to the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, any limitations on
remedies or recoveries, any disclaimers of reliance or any similar limitations
or disclaimers (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those limitations or
disclaimers set forth in _Sections 8.5_ and _8.6_ ), nothing in this Agreement
(or elsewhere) shall limit or restrict any Indemnified Partys rights or
ability to maintain or recover any amounts in connection with any fraud.

8.6. _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Except (i) as otherwise set forth in this Agreement (including _Section
2.5_ ) or (ii) as set forth in the Transaction Agreements, following the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of any Purchaser Indemnitee with
respect to any monetary Damages arising in connection with the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement will be pursuant to the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Section_ _ _ _8.2_ and _Section_ _
_ _9.1(a)_. Except as contemplated in this _Article_ _ _ _8_ and _Article_ _ _
_9_ or as otherwise set forth herein, following the Closing, the Seller will
not have any Liability under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing will not (i) prohibit the Purchaser from seeking injunctive relief
in accordance with _Section 11.13_ from a court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent any failure or breach or to specifically enforce this Agreement or any
of the terms or provisions hereof or (ii) interfere with the dispute
resolution process set forth in _Section 2.5(c)_.

(b) Except (i) as otherwise set forth in this Agreement (including _Section
2.5_ ) or (ii) as set forth in the Transaction Agreements, following the
Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of any Seller Indemnitee with respect
to any monetary Damages arising in connection with the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement will be pursuant to
the indemnification obligations set forth in _Section_ _ _ _8.3_ and
_Section_ _ _ _9.1(b)_. Except as contemplated in this _Article_ _ _ _8_ and
_Article_ _ _ _9_ or as otherwise set forth herein, following the Closing,
the Purchaser will not have any Liability under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing will not (i) prohibit the Seller from seeking
injunctive relief in accordance with  _Section 11.13_ from a court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or to specifically
enforce this Agreement or any of the terms or provisions thereof or (ii)
interfere with the dispute resolution process set forth in  _Section 2.5(c)_.

 



50 8.7. _Exercise of Remedies by Persons Other than the Parties_. No Purchaser
Indemnitee (other than the Purchaser or any successor or assignee of the
Purchaser) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this
Agreement unless the Purchaser (or any successor or assignee of the Purchaser)
consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim. No Seller Indemnitee
(other than the Seller or any successor or assignee of the Seller) is entitled
to assert any indemnification claim under this Agreement unless the Seller (or
any successor or assignee of the Seller) consents to the assertion of the
indemnification claim.

8.8. _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller and each member of the Seller
Group (each a " _Seller Releasor_ "), on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
legal representatives, successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and
forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the
Acquired Companies and each of their respective past, present or
future officers, managers, directors, shareholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, employees, counsel and agents (each an " _Acquired Company
Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all Claims which such Seller
Releasor or its Affiliates, legal representatives, successors or assigns ever
had, now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing
whatsoever arising out of the operation of the Business or the ownership by
the Seller Group of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing Date,
excluding (i) Claims for amounts owed, or that become owed, by an Acquired
Company in connection with any Acquired Companys purchase of Products or
Services from Seller or any of its Affiliates in the Ordinary Course prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) Claims made in connection with any of the
intercompany arrangements set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ (the " _Released
Matters_ "). Each Seller Releasor agrees not to, and agrees to cause its
respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries not to, assert any Claim against the
Acquired Company Releasees with respect to the Released Matters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller Releasor and its respective
Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and assigns retain all of, do
not release any of, and are free to assert any Claim relating to, their rights
and interests under the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the obligations of the Seller Group explicitly set forth in any
provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, or with
respect to any Claim or Damages resulting from such Persons fraud or criminal
act. Each Seller Releasor acknowledges that it has received or has had the
opportunity to receive independent legal advice from its attorneys regarding
this waiver, and each Seller Releasor hereby assumes full responsibility for
any Damages which it may hereunder incur by reason of such waiver.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser
Releasor_ "), on behalf of each Acquired Company and its Affiliates, legal
representatives, successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each of the past and
present officers, managers, directors, employees, counsel and agents of
the Seller Group (each a " _Seller Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and
all Claims which the Purchaser Releasor or its Affiliates, legal
representatives, successors or assigns ever had, now has or may have on or by
reason of any matter, cause or thing

 



51  whatsoever arising out of the Released Matters. The Purchaser Releasor
agrees not to, and agrees to cause the Acquired Companies not to, assert any
Claim against the Seller Releasees with respect to the Released Matters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Releasor and its respective
Affiliates, legal representatives, successors and assigns retain all of, do
not release any of, and are free to assert any Claim relating to, their
rights and interests under the terms of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements, the obligations of the Purchaser explicitly set forth
in any provisions of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, or
with respect to any Claim or Damages resulting from such Persons fraud or
criminal act. The Purchaser Releasor acknowledges that it has received or has
had the opportunity to receive independent legal advice from its attorneys
regarding this waiver, and the Purchaser Releasor hereby assumes full
responsibility for any Damages which it may hereunder incur by reason of such
waiver.

ARTICLE 9 

TAX MATTERS

9.1.  _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes_.

(a) The Seller will indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees against all Excluded
Taxes, other than Taxes that are reflected in the calculation of the Final
Closing Working Capital. Any Purchaser Indemnitee seeking indemnity under this
_Article 9_ will comply with the claims procedure set forth in _Section 8.4_
as modified by this _Article 9_.

(b) The Purchaser will indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against (i) all Taxes
of any Acquired Company that are not an Excluded Tax (other than Taxes which
give rise to an indemnity claim under _Section 8.2_ ), (ii) the Purchasers
share of any Transfer Taxes determined pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , and
(iii) any Taxes resulting from the breach of any covenant or other obligation
of the Purchaser under this Agreement (including this _Article 9_ ). Any
Seller Indemnitee seeking indemnity under this _Article 9_ will comply with
the claims procedure set forth in  _Section 8.4_ as modified by this _Article
9_.

(c) With respect to determining the Taxes for any Straddle Period that
are attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion beginning on the day after the Closing Date, the Parties
agree that Taxes will be allocated based on a closing of the books at the end
of the Closing Date, except that (i) Tax items of a periodic nature or
measured by the level of any item, such as real and personal ad valorem
property Taxes and depreciation allowances calculated on an annual or periodic
basis, will be allocated by apportioning a pro-rata portion of such Taxes to
each day in the relevant Straddle Period and (ii) Tax items resulting from
activities or transactions on the Closing Date, but after the Closing, that
are not in the Ordinary Course or otherwise result from actions described in
_Section 9.5_ will be treated as occurring on the day after the Closing Date.

(d) Any applicable sales, use, transfer, stamp, stock transfer or similar
Taxes that are or become due and payable as a result of the Contemplated
Transactions, whether such Taxes are imposed by Law on the Acquired Companies,
the other Acquired Assets, the Seller Group or the Purchaser (such Taxes, the
" _Transfer Taxes_ "), will be borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by the
Seller and fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser. The

 



52  Parties will cooperate with each other in minimizing the amount of any
Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law (including the
provision of any information or preparation of any documentation that may be
necessary or useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction or
exemption from any such Transfer Taxes). Any Tax Returns that are required to
be filed with respect to any Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the
Party that customarily has primary responsibility for filing such Tax Returns
pursuant to the applicable Law.

(e) All of the Sellers obligations for Taxes under this _Section 9.1_ and
Sellers obligation under _Section 8.2_ to indemnify for Taxes resulting from
a violation of representations under _Section 3.6_ and _Section 3.13_
represent Sellers sole and exclusive obligation for Taxes. Sellers
obligation to indemnify for Taxes under _Section 8.2_ will be subject to the
limitations provided for in _Section 8.5(a)_.

 

9.2. _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refund or credit in lieu of a
refund (including any interest paid or credit with respect thereto) relating
to Excluded Taxes (or is with respect to Taxes paid or accrued by any Acquired
Company on or prior to the Closing Date) or reflected in the calculation of
the Final Closing Working Capital will be the property of the Seller (other
than Tax refunds or credits that relate to the carryback of net operating
losses or other Tax attributes economically generated after the Closing Date),
and if received by the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or one of their
Affiliates, will be paid over promptly to the Seller, net of any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs to the Purchaser (including any Taxes imposed with respect
to the Purchasers receipt of such refund or credit). The Purchaser will, if
the Seller so requests and at the Sellers expense, cause the Acquired
Companies to file for and use its Reasonable Efforts to obtain and expedite
the receipt of any refund to which the Seller is entitled under this _Section
9.2_. The Purchaser will permit the Seller to participate (at the Sellers
expense) in the prosecution of any such refund claim.

9.3. _Cooperation_. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agree that it will
(and will cause its respective Affiliates to):

(a) Provide assistance to the other Party as reasonably requested in
preparing and filing Tax Returns, responding to Tax Contests, and recovering
any Transfer Tax, in each case, relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired
Companies, the other Acquired Assets, or the Business;

 

(b) Make available to the other Party as reasonably requested all information,
Tax Returns (including any pro forma Tax Returns), records and documents
relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Assets and
the Business, except that nothing in this Agreement shall require the Parties
to provide any Tax Returns that include the results of entities other than
the Acquired Companies (e.g., the Sellers U.S. consolidated federal tax
return);

(c) Retain any Tax Returns and other books and records that could reasonably
be expected to be necessary or useful in connection with (i) any preparation
or filing by any other Party of any Tax Returns concerning the Acquired
Companies, the other Acquired Assets or the Business, or (ii) any Tax
Contest or other examination or proceeding

 



53  relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Companies, the other Acquired
Assets or the Business. Such books and records will be retained until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions
thereof); and

(d) Execute any powers of attorney or other documents that will allow an
Indemnifying Party to take control of a Tax Contest as contemplated by
_Section 8.4_.

9.4. _Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies_.

 

(a) The Seller, at its sole cost and expense, will prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies due prior to the Closing Date and all Income Tax Returns of, or with
respect to, any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Period (whether due on,
before, or after the Closing Date) (collectively, " _Seller Prepared Returns_
"). All Seller Prepared Returns will be prepared on a basis consistent with
current practices, procedures, and accounting methods of the Seller and the
Acquired Companies. To the extent an Acquired Company is required to file any
Seller Prepared Returns after the Closing Date, the Seller will submit such
Tax Return to the Purchaser as early as practicable prior to the due date
(after applicable extensions) of such Tax Return for the Purchasers review
and comment, and, to the extent that the Purchaser makes any timely comments,
the Seller will make appropriate changes to the Seller Prepared Return to
reflect the Purchasers reasonable requests. The Purchaser will cause the
applicable Acquired Company to file such Seller Prepared Tax Return as
amended without further change or modification. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Seller shall not be required to submit any information to the Purchaser
with respect to the Seller or any of the Sellers Affiliates that is not also
an Acquired Company including but not limited, to any consolidated, combined
or unitary returns that include companies other than the Acquired Companies.

 

(b) The Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, will prepare and timely file,
or caused to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies (other than Seller Prepared Returns) (collectively, " _Purchaser
Prepared Returns_ "). All Purchaser Prepared Returns, to the extent they
relate to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period will be prepared on a basis
consistent with current practices, procedures, and accounting methods of the
Seller and the Acquired Companies except to the extent required by Law. As
early as practicable prior to the due date (after applicable extensions) of
any Purchaser Prepared Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period, the Purchaser will submit such Tax Return for the Sellers
review and, to the extent that the Seller makes any timely comments, the
Purchaser will, or will cause the applicable Acquired Company to, make
appropriate changes to the Purchaser Prepared Return to reflect the Sellers
reasonable requests.

 

9.5. _Activities After the Closing_. Following the Closing, the Purchaser will
not, and will not allow any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired
Company) to take any of the following actions without the prior written
consent of the Seller: (a) file an amended Tax Return for any Acquired Company
with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period; (b) file for,
or otherwise request from any Governmental Entity, any administrative ruling
(including a private letter ruling or change of method of accounting)
regarding the Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company with respect to a
Pre-Closing Period or Straddle

 



54  Period; (c) make, revoke, or change any material Tax election of any
Acquired Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period; or
(d) agree to extend, waive, or toll any statute of limitations with respect
to the assessment or collection of any Tax of any Acquired Company in a Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period (other than customary automatic extensions
to file Tax Returns obtained in the Ordinary Course).

 

9.6. _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements, Tax allocation
agreements, Tax indemnity obligations, and similar agreements, arrangements,
understandings, and practices with respect to Taxes between any of the
Acquired Companies and the Seller and its Affiliates, and all powers of
attorney with respect to Taxes relating to any of the Acquired Companies will
be cancelled (or appropriately amended) so that no Acquired Company has any
rights or obligations thereunder after the Closing.

9.7.  _Claims Procedure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement generally, or _Section 8.4_ specifically, the Seller shall, at the
sole expense of the Seller, control any Tax Contest related to (i) Excluded
Taxes with respect to the sales or use Taxes and (ii) Tax Returns that
include the Seller or the Sellers Affiliates who are not also Acquired
Companies including, but not limited to, consolidated, combined or unitary tax
returns. To the extent any Tax Contest described in the preceding sentence
includes or otherwise could reasonably be expected to affect one or more of
the Acquired Companies, the Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in such
Tax Contest at the Purchasers expense.

 

9.8. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. At the sole election of the Purchaser, the
Purchaser (or its applicable Affiliate) and the Seller shall jointly make and
file an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding
elections under state or local Law) with respect to the purchase and sale of
LandW and each of its Subsidiaries that is treated as a corporation for Tax
purposes pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ").
The Seller agrees not to take any action that could cause such Section 338
Election to be invalid or ineffective, and shall take no position contrary
thereto, unless required pursuant to a determination (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code or any similar state, local or non-U.S. Law).

 

ARTICLE 10

OTHER AGREEMENTS

10.1. _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, prior to and
following the Closing, each Party agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to
cooperate fully with the other Party and to execute such further instruments,
documents and agreements, and to give such further written assurances, as may
be reasonably requested by any other Party to evidence and reflect the
Contemplated Transactions. In connection therewith, each Party agrees to
comply, and will cause its applicable Affiliates to comply, with its
respective pre-Closing commitments, obligations and covenants under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event (i)
Purchaser or any member of the Seller Group becomes aware after the Closing of
any Acquired Asset that was not assigned to LandW prior to Closing pursuant to
_Section 1.2(a)_ , the applicable member of the Seller Group shall, and

 



55  shall cause any of its applicable Affiliates to, execute and deliver all
instruments and documents reasonably necessary in connection with (A) in the
case of any Acquired Asset owned by the Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies), transferring all right, title, and
interest in and to such Acquired Asset to LandW, or (B) in the case of an
Acquired Asset owned by a Third Party, granting to LandW a license or other
right to use such Acquired Asset (if permitted by the applicable Third Party)
on substantially equivalent terms (including with respect to costs and scope
of use) pursuant to which such Acquired Asset was used by the Business prior
to Closing, or (ii) Purchaser becomes aware after the Closing of an Asset
that was retained by an Acquired Company that is not (x) an Acquired Asset or
(y) an Asset of an Acquired Company related to the Business, then Purchaser
will cause such Asset to be delivered to Seller.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, with reference to the Transition Services
Agreement, each Party agrees that, from the date hereof through the Closing,
it will cooperate fully with the other Party in identifying and agreeing in
good faith upon the Transition Services (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement) and the details thereof to be set forth on Annex A or Annex B
thereto in respect of such Transition Services as reasonably necessary for the
transfer of the Business to the Purchaser. Except as set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement, such Transition Services will be provided for
a period not to exceed 12 months and for consideration as set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement, and will be limited to those services performed
for the Business immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties
will use Reasonable Efforts to finalize Annex A and Annex B to the Transition
Services Agreement within 30 days from the date of this Agreement, but in any
event will use Reasonable Efforts to finalize Annex A and Annex B to the
Transition Services Agreement no later than the Closing.

10.2. _Wrong Pocket_. If after the Closing any member of the Seller Group
receives any payment related to any Acquired Asset which should be paid to
the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Seller agrees to
promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to the Purchaser.
If after the Closing the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) receives any payment that is not related to the Business,
or is otherwise intended to be a payment made to Seller or its Affiliates
(other than an Acquired Company), then Purchaser agrees to promptly remit (or
cause to be promptly remitted) such funds to the Seller. The Parties agree to
treat the ultimate recipient of any such funds as having received the payment
ab initio for all applicable Tax purposes.

 

10.3. _Cooperation; Records and Documents_.

 

(a) If, after the Closing Date, any Party shall reasonably require the
participation of officers or employees then employed by any other Party to
aid in the investigation, defense or prosecution of Legal Proceedings, and so
long as there exists no conflict of interest between the Parties, the Party
receiving the request shall make such officers and employees reasonably
available to participate in such Legal Proceedings. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and anything to the contrary, and consistent with the Sellers
control of the defense of such Specified Legal Proceedings or any of the
matters set forth in _Schedule 8.2(d)_ pursuant to _Section 8.4(d)(v)_ , if,
after the Closing Date, the Seller (i) requires the participation of officers
or employees then employed by the Purchaser or any Acquired

 



56  Company, including the Employees, and/or (ii) requires the provision of any
books and records of the Acquired Companies, whether or not confidential, in
the investigation, defense or prosecution of Specified Legal Proceedings or
any of the matters set forth in _Schedule 8.2(d)_ , the Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies will make such officers and employees, including the
Employees, available to the Seller and its legal counsel and provide such
requested books and records of the Acquired Companies to the Seller. The
Purchaser agrees that the participation and availability of the officers
and/or employees shall include deposition preparation, deposition attendance
and testimony, trial preparation, and trial attendance and testimony.
Additionally, the Purchaser will (A) promptly notify the Seller of any
communications received by a Governmental Entity or any Third Party in
connection with the Specified Legal Proceedings or any of the matters set
forth in _Schedule 8.2(d)_ , (B) provide the Seller an opportunity to review
and comment, and include any comments reasonably requested by the Seller, on
any communications, made by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) to any Governmental Entity or Third Party with respect
to the Specified Legal Proceedings or any of the matters set forth in
_Schedule 8.2(d)_ prior to such communications being made by the Purchaser to
the applicable Governmental Entity or Third Party, and (C) if the Seller is
not controlling the defense as provided in _Section 8.4(d)(v)_ , provide the
Seller and its legal counsel the opportunity to be present at any
depositions, deposition preparation sessions, court hearings, settlement
conferences and any other conferences or meetings (including telephonic)
related to the Specified Legal Proceedings or any of the matters set forth in
_Schedule 8.2(d)_.

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Seller will grant to the Purchaser and its
Representatives, at the Purchasers reasonable request (subject to any
limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege
or Third Party confidentiality obligation), reasonable access during normal
business hours and under reasonable circumstances to, and the right to make
copies of those records and documents in the Sellers possession related to
the Business, the Acquired Companies, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities as may be reasonably necessary for the Purchasers operation of
the Business after the Closing. Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
grant to the Seller and its Representatives, at the Sellers reasonable
request (subject to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve
any applicable privilege or Third Party confidentiality obligation),
reasonable access during normal business hours and under reasonable
circumstances to, and the right to make copies of those records and documents
covering any period prior to the Closing related to the Business, the
Acquired Companies or the Acquired Assets as may be reasonably necessary for
litigation, internal or governmental investigations, preparation of financial
statements or, Tax Returns and Tax audits or other valid business purposes.
If the Purchaser elects to dispose of any of such records within seven years
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will first give the Seller 60 days
written notice, during which period the Seller will have the right to take
such records at its cost and expense. If so requested by either the Seller or
the Purchaser, the other Party will enter into a mutually reasonably
acceptable customary joint defense agreement with the Seller or the Purchaser,
as applicable, with respect to any information to be provided to such Party
pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_. In no event, however, shall anything in
this Agreement be construed to require the Seller Group to provide any Tax
Return that includes information of any member of the Seller Group.

 



57 10.4. RESERVED.

 

10.5. _Confidential Information_. The Parties agree as follows:

 

(a) The Seller agrees that following the Closing Date it will, and will cause
its directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) to, keep the Business Confidential Information,
confidential, except that such information may be disclosed solely to the
extent such disclosure is (i) required by Law or any Governmental Entity
(including the rules and regulations of any stock exchange), or (ii)
necessary to establish rights, or comply with obligations (including in
connection with the defense of indemnified Third Party Claims), under this
Agreement; _provided_ that in any such instance, the Seller will promptly
notify the Purchaser in order to permit the Purchaser to seek a protective
order or take other appropriate action.

 

(b) The Purchaser agrees that following the Closing Date it will, and will
cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) to, keep the Seller Confidential Information
confidential, except that any Seller Confidential Information may be disclosed
solely to the extent such disclosure is (i) required by Law or any
Governmental Entity (including the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange), or (ii) necessary to establish rights, or comply with obligations
(including in connection with the defense of indemnified Third Party Claims)
under this Agreement; _provided_ that in any such instance, the Purchaser
will promptly notify the Seller in order to permit the Seller to seek a
protective order or take other appropriate action.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i)
certain of the Employees may have in their possession, or otherwise have
access to, the Seller Confidential Information, and that despite such
possession or access no Seller Confidential Information constitutes an
Acquired Asset and all such Seller Confidential Information is subject to the
provisions of  _Section 10.5(b)_ and (ii) such Employees are prohibited from
using or disclosing such Seller Confidential Information pursuant to the
Sellers policies and arrangements with former employees. Nothing in this
Agreement limits the obligations of the Employees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Seller Confidential Information or the rights of the
Seller to enforce such policies and arrangements, and the Purchaser agrees to
not seek or require the disclosure of any Seller Confidential Information by
such Employees in breach of such policies and arrangements.

(d) In no event will the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or any Affiliate
or agent of those Persons involved in the operation of the Business advertise
or hold itself out as the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller after the
Closing Date.

 

10.6. _Assignment of Acquired Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except _Section
10.7_ (which governs the Shared Contracts), the Seller Group is under no
obligation to sell, convey, assign, sublease or transfer, or effect a sale,
conveyance, assignment, sublease or transfer, of any Acquired Asset pursuant
to _Section_ _ _ _1.2(a)_ , if the Seller has not obtained a required consent
to assignment or transfer as of the Closing and an attempted assignment or

 



58  transfer thereof without the consent of a Third Party would constitute a
breach or other contravention thereof or a violation of Law, or in any way
affect the rights of the Seller or an Acquired Company with respect to such
Acquired Asset (" _Non-Assignable Assets_ ").

(b) As to any such Non-Assignable Asset, the Purchaser agrees to continue to
use, or cause LandW to use, Reasonable Efforts following the Closing Date to
obtain any consent or waiver required to assign to LandW any Non-Assignable
Asset, and the Seller agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate in
connection with the same, in each case until the earlier of (i) the date that
is six months following the Closing Date or (ii) the current term of such Non-
Assignable Asset. If on the Closing Date, any such consent is not obtained or
an attempted transfer or assignment would be ineffective or a violation of Law
or would impair the rights thereto or thereunder so that LandW would not receive
all such rights, then the Seller and the Purchaser will use, and the Purchaser
will cause LandW to use, Reasonable Efforts to cooperate for six months
following the Closing in any lawful and reasonable arrangement, to the extent
so permitted under the terms of such Non-Assignable Asset and applicable Law,
such that the Purchaser or one of the Acquired Companies obtains the rights
and economic benefits of such Non-Assignable Asset and assumes the economic
burdens and obligations of such Non-Assignable Asset on the same terms as set
forth therein, including by subcontracting, licensing or sublicensing to LandW
of any or all of the Seller Groups rights and obligations with respect to
such Non-Assignable Asset. In any such arrangement, the Purchaser will cause
LandW to (i) bear the sole responsibility for completion of the work or
provision of goods and services, (ii) bear all Taxes with respect thereto or
arising therefrom, (iii) be solely entitled to all benefits thereof, economic
or otherwise, (iv) be solely responsible for any warranty or breach thereof,
any repurchase, indemnity and service obligations thereof and any Damages
related to termination of any Assumed Contracts that are Non-Assignable
Assets, and (v) promptly reimburse the reasonable costs and expenses of the
Seller and its Affiliates related thereto. If and when such consents or
approvals are obtained or such other required actions have been taken, the
transfer of such Non-Assignable Asset to either the Purchaser or an Acquired
Company will be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) No Party will be required to expend money, commence any litigation or
offer any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Third Party to
fulfill its obligation under this _Section 10.6_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement will be deemed to have been
breached as a result of the failure to transfer, or cause to be transferred,
any Non-Assignable Asset to LandW prior to Closing pursuant to _Section
1.2(a)_.

10.7. _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) _Schedule 10.7(a)_ lists those Shared Contracts that are intended to be
split and assigned in part to LandW (the " _Assumed Shared Contracts_ "). The
Seller and the Purchaser shall comply with the provisions of _Section 1.2(a)_
prior to the Closing in an effort to split the respective rights and
obligations under the Assumed Shared Contracts such that, effective at or
prior to the Closing: (i) LandW shall be the beneficiary of the rights and be

 



59  responsible for the obligations and liabilities under the Assumed Shared
Contracts relating to the Business; and (ii) Seller (or its applicable
Affiliate) shall remain the beneficiary of the rights and remain responsible
for the obligations and liabilities of the remainder of the Assumed Shared
Contract. To the extent the consent of a Third Party is required to effect
such split and assignment and such consent is not obtained by the Closing,
such Assumed Shared Contracts will be treated the same as the Non-Assignable
Assets in accordance with _Section 10.6_.

(b)  _Schedule 10.7(b_ ) lists those Shared Contracts that the Seller has
agreed to use Reasonable Efforts, following receipt of notice from Purchaser
pursuant to the second to last sentence of this _Section 10.7(b)_ , to
replicate for the benefit of LandW, effective at or prior to the Closing (the "
_Replicated Contracts_ "). To the extent the consent of a Third Party is
required to effect such replication and such consent is not obtained by the
Closing, the Parties will have no further obligations with respect to such
Replicated Contracts. Purchaser may, at any time prior to 14 calendar days
prior to the Closing Date, deliver a written notice to Seller to request
replication of any items listed on  _Schedule 10.7(b)_ or to remove any item
listed on _Schedule 10.7(b)_. Any item removed from _Schedule 10.7(b)_ will be
deemed added to _Schedule 3.7(b)_.

 

10.8. RESERVED.

10.9. _Use of Certain Marks_. The Purchaser acknowledges that, from and after
the Closing, the Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
will have and retain the absolute and exclusive proprietary right to all of
the Seller Marks. After the Closing, neither the Purchaser, nor any Acquired
Company, will use any Seller Marks or any logos, trademarks or trade names
licensed to the Seller by the International Olympic Committee (unless
Purchaser licenses such rights), including in or on any of the Purchasers or
any Acquired Companys properties, literature, signage, sales materials or
products or otherwise in connection with the marketing, sales and distribution
of any goods or services, except as permitted by (and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of) the Supply Agreement.

10.10. _Closing of Books_. Each Party agrees to consult in good faith and
cooperate with the other Party and its Representatives, including by making
its employees and advisors available to the other Party as reasonably
requested, in the closing of the Seller Groups books and records with
respect to the Business as of the Closing Date in accordance with the Sellers
regular closing schedule and procedures.

 

10.11. _Noncompetition_.

 

(a) During the period from the Closing Date until the four-year anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, within the United States of America, (i) engage in the
Business or (ii) manage, operate, or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any Business Entity or subset of any Business Entity
that is engaged in the Business.

 



60 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, consistent with past practice and any
reasonable extension thereof, the provisions of _Section 10.11(a)_ will not
prohibit the Seller or any of its Affiliates from engaging in the research,
development, manufacture, marketing, delivery direct from factory to end users
at job sites or manufactured housing manufacturing facilities and deliveries
to other distributors, retailers and other resellers at such distributors,
retailers or other resellers place of business or delivery to third parties
providing warehousing services to Seller or its Affiliates, or sales of its
products or any Third Partys products, or the provision of related services,
to end customers, retailers or other distributors, other than through brick-
and-mortar wholesale and retail distribution centers like those operated by
an Acquired Company that are operated by the Seller or its Affiliates (other
than an Acquired Company).

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.11_ will
prohibit or otherwise restrict the Seller or its Affiliates from: 

(i) owning or acquiring an interest in a purely passive and non-controlling
mutual fund or similar common investment vehicle that may own an interest in
any Business Entity that engages in all or a portion of the Business;

(ii) owning or acquiring, for purposes of passive investment, less than 5% of
(A) any class of securities or (B) the value of the Indebtedness of any
Business Entity that engages in all or a portion of the Business; and

 

(iii) acquiring the whole or any part of a Business Entity that does not
primarily engage in the Business, or the whole or any part of a business that
does not primarily engage in operations that compete with the Business;
_provided_ that the Seller or such Affiliate of the Seller will (x) promptly
(and in any event within six months) following the acquisition of
such Business Entity or business, use its Reasonable Efforts to dispose of
the assets representing the portion of such Business Entity or business that
competes with the Business and (y) provide the Purchaser with an opportunity
to bid on the disposition of such assets; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to dispose of any assets of a
Business Entity or business pursuant to this clause (iii) (and shall not be
deemed to be in breach of this  _Section 10.11_ for failing to dispose of any
such assets) if less than 10% of the gross revenue of the Business Entity or
business acquired, as set out in the latest available annual financial
statements of such Business Entity or business (determined on a pro forma
basis as if the disposition of such assets had occurred as of the first day of
the period covered by the latest available annual financial statements),
directly resulted from operations that compete with the Business.

 

(d) The Seller agrees and acknowledges that the potential harm to the Business
and/or the Acquired Companies of the non-enforcement of any provision of this
_Section 10.11_ outweighs any potential harm to the Seller of its enforcement
by injunction or otherwise. The Seller recognizes that the territorial, time
and scope limitations set forth in this _Section 10.11_ are reasonable and
are properly required to protect the Purchasers legitimate interest in client
relationships, goodwill and trade secrets of the Business, and the Acquired
Companies, and that such limitations would not impose any undue burden upon
the Seller. In the event that any such territorial, time or scope limitation
is deemed to be invalid, prohibited

 



61  or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties agree to
the reduction of any or all of said territorial, time or scope limitations to
such an area, period or scope as said court will deem reasonable or
enforceable under the circumstances. The Parties recognize and affirm that, in
the event of a breach by the Seller of any of the provisions of this _Section
10.11_ , money damages would be inadequate and the Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies would not have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies may have the right, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, to enforce
their rights and the Sellers obligations under this _Section 10.11_ by an
action or actions for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable
relief against the Seller to enforce or prevent any violations, whether
anticipatory, continuing or future, of the provisions of this _Section 10.11_.

10.12. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_.

 

(i) Except as provided under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement,
effective as of the Closing, the Employees will cease active participation in
the Seller Plans that are not sponsored or maintained by an Acquired Company
and each of the Acquired Companies shall terminate its participation in each
of the Seller Plans (other than any Multiemployer Plan to which any of the
Acquired Companies is required to contribute under the terms of a Labor
Agreement). Except as expressly required by any Labor Agreement with respect
to any Multiemployer Plan and the requirements of applicable Law, the Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall assume and
retain the sponsorship of and be solely responsible for any and all
Liabilities relating to or at any time arising under or in connection with any
Seller Plan or other Employee Benefit Plan at any time maintained, sponsored
or contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or with respect to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates has
any Liability, other than the Company Plans. The Seller and the "selling
group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-2(a)) of
which it is a part shall be solely responsible for providing continuation
coverage pursuant to Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and similar state Law to those individuals who are "MandA
qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9, QandA-4(b)) whose qualifying event occurs on or prior to
the Effective Time. The Purchaser and the "buying group" (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-2(c)) of which it is a part shall
be solely responsible for providing continuation coverage pursuant to
Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
similar state Law to those individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
whose qualifying event occurs after the Effective Time. The Seller and its
Affiliates shall, under the USG Corporation Investment Plan, make all
employer contributions that would have been made on behalf of the Employees
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred (regardless
of any service or end-of-year employment requirements) but prorated for the
portion of the plan year that ends on the Closing Date.

(ii) Any Employee who, at his or her election, was covered by the MetLife
long-term disability income insurance policy under the USG Selectbenefits

 



62  Program immediately prior to the Closing, will receive any benefits to which
he or she becomes entitled in accordance with the terms of such policy if such
Employee becomes "Disabled" under the terms of the policy as a result of
sickness, disease, pregnancy or accidental injury (or such other relevant
event, injury or illness) that occurs prior to the Closing.

 

(iii) The Purchaser will, or will cause the Acquired Companies to, compensate
each Employee for at least the one-year period beginning on the Closing Date
(or if shorter, the period during which the Employee is employed by the
applicable Acquired Company) as follows:

 

(A) at a base cash compensation level that is no less than the base cash
compensation level provided to the Employee by an Acquired Company, the
Seller or one of its Affiliates, as applicable, immediately prior to the
Closing Date; provided, however, that for Employees who are represented for
purposes of collective bargaining by a labor organization under a
Labor Agreement (" _Represented Employees_ "), the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, provide wages and other compensation in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Labor Agreements or
their economic equivalent;

(B) with respect to the 2016 performance period, with the same level of target
incentive pay or other additional cash compensation opportunities as provided
under the Company Plans that are listed on _Schedule 10.12(a)(iii)(B)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule for which the Employee was eligible immediately
prior to the Closing Date; and

 

(C) with employee benefits that are substantially comparable to those
currently offered under the Employee Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule
10.12(a)(iii)(C)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any
Represented Employees, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, provide benefits in accordance with the terms of any applicable
Labor Agreements in effect at the relevant time or their economic equivalent,
including, where applicable, continuing participation in, and remitting
contribution to, multi-employer pension and welfare plans.

 

(b) _Severance_. Without limiting _Section 10.12(a)_ , if the employment of
any Employee is terminated by the Purchaser or an Acquired Company within one
year after the Closing Date as a result of an office or branch shut down or
closure or business reorganization causing position eliminations, the
Purchaser will provide (or cause an Acquired Company to provide)
such Employee with the amounts due under any Contract between such Employee
and the applicable Acquired Company, or, if no such Contract exists, with the
severance payments and benefits that would have been provided to such Employee
under the Seller Plan that provides separation benefits for salaried, hourly
and management employees as set forth on _Schedule 10.12(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or applicable Labor Agreement immediately prior to the
Closing Date, based on the Employees years of credited service under such
Seller Plan. During the one-year period beginning on the Closing Date, a

 



63  transfer of an Employees primary workplace by the Purchaser or one of the
Acquired Companies to a location more than 50 miles from the Employees
primary workplace immediately prior to the Closing Date (A) if accepted, will
entitle such Employee to relocation benefits from the Purchaser or the
applicable Acquired Company at least equal to the relocation benefits
available to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates under the Purchaser Plan that is a relocation policy or (B) if
refused (resulting in the termination of the Employees employment with the
applicable Acquired Company), will entitle the Employee to the
severance allowance and benefits provided under this _Section 10.12(b)_.

(c) _Service Credit_. The Purchaser will, or will cause the Acquired
Companies to, provide each Employee with full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and, only with respect to any vacation plan or policy,
level of benefits, under the Purchaser Plans, other than any equity or equity-
based compensation or benefits, for pre-Closing Date service with any
Acquired Company, the Seller and its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, any of their Controlled Group Members) to the same extent as such
service was credited under the comparable Seller Plans for the same purpose
immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event will the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies be required to provide any
service credit to any Employee to the extent the provision of such credit
would result in any duplication of benefits or compensation.

(d) _Union Employees_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in any
of the other Transaction Agreements, the terms and conditions of employment of
the Employees who are covered by a Labor Agreement shall be as set out in the
applicable Labor Agreement (and the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies may
offer compensation and employee benefits that are the economic equivalent to
those provided for in such Labor Agreements) until such applicable Labor
Agreements expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its
terms or applicable Law.

(e) _No Solicitation_. The Seller agrees that for a period of 12 months after
the Closing Date, except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, or
through any of their respective Representatives, solicit to hire or hire any
Employee while such Employee is employed by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date); provided
that the Seller will not be restricted in any general solicitation for
employees not specifically directed at any Employee. The Purchaser agrees
that for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date, except with the prior
written consent of the Seller, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) will, directly or indirectly, or through
any of their respective Representatives, solicit to hire or hire any employee
of the Seller or any of its Affiliates while such employee is employed by the
Seller or any of its Affiliates; provided that the Purchaser will not be
restricted in any general solicitation for employees not specifically directed
at employees of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies).

 

(f) _Employee Communications_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
not communicate with any Employees without the consent of the Seller.
However, the Parties will cooperate with respect to any employee
communications regarding any matters

 



64  provided for herein. The Parties further agree to coordinate in advance any
formal meetings or presentations between Employees and the Purchasers
Representatives and any Purchaser written employee communications to the
extent that such formal meetings, presentations or written employee
communications are scheduled to occur or to be distributed, as applicable,
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(g) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 10.12_ will not confer Third-
Party beneficiary rights upon any Person, including any Employee, other than
the parties to this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 10.12_ will be
construed as giving to any Employee or any other Person (other than the
parties to this Agreement) any legal or equitable right against the Seller or
the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 10.12_ will
constitute a contract of employment (or guarantee any particular term or
condition of employment) or will give any Employee or other Person a right
to be employed by or retained in the employ of an Acquired Company, the
Seller or the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, unless the Employee would
otherwise have that right under applicable Law, and nothing shall limit the
ability of the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates
to terminate the employment of any employee (including any Employee) at any
time and for any or no reason. Nothing in this _Section 10.12_ shall be
construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies) to
amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan and nothing in this
_Section 10.12_ shall be construed as an amendment to any such Employee
Benefit Plan for any purpose.

(h) _Pre-Closing Employee Transfer_. Concurrently with the Pre-Closing
Transfer, Seller shall transfer any Employees on _Schedule A-6_ that are on
the payroll of Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired
Company) to LandWs payroll in a manner consistent with historical moves of
employees from Seller and its Affiliates to LandW. Following the Closing, for
calendar year 2016, the Seller shall treat the employment of such Employees
with the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) as
employment with the Seller for all purposes under the Year 2016 Annual Profit
Achievement Incentive Program, USG Corporation and the Year 2016 Annual
Management Incentive Program, USG Corporation. The Purchaser shall notify the
Seller if any such Employees employment terminates for any reason during
calendar year 2016.

10.13. _Access to Seller Insurance_.

 

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges that (i) from and after the Effective Time, the
Acquired Companies will be removed from coverage under, and will cease to be
insured for occurrences arising after the Effective Time under any of the
Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies (or any self-insurance programs
of the Seller and its Affiliates) that afforded coverage to the Seller or its
Affiliates or to any of the Acquired Companies (" _Historical Insurance
Policies_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser only has rights under
the Third Party Insurance Policies as set forth in _Section 10.13(b)_. The
Purchaser will be responsible for obtaining any and all insurance coverage for
itself and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) after the
Effective Time.

 



65 (b) At any time after the Closing Date, upon the written request of the
Purchaser, the Seller will use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies to investigate and pursue claims or
potential claims with respect to acts, facts, circumstances or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date under Historical Insurance Policies that
are issued by a Third Party (but not any self-insurance programs of the Seller
or its Affiliates) (" _Third Party Policies_ "). The Purchaser shall provide
Seller with advance notice of such claims or potential claims, and will bear
all deductibles and retentions, and any other reasonable expenses, incurred by
the Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with such claims or
potential claims, but neither the Purchaser nor any Acquired Company will be
obligated to reimburse the Seller for any increase in insurance premiums
imposed on the Seller that can reasonably be attributed to the pursuit of
claims or potential claims by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) under the Third Party Policies in accordance with this
_Section_ _ _ _10.13_.

(c) The Seller will retain all rights to control any Historical Insurance
Policies, including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back
or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any Historical Insurance
Policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller will not, and will cause
its Affiliates not to, settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any Third Party Policies to the extent that such
action will or would reasonably be expected to reduce the limits of coverage
provided to the Acquired Companies under such Third Party Policies without the
written consent of Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser
and Acquired Companies will not settle, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any Third Party Policies to the
extent that such action will or would reasonably be expected to reduce the
limits of coverage provided to the Seller under such Third Party Policies
without the written consent of Seller (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in thi _s Section_ _ _ _10.13_ to the contrary,
thi _s Section_ _ _ _10.13_ is subject in all respects to the terms of the
Third Party Policies, and to the extent such Third Party Policies do not
permit any of the acts described in thi _s Section_ _ _ _10.13_ , then neither
the Seller nor any of its Affiliates will have any obligation or liability to
the Purchaser or the Acquired Companies with respect to such acts.

10.14. _Licenses_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller hereby grants to the
Purchaser a fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual,
non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable license (except in
connection with the sale of the Business) to the items set forth on _Schedule
10.14(a)_ in connection with the operation of the Business.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser hereby grants to Seller a
fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-
exclusive, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable license to use the Trademark
"All Interior Supply" in connection with the dissolution of All Interior
Supply, LLC.

 



66 10.15. _Privileged Communications_.

 

(a) The Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, on behalf of the Acquired Companies), that
all communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among Jones
Day and/or any other legal counsel to any of the Acquired Companies
(including, in-house legal counsel) (each a " _Counsel_ "), on the one hand,
and any Acquired Company or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or other representatives, on the other hand, prior to the Closing
that relate in any way to the preparation for or negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or any dispute arising
under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ ") shall
be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and property of the Seller and that
the Privileged Communications and the expectation of client confidence
relating thereto belong solely to the Seller and may be controlled by the
Seller, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser or any of the
Acquired Companies. Accordingly, the Purchaser will not have access to any
such Privileged Communications or to the files of Jones Day relating to the
same, regardless of whether the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that after the Closing a dispute arises between the Purchaser
or any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and a Third Party other than a
Party to this Agreement, on the other hand, the applicable Acquired Company
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of Privileged
Communications to such Third Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Purchaser nor any Acquired Company may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

(b) The Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Acquired Companies) acknowledges and agrees that Jones Day
has acted as counsel for the Seller and its Affiliates and that the Seller
reasonably anticipates that Jones Day may continue to represent the Seller
and/or its Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, the Purchaser, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) expressly (i) consents to Jones Days representation of the Seller
and its Affiliates and any of their respective agents (if any of the foregoing
Persons so desire) in any matter, including any post-Closing matter in which
the interests of the Purchaser and the Acquired Companies, on the one hand,
and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse,
including any matter relating to the Contemplated Transactions, and whether
or not such matter is one in which Jones Day may have previously advised the
Seller, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates and (ii)
consents to the arrangements in this _Section 10.15_  and waives any actual
or potential conflict of interest that may be involved in connection with any
representation by Jones Day permitted hereunder.

 

10.16. _Acquired Company Insurance_. If, after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) become aware of any
Liability for which it has a claim for indemnification under _Schedule 8.2(d)_
(" _Specified Claims_ "), the Purchaser will, and will cause its Affiliates
to, (i) provide Seller notice of such Specified Claim within a reasonable
time, (ii) to the extent the Acquired Companies have information sufficient to
give notice, provide notice within the time period required by the applicable
insurance policies (or if such information is not available, within
a reasonable time) to insurers who provide coverage for such Specified Claim
under any applicable insurance policies available

 



67  to the Acquired Companies and listed on _Schedule 10.16_ (and any other
applicable insurance policies identified pursuant to the following sentence),
(iii) use Reasonable Efforts to pursue all rights and remedies in connection
with, and obtain the benefits under, any such insurance policies, including,
litigation and/or arbitration to final adjudication with no right of appeal,
in respect of any and all such insurance policies, and (iv) provide the
Seller with copies of all material correspondence and pleadings and other
communications in connection with such Specified Claim. Purchaser will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Seller to investigate and
pursue coverage for any such Specified Claim from all such insurance policies,
and cooperate with the Seller to identify and locate any and all potentially
available insurance policies that may provide coverage for such Specified
Claim, including by providing historical information and documents, and
retaining third parties to assist in identifying and pursuing such insurance
coverage (provided that the Seller shall, in all circumstances, bear all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with any such activities, as well as all
other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Purchaser and its
Affiliates including the Acquired Companies in fulfilling their respective
obligations in this _Section 10.16_ ). The Purchaser will maintain all
applicable insurance coverage in effect as of the Closing Date relating to
pending or potential Specified Claims. In the event of a failure of the
Purchaser to fulfill the requirements of this _Section 10.16_ , such failure
will relieve Seller of its indemnity obligations with respect to the Specified
Claims affected, but only to the extent of any prejudice arising from such
failure.

 

ARTICLE 11

 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1.  _Governing Law; Forum_.

(a) The Laws of the State of Delaware (without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law) will govern the construction, interpretation and other
matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and its exhibits,
annexes and schedules (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise).

 

(b) The Parties agree to try to resolve in a friendly manner all disagreements
and misunderstandings connected with their respective rights and obligations
under this Agreement or any agreement or document delivered pursuant hereto or
the Transaction Agreements, including any amendments hereof and thereof.
Except with respect to matters for which an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief is sought pursuant to _Section 11.13_ ,
to the extent that any misunderstanding, dispute, controversy or Claim (a "
_Dispute_ ") arising out of or relating to the Contemplated Transactions or
the validity, interpretation, breach or termination of any such agreement
cannot be resolved agreeably in a friendly manner either the Purchaser or the
Seller may by written notice to the other Party (the " _Initial Notice_ ")
call for the consideration of such dispute by a high level management
employee, which will be the Chief Executive Officer of the Seller and Chief
Executive Officer of the Purchaser, or an equivalent position, as the case may
be, to discuss and attempt to resolve the Dispute. Such Persons may be
assisted by other advisors, including accountants, attorneys and employees, in
his or her discussions and negotiations with the other Party. The Purchaser
and the Seller agree to negotiate in good faith with one another for an
additional period ending 20 days after the date of the Initial Notice. Any
Dispute that the Parties cannot

 



68  resolve through negotiation within such 20-day period may then be submitted
to the courts for resolution pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_. Nothing in this
_Section 11.1(b)_ modifies, or relieves any Party from compliance with, any
of the other time periods or time limitations set forth in this Agreement.
Nothing in this _Section 11.1(b)_ will prevent either Party from resorting to
judicial proceedings if relief from a court is believed to be necessary to
prevent serious and irreparable injury to one Party or to others.

(c) All offers of compromise or settlement among the Parties or their
Representatives in connection with the attempted resolution of any Dispute
will be deemed confidential settlement communications that have been delivered
in furtherance of a Dispute settlement and will be exempt from discovery and
production and will not be admissible in evidence (whether as an admission or
otherwise) in any proceeding for the resolution of the Dispute.

 

(d) Except with respect to Disputes arising out of a Third Party Claim for
which an Indemnifying Party has obligations to provide indemnification

the courts hearing the applicable Third Party Claim), the Parties irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware
and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of
Delaware over any Dispute arising out of or relating to the Transaction
Agreements or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby or entered into
in connection herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement,
each of the Parties and their Affiliates agrees that it will not bring or
support any legal action or judicial proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
involving the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including but not limited
to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter, the other Debt Financing Documents or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York in the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). Each
Party hereby irrevocably agrees that all Claims in respect of such Dispute or
proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and the courts hearing
appeals from such courts). The Parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection therewith. TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES
ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATED TO THE
DEBT FINANCING OR TO WHICH ANY FINANCING SOURCE IS A PARTY) OR THE ACTION OF
ANY OF THE PARTIES THERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

 



69 11.2. _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement binds and benefits the
Parties and their respective successors and assignees, except that the
Purchaser will not assign any of its rights under this Agreement prior to the
Closing without the prior written consent of the Seller. In addition, no Party
may delegate any performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except
that the Purchaser may at any time assign, delegate or transfer in whole or in
part the performance of its obligations (other than the obligation to pay the
Closing Purchase Price) to any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the
Purchaser (i) remains fully responsible for the performance of the delegated
obligations by executing such documents or instruments as the Seller may
reasonably request and (ii) such Affiliate executes a written agreement of
assumption of such obligations in a form reasonably acceptable to the Seller.

11.3. _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. This Agreement is not intended to
and will not be construed to give any Person other than the Parties any
interest or rights (including any Third Party beneficiary rights) with respect
to or in connection with this Agreement or provision contained herein or
contemplated hereby, except, solely with respect to each Financing Source,
_Section 7.3_ , _Section 11.1(a)_ , _Section 11.1(d)_ , this _Section 11.3_ ,
_Section 11.8_ , _Section 11.9_ and  _Section 11.16_.

11.4. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement remain in full force, if the essential terms and conditions
of this Agreement for each Party remain valid, binding and enforceable. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Contemplated Transactions
are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

11.5. _Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions_. This Agreement, together
with the other Transaction Agreements and all of the exhibits, annexes and
schedules attached hereto and thereto, constitute the final, complete and
exclusive statement of the Parties agreement on the matters contained herein
and therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of _Section 11.1_
will not apply to the Supply Agreement. All prior and contemporaneous
negotiations and agreements between the Parties on the matters contained in
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements are superseded by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including, but subject to
_Section_ _ _ _5.5(b)_ hereof, the NDA.

 

11.6. _Counterparts_. The Parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the Party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each Party to the
other Party. The signatures of all parties need not appear on the same
counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or email
transmission that includes a copy of the sending Partys signature(s) is as
effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

 

11.7. _Expenses_. Except to the extent specified otherwise in this Agreement,
each Party will pay its own costs, professional fees and other expenses
(including all legal,

 



70  accounting, broker, lender or investment banking) incurred by it in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ that if any Party
institutes any Legal Proceeding against the other Party arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such Legal Proceeding
shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all other Damages to which it may
be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs
incurred by the prevailing party.

11.8. _Amendment_. The Parties may amend this Agreement only by a
written agreement signed by the Parties and that identifies itself as an
amendment to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no modification or
amendment to this Agreement shall be made that would adversely affect the
rights of the Financing Sources as set forth in _Section 7.3_ , _Section
11.1(a)_ , _Section 11.1(d)_ , _Section 11.3_ , this _Section 11.8_ , _Section
11.9_ and _Section 11.16_ without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

 

11.9. _Waiver_. The Parties may waive a provision of this Agreement only by a
writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no modification or amendment to this Agreement
shall be made that would adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources
as set forth in _Section 7.3_ , _Section 11.1(a)_ ,  _Section 11.1(d)_ ,
_Section 11.3_ , _Section 11.8_ , this _Section 11.9_ and _Section 11.16_
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources. A Party is not
prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the Partys favor
because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy or in
requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent that the Party
specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given for one
matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose
stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for any other
matter or occasion.

 

11.10. _Notices_. Each Party giving any notice required or permitted under
this Agreement will give the notice in writing, and will be deemed to have
been duly given: (a) when received if delivered personally; (b) when
transmitted if sent by facsimile or telecopy (with transmission confirmed);
(c) the day after it is sent if sent by commercial overnight courier (with
receipt confirmed); (d) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail
(return receipt requested); or (e) when transmitted if sent by email (with
receipt confirmed by recipient). Notice to a Party is effective for purposes
of this Agreement only if given as provided in this _Section_ _ _ _11.10_ at

if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if the Parties do
not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Therefore, notwithstanding anything in _Section 11.1_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
Party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order or
injunction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 11.13(a)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed that, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, the Seller shall be entitled to enforce
specifically or seek an injunction to enforce the obligations of the Purchaser
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions only in the event that, on or
after October 31, 2016, (i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or waived in writing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (other than (A) conditions that
cannot be satisfied until the Closing has actually occurred, provided that
such conditions are capable of being satisfied at the Closing, or (B)
conditions that have not been satisfied due to any breach of this Agreement by
the Purchaser), (ii) either (x) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing, or (y) the Debt Financing is not funded and such
failure of the Debt Financing to be funded is due (in whole or in part) to the
(1) failure of the Purchaser to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any Debt Financing Document (which term shall be deemed to
include the Debt Financing Fee Letter) or (2) existence of any "Event of
Default" under (and as defined in) the Credit Agreement (including as a
result of any cross-default or similar default) (collectively, a " _Credit
Agreement Default_ ") or, in each case, because any such event would result
from the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (each such event or
occurrence, a " _Financing Event_ "), and (iii) the Seller has confirmed in
writing to the Purchaser that all conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ have
been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied at the Closing or waived,
and the Seller is prepared to consummate the Closing

 



74  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including _Section 2.2_ , if
specific performance is granted. Further, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed that, in the event that
(1) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.3_ have been satisfied or waived in writing in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (other than (A) conditions that cannot be satisfied until the
Closing has actually occurred, provided that such conditions are capable of
being satisfied at the Closing, or (B) conditions that have not been satisfied
due to any breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser), (2) the Purchaser has
not consummated the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ by the Termination Date
solely as a result of the Debt Financing failing to be funded and such failure
of the Debt Financing to be funded is not due (in whole or in part) to the
failure of the Purchaser to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any Debt Financing Document or due to any Financing Event, and
(3) other than failing to consummate the Closing as described in clause (2),
the Purchaser has not breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement, then (A) no
Seller Related Party shall be entitled to any specific performance, injunctive
relief or other equitable relief or enforcement of the obligations of the
Purchaser to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and (B) except for the
rights of the Parties under the NDA and any amounts due under _Section 7.3(c)_
, _Section 11.7_ and/or the last two sentences of _Section 5.11(d)_ , the
right of the Seller to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Damages suffered or
incurred by the Seller Related Parties in connection with this Agreement or
any other Transaction Agreement (and the termination hereof or thereof), the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Contemplated Transactions (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination. 

(c) Prior to the termination of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, under no circumstances will Seller, or any of
its Affiliates or any other Person be entitled in respect of any single
action, non-action, matter or event to both a grant of specific performance or
other equitable remedies of the sort described in this _Section 11.13_  and
any monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Termination Fee;
provided that such Person shall be entitled to pursue an injunction or
specific performance pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The election of
the Seller to pursue an injunction or specific performance (regardless of
whether such injunction or specific performance is granted) shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Seller from subsequently seeking
payment of the Termination Fee (to the extent entitled thereto) pursuant to
_Section 7.3_ , and the fact that the Seller is entitled to receive the
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3_ shall not limit the Sellers
right to pursue an injunction or specific performance (subject to the terms
of this _Section 11.13(c)_ ); _provided_ that the Sellers acceptance of the
Termination Fee shall terminate any right to injunctive relief or specific
performance hereunder or other equitable remedies (other than rights under
the NDA).

11.14. _Payments_. Except with respect to payments to be made in connection
with the Closing (including Purchasers payment of the Closing Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_ ), the Parties will pay all amounts due and owing
under this Agreement no later than five Business Days after the date such
amounts become owed. All late payments will bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to 6%.

 



75 11.15. _Rep_ _ _ _and Warranty Insurance_. Nothing in this Agreement shall in
any way limit the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnitee or any of their
respective Affiliates from making any Claims or receiving any recoveries under
the transaction representation and warranties insurance policy obtained by the
Purchaser (the " _Rep and Warranty Policy_"), whether for breaches under this
Agreement or any other Claim that may be permitted to be made under the Rep and
Warranty Policy. The Purchaser shall cause the Rep and Warranty Policy
to include a waiver of subrogation rights against the Seller and/or any of
the Sellers Affiliates and/or any of their respective equityholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or representatives, except to
the extent that the Seller, the Acquired Companies, and/or any of the
Sellers respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or
representatives has committed a deliberately fraudulent act or statement
causing Damages, which waiver of subrogation rights shall not be amended
without the Sellers prior written consent.

11.16. _No-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (a) none of the Seller Related Parties nor any of their
respective subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (b) no Financing Source shall have any liability to any Seller
Related Party or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders for
any obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise.
