the result of Sellers failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consents by such date.    

 (b) Seller and its Affiliates shall assign to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume from Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable, each and every Included Standalone Customer Contract (i) upon Buyers request following the transition of certain customer billing functions in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement, with respect to any Included Standalone Customer Contract other than Consent Required Contracts; or (ii) as of the later of the first business day after Seller receives all applicable Third Party Consents and Buyers request following the transition of the customer billing functions in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement, with respect to any Consent Required Contract.

On the date that an Included Standalone Customer Contract is assigned to and assumed by Buyer, it shall be and become an " _Assumed Customer Contract_ " and prior to that time it shall be referred to as a " _Provisional Customer Contract_ ". Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer agree that Buyer and its Affiliates are not assuming and will not assume any liabilities or obligations arising or accruing under an Included Standalone Customer Contract prior to such Included Standalone Customer Contract becoming an Assumed Customer Contract; it being understood that Buyer shall perform the conferencing services under such contracts, as a subcontractor of Seller, in accordance with  _Section 2.5(e)_. Prior to the assignment of a Provisional Customer Contract, Seller shall provide Buyer with a complete and correct copy of such contract if a written contract exists and, with respect to agreements and arrangements other than written contracts, shall provide Buyer with a description of any terms relating to the provision of the applicable Conferencing Services in Sellers possession.

" _Separate Agreement and Release_ "). Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer and
its Affiliates are not assuming and will not assume any liabilities or
obligations arising or accruing under a Bundled Customer Contract; it being
understood that Buyer shall perform the Conferencing Services under such
contract in accordance with _Section 2.5(e)_ and that Buyer shall only
be responsible for any liabilities or obligations to which it agrees in the
Separate Agreement and Release. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller will not
be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 2.5(c)_ by reason of failure to
obtain a Separate Agreement and Release for each Bundled Customer Contract on
or prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date except to the
extent such failure was the result of Sellers failure to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Separate Agreement and Release by such
date.    

 (d) Seller and its Affiliates shall exercise or exploit their rights and options under the Provisional Customer Contracts only as reasonably directed by Buyer. Seller and its Affiliates may exercise their rights and perform their obligations under the Bundled Customer Contracts in their sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and its Affiliates shall exercise or exploit any right or option under such contracts dealing exclusively with Conferencing Services only as reasonably directed by Buyer (it being understood that Seller shall not amend or waive any portion of a Bundled Customer Contract in a manner that affects the term, pricing (including customer credits) or service level commitments for Conferencing Services without Buyers consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld). In accordance with _Section 2.1(e)_, Seller shall pay to Buyer (subject to _Section 3.2_) amounts equal to all Collectible Revenue billed by Seller with respect to Conferencing Services provided after the Closing Date, so as to provide the economic effect as if all Provisional Customer Contracts and the portions of Bundled Customer Contracts relating to the Business had been assigned to Buyer on the Closing Date. Seller shall make such payments of Collectible Revenue billed during each month no later than the 30th day of the immediately following month. This _Section 2.5(d)_ shall continue to apply to each Provisional Customer Contract until the contract becomes an Assumed Customer Contract or is terminated or expires and to each Bundled Customer Contract until the execution and delivery of a Separate Agreement and Release or the contract is terminated or expires.

 (a) Seller is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Seller is duly qualified to transact business as a limited partnership and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which such qualification is required in connection with Sellers ownership or leasing of the Purchased Assets or its conduct of the Business.

 (b) All of the ownership interests of Seller are owned, directly or indirectly, 100% by Sprint of record and beneficially.

 5.3. _Authority of Seller_.   

 (a) Seller and Sprint have full power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and, in the case of Seller, all of the Seller Ancillary Agreements. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and, in the case of Seller, the Seller Ancillary Agreements by Seller and Sprint have been duly authorized and approved by Sellers general partner or other authorized person and do not require any further authorization or consent of Seller, its partners or any Affiliates or Sprint, its stockholders or any Affiliates. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Seller and Sprint and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller and Sprint enforceable in accordance with its terms, and each of the Seller Ancillary Agreements has been duly authorized by Seller and upon execution and delivery by Seller will be a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms.   

 (b) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.3(b)_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or, in the case of Seller, any of the Seller Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance with or fulfillment of the terms, conditions and provisions hereof or thereof will:    

 (i) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the Purchased Assets; or    

 (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of rights under (A) the certificate of limited partnership, limited partnership agreement or other organizational document of Seller or the charter or by-laws of Sprint, (B) any Seller Agreement, (C) any other material note, instrument, agreement, mortgage, lease, license, franchise, permit or other authorization, right, restriction or obligation to which Seller or Sprint is a party or any of the Purchased Assets is subject or by which Seller or Sprint is bound (other than Included Customer Contracts), (D) any Court Order to which Seller or Sprint is a party or any of the Purchased Assets is subject or by which Seller or Sprint is bound, or (E) any Requirements of Laws affecting Seller, Sprint, the Purchased Assets or the Business; or    ##### 

  

   

 (iii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of, or the making by Seller or Sprint of any declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Body (including, without limitation, any approval, consent, or authorization by any regulatory body with respect to any customer transfers), except as _provided_  under the HSR Act.   

 (c) Seller has not received a second request or other notification from the FTC or the Antitrust Division with respect to the notifications and other information filed by it under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. All such filings by Seller were, as of the date filed, true and accurate and in accordance with the requirements of the HSR Act.   

 (d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.3(d)_, with respect to the Included Customer Contracts for Payment Eligible Customers only, the provision of Conferencing Services by Buyer under such contracts as contemplated by _Section 2.5_ will not conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights of acceleration, termination or cancellation or a loss of rights under any such contract.

sign and deliver, any Tax Return required to be filed that is attributable to
the sale or transfer of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities and any certificates or forms as may be necessary or appropriate
to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) such Taxes.    

 (c) Seller shall timely file all property Tax Returns relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets with respect to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall timely file all property Tax Returns relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets with respect to periods beginning after the Closing Date. With respect to property Taxes relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets imposed with respect to a Straddle Period, Seller shall timely file property Tax Returns relating to such Taxes to the extent the due date for such property Tax Returns is on or prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer shall timely file property Tax Returns relating to such Taxes to the extent the due date for such property Tax Returns is after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ that, in any case where the due date for such property Tax Return is within 30 days following the Closing Date, Seller shall file such property Tax Return unless and to the extent Buyer agrees in writing to do so. With respect to any Tax Returns relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets that are not described herein, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other to determine the party that shall prepare and file any such Tax Return.    

 (d) Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall provide reimbursement for any Tax paid by one party all or a portion of which is the responsibility of the other party in accordance with the terms of this _Section 8.2_. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any said Tax, the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party of the Tax payable and the portion which is the liability of each party, although failure to do so will not relieve the other party from its liability hereunder.    

 (e) After the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) assist and cooperate with each other in order to facilitate the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, including without limitation making available to the other party relevant information, records and documents (including copies thereof) required in the preparation of such Tax Returns.    

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section 8.2_ shall be (i) subject to the Sales and Marketing Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect without limitation as to time.    

 8.3. _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) Effective immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall make an offer of employment to each of the employees of Seller listed on  _Schedule 8.3_ (the " _Transferring Employees_ "), which offer shall be conditioned upon,     ##### 

  

     

among other things, the execution of any agreements which Buyer requires of
new employees as a condition of employment, including any confidentiality,
non-competition, non-solicitation, intellectual property or other similar
agreement. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
of the Transferring Employees to become employees of Buyer on the
Closing Date. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and
vesting under any employee benefit plan of Buyer, Transferring Employees who
(i) become employees of Buyer and actually perform services for Buyer on the
Closing Date or (ii) are on an approved paid leave of absence with Seller as
of the Closing Date but commence active employment with Buyer or one of
its Affiliates within twenty-six (26) weeks after the Closing Date shall
receive service credit for service with Seller to the same extent such credit
was granted under Sellers comparable employee benefit plans. Notwithstanding
anything set forth herein to the contrary, (i) nothing in this Agreement
shall create any obligation on the part of Buyer to continue the employment of
any employee for any period following the Closing Date and (ii) nothing in
this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from altering, amending or terminating
any of its employee benefit plans, or the participation of any of its
employees in such plans, at any time.    

 (b) To the extent permitted therein, all Transferring Employees who are eligible to participate in Buyers employee benefit plans as of the Closing Date, taking into account any service credited pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, shall commence such participation on the first day of the calendar month immediately following the Closing Date. Seller will continue the following health and welfare plan coverage through the last day of the calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs: Medical, Dental, Prescription Drug, Vision, Health Care Reimbursement Account, Dependent Day Care Reimbursement Account, Employee Life, Dependent Life, and ADandD. Coverage under the Short Term Disability, Basic and Supplemental Long Term Disability plans will terminate on the employees last day of active employment with Seller. To the extent permitted by Buyers medical plans, each Transferring Employee shall receive credit under such plans for all amounts paid during the current calendar year under Sellers medical plans toward applicable deductible amounts and out-of-pocket maximums, _provided_ that Buyer receives from the Transferring Employee all data required by Buyer as evidence of such paid amounts.    

 (c) With respect to each Transferring Employee, Seller shall retain the obligation and liability for any workers compensation or similar workers protection claims with respect to any such individual, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date which are the result of an injury or illness originating prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall retain, pay, perform and discharge, and Buyer shall not assume or be obligated to pay, perform or discharge, any liability or obligation under any employee benefit plan of either Seller or its Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall honor all commitments made by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Transferring Employees with respect to (i) tuition assistance for any semester that has begun prior to the Closing Date ( _provided_ that the Transferring Employees meet the Educational Assistance Program guidelines, including without limitation submission dates and grades), and (ii) adoption assistance applied for prior to the Closing Date ( _provided_ that the Transferring Employees meet the Adoption Assistance Program Guidelines, including without limitation the requirement that the child be placed in the Transferring Employees home prior to the Closing Date).     ##### 

  

     

 (d) Subject to requirements of applicable law, Seller shall provide Buyer the most recent annual performance review and performance rating for each Transferring Employee, and available records related to any active FMLA leave request, including each Transferring Employees FMLA eligibility and hours available for use.    

 (e) Buyer shall have no liabilities: (i) related to the employees of Seller who do not become Transferring Employees; (ii) related to Transferring Employees to the extent such liability arises from any action, event or course of conduct prior to the date such Transferring Employee is hired by Buyer; or (iii) to the extent such liability arises under or relates to any Seller Plan.    

 (f) Buyer shall not have responsibility for any severance or termination pay obligations and damages for wrongful dismissal, including, without limitation, obligations arising under the common law, incurred with respect to any period of employment prior to the Closing Date or with respect to any termination of employment by or with Seller. Seller shall be solely responsible for any fees or other obligations under any agreement between Seller and any temporary employment agency. Buyer shall be solely responsible for entering into a separate contract with any temporary employment agency if Buyer determines that such contract services are desirable after the Closing.    

 (g) Seller shall be responsible for satisfying the "continuation coverage" requirements under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and any applicable comparable state law (" _COBRA Coverage_ ") with respect to each Transferring Employee, each employee of Seller who does not become a Transferring Employee (and any dependent) and each former employee of Seller (and any dependent) who is entitled to COBRA Coverage.    

 (h) Seller shall pay or cause to be paid from funds provided by it to each Transferring Employee, not later than the next regular payroll date following the Closing Date, any salary or wages which shall have accrued as of the Closing Date with respect to such employee. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid from funds provided by it to each Transferring Employee any bonus compensation accrued as of the Closing Date to which such employee may be entitled as a result of his or her participation in a bonus plan of Seller or its Affiliates, in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan (except that it shall not be a condition to such payment, or the accrual of the amount payable, that such employee remain an employee of Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing Date) and in the time frame normally called for by such plan.    

 (i) Seller shall comply with all notice and other requirements under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") and any regulations promulgated thereunder, and any similar laws with respect to actions taken by Seller or its Affiliates on or prior to the Closing Date. In the event that, prior to the Closing Date, there is any employee employed by Seller with respect to the Business whose employment is terminated, whose work hours are reduced, who is laid off or who otherwise experiences an "employment loss," within the meaning of the WARN Act (each, an " _Affected Employee_ "), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (i) each Affected Employees name, site of employment, date of employment loss and nature of employment loss and (ii) the total number of employees at each site of employment listed in response to clause (i) immediately prior to the ninety (90) day     ##### 

  

     

period ending on the Closing Date. Seller shall provide such additional
information, which shall be true and accurate in all respects, that is
reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to current and former employees
employed by Seller with respect to the Business, and shall, at
Buyers request and in the manner reasonably directed by Buyer, provide, or
assist Buyer in providing, notice to some or all employees employed by Seller
with respect to the Business in accordance with the WARN Act.    

 (j) Seller and its Affiliates shall waive any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and any other restrictions that would otherwise limit the scope of any Transferred Employees services to Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to Conferencing Services.    

 8.4. _Intentionally Omitted_.    

 8.5. _Accounts Receivable_. Subject and pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement and _Section 2.5(d)_ hereof, if, on or after the Closing Date, Seller or any of its Affiliates shall receive any remittance from any account debtors with respect to the accounts receivable generated under any Included Customer Contracts that have been assigned to Buyer or otherwise in respect of the Purchased Assets after the Closing Date, Seller or such Affiliate shall forward it to Buyer immediately upon receipt thereof. If, on or after the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall receive any remittance from any account debtors with respect to the accounts receivable generated under any Included Customer Contracts or otherwise in respect of the Business (or by any of Sellers Affiliates) before the Closing Date, Buyer or such Buyer Affiliate shall forward it to Seller immediately upon receipt thereof.    

 8.6. _Sprint Property_. Except as expressly provided herein or in the Sales and Marketing Agreement, Buyer shall not use any intellectual property of Sprint, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including without limitation the name "Sprint" or any trademarks or service marks of Sprint or any of its Affiliates) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation in any of Buyers promotional or marketing materials, without the prior written consent of an officer of Sprint.    

 8.7. _Performance by Sprint Solutions_. Sprint agrees to cause Sprint Solutions to take all such actions under this Agreement (including under _Section 2.5_) with respect to the Included Customer Contracts to which Sprint Solutions is a party as Seller has agreed to take with respect to the Included Customer Contracts. Sprint agrees to cause SUMAC to take all such actions under this Agreement with respect to the Seller Agreements to which SUMAC is a party as Seller has agreed to take with respect to the Seller Agreements.    

 8.8. _License of Assigned Patent_. Buyer hereby grants to Seller and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free and fully paid-up license in the United States to use in their respective businesses inventions claimed in U.S. Patent No. 5,530,472, which Patent is a Purchased Asset. The foregoing license is granted as an accommodation to Seller and its Affiliates on an "as-is" basis and is made without any representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement, each of which are hereby disclaimed. If requested by either Buyer or Seller, each of them agrees to enter into a stand-alone license agreement with customary terms reflecting the foregoing license.     #####

 11.3. _Notice of Claims_.

relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it
shall have been prejudiced by such failure.    

 (b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this _Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.    

 (c) In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any insurance recovery in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer).    

 11.4. _Third Person Claims_.

In any action or proceeding with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such litigation and to retain its own counsel at such partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any action the defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such action.    

 (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) simultaneously with the effectiveness of such settlement, compromise or consent, the Indemnifying Party pays in full the obligation imposed on the Indemnified Party by such settlement, compromise or consent, which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such settlement, compromise or consent and (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates.    

 11.5. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. To the extent that a payment by Buyer or Seller under this _Article XI_ can be properly so characterized under applicable Tax law, such payment shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.     ##### 

  

     

 11.6. _Other Terms of Indemnification_.    

 (a) Neither party shall have any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party for: (i) any consequential or punitive damages or (ii) any other Losses or Expenses that are actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from any other Person (including insurers).    

 (b) Except for remedies that may not be waived under applicable law, (i) this _Article XI_ sets forth the exclusive remedy, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for monetary damages owing from Seller to any Buyer Group Member and from Buyer to any Seller Group Member that arise under this Agreement from the matters described in _Sections 11.1_ and _11.2_ and (ii) each of the parties hereby waives any claim or cause of action for monetary damages that it might assert against the other, with respect to such matters, whether under any statute, common law, regulation or other law. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Article XI_ shall not affect any liability or obligation that any party may have under the Ancillary Agreements.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this  _Article XII_, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement (other than  _Sections 13.2 and_ _13.10_ ) shall be terminated without further liability of any party to the other, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for its willful breach of this Agreement.     ##### 

  

     

ARTICLE XIII    

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_     

 13.1. _Survival of Obligations_. All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise provided in _Article XI_, the representations and warranties contained in _Articles V_  and _VI_ shall terminate on the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided herein, no claim shall be made for the breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Article V_ or _VI_ or under any certificate delivered with respect thereto under this Agreement after the date on which such representations and warranties terminate as set forth in this Section.    

 13.2. _Confidential Nature of Information_. Each party agrees that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which it shall have obtained regarding the other party during the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related documents, and, if the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, each party will return to the other party all copies of nonpublic documents and materials which have been furnished in connection therewith. Such documents, materials and information shall not be communicated to any third Person (other than, in the case of Buyer, to its counsel, accountants, financial advisors or lenders, and in the case of Seller, to its counsel, accountants or financial advisors). No other party shall use any confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely for the purpose of evaluating the proposed purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after the Closing Buyer may use or disclose any confidential information included in the Purchased Assets or otherwise reasonably related to the Business or the Purchased Assets, but only to the extent so related. The obligation of each party to treat such documents, materials and other information in confidence shall not apply to any information which (i) is or becomes available to such party from a source other than the other party, (ii) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such party or its agents, (iii) is required to be disclosed under applicable law or judicial process, but only to the extent it must be disclosed, or (iv) such party reasonably deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or approvals contemplated hereby.    

 13.3. _No Public Announcement_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall, without the approval of the other, make any press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by law or the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued.    

 13.4. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered when delivered personally or when sent by registered or certified mail or by overnight courier service addressed as follows:     #####

 13.5. _Successors and Assigns_.    

 (a) The rights of either party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such party hereto prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of the other, except that the rights of Buyer hereunder may be assigned prior to the Closing, without the consent of Seller, to any corporation or limited liability company all of the outstanding capital stock or membership interests of which are owned or controlled by Buyer or to any general or limited partnership in which Buyer or any such corporation or limited liability company is a general     ##### 

  

     

partner, _provided_ that (i) such assignment shall not result in Buyer or
Seller having to amend its respective Notification and Report Form filed
under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder,
(ii) the assignee shall assume in writing all of Buyers obligations to
Seller hereunder, (iii) Buyer shall not be released from any of its
obligations hereunder by reason of such assignment and (iv) Sellers
obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to the delivery by such
assignee, on or prior to the Closing Date, of a certificate signed on its
behalf containing representations and warranties similar to those made by
Buyer in  _Article VI_. Following the Closing, either party may assign any
of its rights hereunder, but no such assignment shall relieve it of its
obligations hereunder.    

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. The successors and permitted assigns hereunder shall include, in the case of Buyer, any permitted assignee as well as the successors in interest to such permitted assignee (whether by merger, liquidation (including successive mergers or liquidations) or otherwise). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties and successors and assigns permitted by this  _Section 13.5_ any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.    

 13.6. _Access to Records after Closing_.    

 (a) For a period which shall be the later of seven years after the Closing Date and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for Tax purposes, Seller and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records of Seller with respect to the Business transferred to Buyer hereunder to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Seller shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 13.6_. If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Seller may select.    

 (b) For a period which shall be the later of seven years after the Closing Date and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for Tax purposes, Buyer and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records relating to the Business which Seller or any of its Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Seller and its Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 13.6_. If Seller or any of its Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, Seller shall, prior to such disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may select.    

 13.7. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein, the Ancillary Agreements and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto and contain all     ##### 

  

     

representations and warranties, express or implied (including warranties of
fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability or non-infringement), of
the parties with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein,
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings or letters of intent
between or among any of the parties hereto, including the Confidentiality
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented
except by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each
of the parties hereto.    

 13.8. _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.    

 13.9. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.    

 13.10. _Expenses_. Each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and accountants.    

 13.11. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to each of Seller and Buyer. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.    

 13.12. _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request to more effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in possession of, any part of the Purchased Assets and to provide Buyer the functional benefits of the Shared Assets, and, in the case of licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations, agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other commitments, included in the Purchased Assets and the Shared Assets (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of third parties which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing, to cooperate with Buyer at its request in endeavoring to obtain such consent promptly, and if any such consent is unobtainable, to use its commercially     ##### 

  

     

reasonable efforts to secure to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other
manner, or (b) which are otherwise not transferable or assignable, to use its
commercially reasonable efforts jointly with Buyer to secure to Buyer the
benefits thereof in some other manner (including the exercise of the rights
of Seller thereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall relieve Seller of its obligations under _Section 7.3_.    

 13.13. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of Delaware.    

 13.14. _Time is of the Essence_. With respect to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.    

 13.15. _Dispute Resolution_. Subject to _Section 13.15(c)_, in the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination thereof, including claims seeking redress or asserting rights under any law (a " _Dispute_ "), such Dispute shall be resolved as set forth in this  _Section 13.15_.    

 (a) _Negotiation_.     

 (i) _Procedure and Timing_. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute by negotiations between representatives who have authority to settle the controversy. Any party may give the other party written notice of any Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within ten (10) days after delivery of such notice, representatives of both parties will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the matter has not been resolved within sixty (60) days of the disputing partys notice, or it the parties fail to meet within ten (10) days, either party may initiate arbitration of the Dispute as provided below.    

 (ii) _Accompaniment by Attorney_. If a negotiator intends to be accompanied at a meeting by an attorney, the other negotiator must be given at least three (3) business days notice of such intention and may also be accompanied by an attorney. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential and will be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence and state rules of evidence.   

 (b) _Arbitration_.     

 (i) _Procedure and Timing_. Any Dispute that has not been resolved by negotiation as provided above within sixty (60) days (or such longer period as the parties may mutually agree in writing) of the initiation of such procedure will, upon demand of either party, be finally settled by arbitration conducted expeditiously in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Any Dispute involving an amount in controversy of not more than $1,000,000 will be resolved by a single arbitrator mutually selected from a list of arbitrators recognized by the AAA. For any    ##### 

  

   

Dispute involving an amount in controversy in excess of $1,000,000, Buyer
and Seller will each appoint an arbitrator of choice from a list of
arbitrators recognized by the AAA and such appointed arbitrators will appoint
a third arbitrator from the list. The three arbitrators so selected will
resolve the Dispute. The arbitration will be governed by the United States
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrator may be entered by any court with jurisdiction. All
applicable statutes of limitation will apply to any Dispute. The arbitrators
will have no power to award punitive or exemplary damages, to ignore or vary
the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and will be bound to
apply controlling law. The costs of arbitration, including the fees
and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties unless
the arbitration award provides otherwise. Each party shall bear the cost of
preparing and presenting its case.    

 (ii) _Location_. The location of the arbitration will be (a) Omaha, Nebraska, with respect to any arbitration initiated by Seller, and (b) Johnson County, Kansas, with respect to any arbitration initiated by Buyer.   

 (c) _Injunctive Relief_. Nothing in this _Section 13.15_ shall be construed to prevent any party from seeking from a court of competent jurisdiction a temporary restraining order or other temporary or preliminary equitable relief pending final resolution of a Dispute pursuant to this _Section 13.18_.    

 (d) _Attorneys  Fees and Expenses_. In the event suit is brought, arbitration is initiated or an attorney is otherwise retained by either party to enforce the terms of this Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys fees and expenses, and neither party shall be entitled to recover reimbursement, or claim recoverable Losses or Expenses, for its attorneys fees and expenses in connection with any such suit, arbitration or other action.    

 13.16. _Sprint as Party for Limited Purposes_. Sprint is a party to this Agreement solely for the purposes of _Sections 4.4(d)_, _5.3(a)_ , _8.1,_ _8.7_ and  _Article 13_.
