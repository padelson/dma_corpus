<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.1. </B><U><B>Organization and Size of Seller</B></U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Seller is a limited partnership duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. Seller is duly qualified to transact business as a limited
partnership and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which such qualification is required in
connection with Seller&#146;s ownership or leasing of the Purchased Assets or its conduct of the
Business. Seller has full power and authority to own or lease and to operate and use the Purchased
Assets and to carry on the Business as now conducted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;All of the ownership interests of Seller are owned, directly or indirectly, 100% by Sprint
of record and beneficially. There are no agreements, arrangements, options, warrants, calls,
rights or commitments of any character relating to the issuance, sale, purchase or redemption of
any partnership interests in Seller other than with Sprint or one of its Affiliates. Seller&#146;s
financial information as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;5.1(b)</U> is true and correct.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.2. </B><U><B>Operation of the Business</B></U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Except as set forth in<U> Schedule&nbsp;5.2</U>, the Business is conducted solely by, and the
Purchased Assets are directly owned and controlled solely by, Seller.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Without limiting the foregoing, Sprint Solutions, rather than Seller, is the &#147;Sprint
party&#148; that executed certain of the Included Customer Contracts. Sprint Solutions generally
executed such contracts as a signing agent on behalf of Seller and other Affiliates of Sprint that
were separately responsible and obligated for performance of Conferencing Services and other
telecommunications-related services under Bundled Customer Contracts. Sprint Solutions executed
these contracts on behalf of the various applicable Affiliates of Sprint in order to avoid the
necessity of multiple Sprint signatories. All representations, warranties and covenants of Seller
in this Agreement in respect of the Included Customer Contracts apply equally to those contracts
executed by Sprint Solutions, and references to &#147;Seller&#148; in the context of the party to an Included
Customer Contract shall be deemed to also include Sprint Solutions.

the other party during the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the
investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related

obligated by law or the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the other party shall be advised
and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable
release or announcement to be issued.

dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination thereof, including claims seeking redress or asserting rights
under any law (a &#147;<U>Dispute</U>&#148;), such Dispute shall be resolved as set forth in this
<U>Section&nbsp;13.15</U>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U><B>Negotiation</B></U>.




<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Procedure and Timing</U>. The parties will attempt in good faith to
resolve any Dispute by negotiations between representatives who have authority to
settle the controversy. Any party may give the other party written notice of any
Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after
delivery of such notice, representatives of both parties will meet at a mutually
acceptable time and place, and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem
necessary, to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the Dispute.
If the matter has not been resolved within sixty (60)&nbsp;days of the disputing party&#146;s
notice, or it the parties fail to meet within ten (10)&nbsp;days, either party may
initiate arbitration of the Dispute as provided below.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) <U>Accompaniment by Attorney</U>. If a negotiator intends to be
accompanied at a meeting by an attorney, the other negotiator must be given at least
three (3)&nbsp;business days notice of such intention and may also be accompanied by an
attorney. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential and will be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules
of Evidence and state rules of evidence.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U><B>Arbitration</B></U>.




<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Procedure and Timing</U>. Any Dispute that has not been resolved by
negotiation as provided above within sixty (60)&nbsp;days (or such longer period as the
parties may mutually agree in writing) of the initiation of such procedure will,
upon demand of either party, be finally settled by arbitration conducted
expeditiously in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (&#147;AAA&#148;). Any Dispute involving an amount in controversy of
not more than $1,000,000 will be resolved by a single arbitrator mutually selected
from a list of arbitrators recognized by the AAA. For any

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">Dispute involving an amount in controversy in excess of $1,000,000, Buyer and
Seller will each appoint an arbitrator of choice from a list of arbitrators
recognized by the AAA and such appointed arbitrators will appoint a third arbitrator
from the list. The three arbitrators so selected will resolve the Dispute. The
arbitration will be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 1 et
seq., and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any
court with jurisdiction. All applicable statutes of limitation will apply to any
Dispute. The arbitrators will have no power to award punitive or exemplary damages,
to ignore or vary the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and will
be bound to apply controlling law. The costs of arbitration, including the fees and
expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties unless the
arbitration award provides otherwise. Each party shall bear the cost of preparing
and presenting its case.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) <U>Location</U>. The location of the arbitration will be (a)&nbsp;Omaha,
Nebraska, with respect to any arbitration initiated by Seller, and (b)&nbsp;Johnson
County, Kansas, with respect to any arbitration initiated by Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U><B>Injunctive Relief</B></U>. Nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;13.15</U> shall be construed to
prevent any party from seeking from a court of competent jurisdiction a temporary restraining order
or other temporary or preliminary equitable relief pending final resolution of a Dispute pursuant
to this <U>Section&nbsp;13.18</U>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U><B>Attorneys&#146; Fees and Expenses</B></U>. In the event suit is brought, arbitration is
initiated or an attorney is otherwise retained by either party to enforce the terms of this
Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys&#146; fees and expenses, and neither
party shall be entitled to recover reimbursement, or claim recoverable Losses or Expenses, for its
attorneys&#146; fees and expenses in connection with any such suit, arbitration or other action.
