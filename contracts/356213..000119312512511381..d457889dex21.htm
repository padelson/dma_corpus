take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on the fourth Business Day following
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the

nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied), at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and
Crutcher LLP, 2029 Century Park East, Los Angeles, California 90067, unless

in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the NRS, and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make any and all other filings
or recordings required under the NRS. The Merger shall become effective at
such date and time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Nevada
Secretary of State or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company
shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Articles of Merger (the date
and time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects

CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or the holders of any
shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub:

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(such shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) Shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) and (y) any Dissenting Shares) shall
thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the
right of the holder of such Share (the " _Merger Shareholder_ ") to receive
$26.50 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
each such Share shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the
right of the Merger Shareholder of such Share to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Share to be issued or paid in accordance with
Section 2.3, without interest.

(ii) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(iii) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

 



3  converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, cash dividends) or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
achieve the same economic outcome.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, each option to purchase
Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any of the Company
Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding at the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option
immediately following the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest,
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the
product of (i) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share of such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject
to such Company Stock Option (such payments, collectively, the " _Option
Payments_ "); _provided_ , that if the exercise price per Share of any such
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, each restricted
stock unit (each a " _Company Stock Right_ ") granted under any of the Company
Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding at the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay to each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Right
immediately following the Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest,
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares subject
to such Company Stock Right (such payments, collectively, the " _Rights
Payments_ ").

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and
take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.2.

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement (in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Companys transfer

 



4  agent to act as agent for the Merger Shareholders in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger Consideration to which
the Merger Shareholders shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) (i) with the Paying Agent, cash in immediately available funds in
an amount sufficient to make all payments to Merger Shareholders required
pursuant to this Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ "), and (ii) in an account designated by Parent not fewer than
two Business Days prior to the Effective Time, cash in immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the sum of the Option Payments and the Rights
Payments to be used by the Surviving Corporation solely to make the payments
required by Section 2.2 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Option/Rights Payment Fund_ "). Neither the Payment Fund nor the
Option/Rights Payment Fund shall be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments due pursuant to this Article II, except as provided in
this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection with the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and other actions contemplated
by this Article II.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an
outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate (subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by
book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") a check or wire transfer for the amount
of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i)
in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry 

 



5  Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable.

 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), without any
interest thereon.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
(" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
Pacific time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m. Pacific time on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount
in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

(f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the
Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations
to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to Section 2.4),
Parent shall promptly deposit cash in immediately available funds into the
Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of
cash required to fully satisfy such cash

 



6  payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.

 

(h) At any time following the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it, Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to
the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration.

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, and, if required by Parent, providing an appropriate affidavit
and/or the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(j) None of Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent, or
any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such cash
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company
Stock Rights or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.5 _Dissenter s Rights_. If, pursuant to the terms of NRS 92A.300
through 92A.500, holders of Shares are entitled to dissenters rights, then
notwithstanding

 



7  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly demanded and perfected dissenters rights under NRS
92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled to receive such payment from the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Dissenting Shares as shall be determined pursuant to the NRS;
provided, however, that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to dissent
and demand payment of fair value under the NRS, each such Share held by such
holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1(a)(i), and such Share shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any written demands received by
the Company for payment of the fair value (as defined in NRS 92A.320) in
respect of any Shares and attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to NRS 92A.440 and received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals of Shares, offer to settle or settle any demands
or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

12  respective dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments).

 

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities and that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC.

 

(d) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals. The Companys
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls
were effective and the Companys independent registered accountant has issued
(and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011. To the knowledge of the Company, since
January 1, 2012, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Companys
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (A)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (B) any illegal act or fraud related to the operations or
business of the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether or not material, that
involves the Companys management; or (C) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.

by the staff of the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents.

(f) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
rules, regulations and applicable listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock
Market, and has not since January 1, 2009 received any notice asserting any
non-compliance with any of the foregoing.

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
except for liabilities and obligations (a) reflected or reserved against in
the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of 

 



13  December 31, 2011 included in the Company SEC Documents, (b) incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date of such balance sheet, none of
which liabilities or obligations would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) which have been
discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement or (d) incurred
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Since January 1,
2012, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including
contingent obligations), and other relationships with other Persons, that may
have a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures,
capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 3.7 _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") will, at the date it is first mailed
to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1, 2012
through the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement, the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been conducted in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, and there has not been any event, development
or state of circumstances that, individually or in the aggregate, has had a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.9 _Litigation_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (a)
there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding, arbitration, mediation or
investigation (each, an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Designated Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets by or before any Governmental Entity,
(b) no Governmental Entity has since January 1, 2009, challenged or questioned

and 3.14, respectively) and Gaming Laws, the Company and each of its
Designated Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws applicable to them or
by which any of their respective properties are bound, except where any non-
compliance would not, individually or the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Designated
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Gaming Laws applicable to them or by
which any of their respective properties are bound, except where any non-
compliance would not be material to the operations or business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except with respect to Environmental
Laws (which are the subject of Section 3.13), the Company and its Designated
Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with all permits, licenses,
exemptions, authorizations, franchises, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Entities (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary for them to
own, lease or operate their properties and to carry on their businesses as now
conducted, except for any Permits the absence of, or noncompliance with, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. All Permits are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.11 _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) The Company has provided to Parent a true and complete list of each
material "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")),
"multiemployer plans" (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)), and all
material stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-
control, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and all other
employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements,
whether or not subject to ERISA, under which any employee or former employee
of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits
or the Company or its Subsidiaries has had or has any liability (contingent or
otherwise). All such plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements
are collectively referred to as the " _Company Plans_." With respect to each
Company Plan, the Company has furnished or made available to Parent a current,
accurate and complete copy thereof and, to the extent applicable: (i) any
related trust agreement or other funding instrument, (ii) the most recent
determination letter of the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "), if
applicable, (iii) any summary plan description and other equivalent written
communications by the Company or its Subsidiaries to their employees
concerning the extent of the benefits provided under a Company Plan and (iv)
if applicable, for the two most recent years the Form 5500 and
attached schedules.

(b) With respect to the Company Plans:

(i) each Company Plan has, in all material respects, been established and
administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, and no prohibited transaction,
as described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or
accumulated funding deficiency,

 



15  as defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, has occurred
with respect to any Company Plan;

(ii) except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability, all contributions required to be made under the terms of any
Company Plan have been timely made;

 

(iii) each Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination, advisory and/or opinion letter,
as applicable, from the IRS that it is so qualified (or the deadline for
obtaining such a letter has not expired as of the date of this Agreement) and,
to the Companys knowledge, nothing has occurred since the date of such
letter that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualified
status of such Company Plan;

(iv) no Company Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code;

(v) no Company Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA);

(vi) the Company and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any Company Plan that
is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code) that has not been administered and operated in all material respects in
compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA and
Section 4980B(b) of the Code, and the Company and its Subsidiaries are not
subject to any material liability, including additional material
contributions, fines, penalties or loss of Tax deduction, as a result of such
administration and operation;

(vii) no Company Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability of
any of the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide, post-termination or
retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other
post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Law, and none
of the Company, any Subsidiary or any entity, trade or business, whether or
not incorporated, that together with the Company or any Subsidiary, would be
deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (an
" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has any material liability as a result of a failure to
comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code;

(viii) no Company Plan provides for payment of a benefit, the increase of a
benefit amount, the payment of a contingent benefit or the acceleration of
the payment or vesting of a benefit determined or occasioned, in whole or in
part, by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with another
event). No amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether in cash
or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any individuals under any Company Plan will
be an "excess parachute payment," as such term is defined in Section

 



16  280G(b)(1) of the Code. The Company has not taken any action with respect to
2012 annual incentive awards that would cause such awards to be nondeductible
under Section 162(m) of the Code. The Company is not obligated to compensate
any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code;

 

(ix) each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified

operated in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1,
2005, based upon a good faith reasonable interpretation of (A) Section 409A
of the Code and (B) IRS Notice 2005-1 or any other applicable IRS guidance, in
each case as modified by IRS Notice 2007-86 (clauses (A) and (B), together,
the " _409A Authorities_ "). No Company Plan that would be a Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code but for the
effective date provisions that are applicable to Section 409A of the Code, as
set forth in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as
amended (the " _AJCA_ "), has been "materially modified" within the meaning of
Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3, 2004, based upon a good
faith reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the 409A Authorities and has
not been operated in material compliance with the 409A Authorities (except to
the extent it would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability); and 

(x) there are no Actions, audits or inquiries pending, or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened (other than routine claims for benefits) against any,
or with respect to, any Company Plan or fiduciary thereto or against the
assets of any such Company Plan that would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the operations or business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a

No representation is made under this Section 3.17 with respect to any

of Section 3.18.

 

Section 3.18 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all Company Registered IP. To the knowledge of the Company,
no Company Registered IP is involved in any interference, reissue,

action is or has been threatened with respect to any of the Company Registered
IP. All Company Registered IP is solely and exclusively owned by the Company

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Company Registered IP that
remains pending or unresolved.

to safeguard any such information that is accessible through computer systems
or networks.

Rights of any third Person. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice or claim asserting that any such infringement
or misappropriation is occurring or has occurred, which notice or claim
remains pending or unresolved and that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the operations

24  the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, any Intellectual
Property Rights of any third Person. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has issued any notice or claim since January 1, 2009 that a
third Person is misappropriating or infringing any Owned Company Intellectual
Property and no Owned Company Intellectual Property is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree or stipulation restricting or limiting in

a material adverse effect on the operations or business of the Company and

aggregate, a material adverse effect on the operations or business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company or its

to (including the sole right to enforce) the Owned Company Intellectual
Property, free and clear of all Liens, and have not granted any license,
covenant, release, immunity or other right with respect to any material Owned
Company Intellectual Property to any Person other than non-exclusive licenses
granted in the ordinary course of business in connection with marketing and
promotional activities. All of the Company Intellectual Property that is
material to the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and that is not Owned Company Intellectual Property (the "
_Licensed Company Intellectual Property_ ") is duly and validly licensed to
the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid and enforceable contract.

representation or warranty with respect to non-infringement of third Person
Patents, which is addressed separately in Section 3.18(c). Following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation will own or have, and will be permitted to
exercise, the same rights that the Company and its Subsidiaries had
immediately prior to the Closing with respect to Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights (other than off-the-shelf computer programs), in
each case that are material to the operations or business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, without the payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which
the Company or its Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to pay had
this Agreement not been entered into and the transactions not occurred.

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the operations or business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to the knowledge of the
Company, the Company and each Designated Subsidiary has (i) complied in all
material respects with its respective privacy policies and all applicable Laws
relating to privacy and data security, including with respect to
the collection, storage, transmission, transfer, disclosure, and use of

which maintains effective and commercially reasonable administrative,
technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against

unauthorized access, use, modification, or breach of security of Personal
Information maintained by or on behalf of by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the operations or business
of the Company and its

 



25  Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2009, no
Person (including any Governmental Entity) has made any claim or commenced any
action with respect to loss, damage, or unauthorized access, use,
modification, or breach of security of Personal Information maintained by or
on behalf of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. None of the execution,
delivery, or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
or other transactions contemplated herein will or reasonably would be
expected to result in any material violation of any privacy policy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any applicable Law pertaining to privacy, data
security, or Personal Information.

restrictions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "acquisition of controlling

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

PARENT, HOLDCO AND MERGER SUB

Except (a) as disclosed or reflected in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior
to the date of this Agreement (but excluding any risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other
than any specific factual information contained therein), or (b) as set forth
in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any information in a Parent Qualifying SEC Document
or particular section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent),
Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) Each of Parent Entities (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, (ii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except, with respect to clause (iii), for any such
failures to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change, occurrence or effect that would
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the performance by any Parent
Entity of its obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the
ability of Parent to obtain Debt Financing).

(b) Parent has previously furnished to the Company a true and complete copy
of the organizational and governing documents of each Parent Entity, in each
case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in
full force and effect. No Parent Entity is in violation of any provision of
its organizational or governing documents in any material respect.

 



27 Section 4.2 _Authority_. Each Parent Entity has all necessary corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Parent
Entities and the consummation by the Parent Entities of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
each Parent Entity, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of any
Parent Entity are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject in the case of the consummation of
the Merger to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary
of State as required by the NRS. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each Party Entity and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of each Parent Entity, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by
general principles of equity).

 

Section 4.3 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Parent
Entities, and the consummation by the Parent Entities of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate the
organizational or governing documents of any Parent Entity, (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through
(v) of subsection (b) below have been obtained and all filings described in
such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub or by which any of their respective properties are bound
or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default), or
result in the loss of a benefit under, result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or
acceleration of, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by
which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are bound,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, breach,
violation, default, loss, right or other occurrence that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Parent
Entities, and the consummation by the Parent Entities of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except for (i) such filings as may be required under
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and under state securities, takeover and "blue sky"
Laws, (ii) the filings required under the HSR Act and any filings required
under Foreign Antitrust Laws, (iii) such filings and other action as are
necessary to obtain all required Gaming Approvals, (iv) such filings as
necessary to comply with the applicable requirements of The New York Stock
Exchange, (v) the filing with the Nevada Secretary of State of the Articles
of Merger as required by the NRS and (vi) any such consent, approval,
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to

supplied by any Parent Entity for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders
of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Entities make no
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by the
Company or any of its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement.

Section 4.5  _Litigation_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties by or before any Governmental Entity and (b) neither Parent nor any

a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent formed solely for the purpose of engaging
in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein, including the
Debt Financing. Merger Sub is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
that was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger. Since their
respective dates of incorporation and prior to the Effective Time, except for
obligations or liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or
organization and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt
Financing, neither HoldCo nor Merger Sub have incurred, directly or
indirectly, through any subsidiary or Affiliate, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or
kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person. The duly authorized capital stock of HoldCo consists of 150,000,000

HoldCo and Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or
indirectly by Parent.

Section 4.7 _Financing_

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
an executed commitment letter, dated as of December 20, 2012 (such commitment
letter as the same may be amended or replaced pursuant to Section 5.16(c)
except by an Alternative Financing, is referred to herein as the "Debt
Financing Commitment"), among Parent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMCB"),
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC
("Goldman"), pursuant to which, among other things, each of JPMCB and Goldman
has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the

 



29  Debt Financing Commitment, to provide or cause to be provided, on a several
and not joint basis, 50% and 50%, respectively, of the financing commitments
specified in Section 4.7 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, the proceeds of
which are to be used to fund the Merger Consideration and to pay transaction
fees and expenses and/or to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company and
Parent, as specified in the Debt Financing Commitment. The financing
commitments contemplated under the Debt Financing Commitment, as amended or
replaced in compliance with Section 5.16(c), are referred to herein,
individually and collectively, as the "Debt Financing". (b) The Debt
Financing Commitment is, as of the date hereof, in full force and effect. The
Debt Financing Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The Debt
Financing Commitment (or any Debt Financing contemplated thereunder) has not
been or will not be amended or modified, except as consistent with Section
5.16, and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitment has not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, (i) no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a material default or material breach on the part of Parent under
the Debt Financing Commitment, and (ii) subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III hereof
and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section
6.3 hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any material term or condition of closing to be satisfied by
the Debt Financing Commitment on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in or expressly
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, there
are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements
(except for customary fee letters and engagement letters, which do not
contain provisions that impose any additional conditions to the funding of the
Debt Financing not otherwise set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment)
related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as
expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment. As of the date hereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Debt Financing Commitment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment, together with the available cash of Parent and the Company on the
Closing Date (if any) and any Alternative Financing (if any), will be
sufficient for the Parent Entities to consummate the Merger or the
Alternative Merger upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.8 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
vote or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of HoldCo and of HoldCo as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred prior to the
Effective Time) are the only votes or consents of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of HoldCo or Merger Sub necessary to approve this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.9 _Ownership of Shares_. No Parent Entity or any of Parents
Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any
Shares or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares except pursuant to
this Agreement.

other Person, other than Goldman Sachs and Co., is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 4.11 _Licensability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective officers, directors, partners, managers, members, principals or
Affiliates which may reasonably be considered in the process of determining
the suitability of Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub for a Gaming Approval by a
Gaming Authority, or any holders of Parents capital stock or other equity
interests who will be required to be licensed or found suitable under
applicable Gaming Laws (the foregoing Persons collectively, the " _Licensing
Affiliates_ "), has ever abandoned or withdrawn (in each case in response to
a communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a likely or impending
denial, suspension or revocation) or been denied or had suspended or revoked a
Gaming Approval, or an application for a Gaming Approval, by a Gaming
Authority. Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, and each of their respective Licensing
Affiliates which is licensed or holds any Gaming Approval pursuant to
applicable Gaming Laws (collectively, the " _Licensed Parties_ ") is in good
standing in each of the jurisdictions in which such Licensed Party owns,
operates, or manages gaming facilities. To Parents knowledge, there are no
facts which, if known to any Gaming Authority, would be reasonably likely to
(i) result in the denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming
Approval of any of the Licensed Parties or (ii) result in a negative outcome
to any finding of suitability proceedings of any of the Licensed Parties
currently pending, or under the suitability proceedings necessary for the
consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 4.12 _Compliance with Gaming Laws_.

(a) Each of the Licensed Parties, and to Parents knowledge, each of the
Licensed Parties directors, officers, partners, managers, members, key
employees and Persons performing management functions similar to those
performed by officers, partners, or managers, holds all Gaming Approvals and
all such Permits as are necessary to conduct the business and operations of
the Licensed Parties as currently conducted, each of which is in full force
and effect in all material respects (the " _Parent Permits_ "), and no event
has occurred which permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or
both would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification,
suspension, limitation or termination of any Parent Permit that currently is
in effect, the loss of which, either individually or in the aggregate, would
be reasonably likely to materially impair or delay the Closing. Each of the
Licensed Parties, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the Licensed
Parties respective directors, officers, partners, managers, members, key
employees and Persons performing management functions similar to those
performed by officers, partners, or managers (collectively, " _Management
Principals_ "), is in compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits, except
for such failures to comply which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to materially impair or delay the Closing. No Parent
Entity, nor any of their respective Licensing Affiliates has received notice
of any investigation or review by any Gaming Authority or other Governmental
Entity with respect to any Parent Entity, or any of their
respective Licensing Affiliates or Management

 



31  Principals that is pending, and, to the knowledge of Parent, no
investigation or review is threatened, nor has any Gaming Authority or other
Governmental Entity indicated any intention to conduct the same, other than
those the outcome of which would not impair or delay the Closing.

(b) No Licensed Party, and no Licensing Affiliate or Management Principal of
any Licensed Party, has received any written claim, demand, notice, complaint,
court order or administrative order from any Gaming Authority or other
Governmental Entity in the past three years under, or relating to any
violation or possible violation of, any Gaming Law which did or would be
reasonably likely to result in an individual fine or penalty of $250,000 or
more. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no facts which if known to any
Gaming Authority could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
limitation or suspension of a Gaming Approval or other material license,
finding of suitability, registration, permit or approval of the Licensed
Parties, or any of their respective Licensing Affiliates or Management
Principals. None of the Licensed Parties, and none of their respective
Licensing Affiliates or Management Principals, has suffered a suspension,
denial, non-renewal, limitation or revocation of any Parent Permit. 

Section 4.13 _Solvency of the Surviving Corporation_. Immediately following
the Effective Time and after giving effect to the Merger and taking into
account the financing necessary in order to consummate the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries will not (i) be insolvent
(either because their respective financial conditions are such that the sum
of their debts is greater than the fair market value of their assets or
because the fair saleable value of their assets is less than the amount
required to pay their probable liability on their existing debts as such debts
mature); (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in the
Business; or (iii) have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay such debts
as such debts become due.

 

Section 4.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Company
acknowledges that no Parent Entity or any other Person on behalf of any Parent
Entity makes any express or implied representation or warranty to the Company.

Merger Sub to obtain any approvals of any Governmental Entity

 



35  (including any Gaming Approvals) necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (b) otherwise, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.3 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give any of the Parent Entities, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior
to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or
its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 5.4  _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, from and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall not authorize or permit its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly
encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or the making
or completion of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations or discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted

in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve, endorse or recommend, or

agreed that any determination or action by the Company Board permitted under
Section 5.4(b) or (c) or Section 7.1(c)(ii) shall not be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.4(a). The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, and cause its Representatives to cease and cause
to be terminated, any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary will be a breach of this Section 5.4(a) by the Company. The Company
agrees that in the event it releases any Person from, or amends or waives any
provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill," non-solicitation or similar
agreement to which the Company is or becomes a party or under which the
Company has or acquires any rights, it shall release Parent and Subsidiaries
and Representatives of Parent from, and/or shall waive, all such parallel or
analogous provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also will
promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal to return
or destroy in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of the Company.

 



36 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a), at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
5.4(a) and that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and
subject to complying with Section 5.4(d), (i) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement on
terms no less restrictive to such Person than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary
in order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall provide or make
available to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided
or made available to Parent; and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board or any
committee thereof may take the actions described in subsections (i) and (ii)
above only if the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(c), until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall: (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw, modify or amend
or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in any manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger (the
" _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (B) fail to make a statement in
opposition and recommend to the Companys stockholders rejection of a tender
or exchange offer for the Companys securities initiated by a third party
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act within ten
Business Days after such tender or exchange offer shall have been announced
or commenced by such third party, or (C) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the
foregoing in clauses (A)-(C), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or
(ii) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or recommend, or allow
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 5.4(b)) (any of the foregoing, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
may:

(1) in response to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
was made after the date hereof, that did not result from a breach

 



37  of this Section 5.4, and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
constitutes a Superior Proposal (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change if
the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that, in light of the receipt of such Superior
Proposal, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or
(y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) and (only if the Company shall) concurrently with such termination
enter into an Acquisition Agreement if the Company Board has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of
the receipt of such Superior Proposal, the failure to effect such
termination would reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and
any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void
and of no force or effect, unless, prior to or simultaneously with such
termination, the Company pays by wire transfer of immediately available funds
the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(b); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company Board shall not be entitled to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in respect of any such Superior Proposal or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) in respect of any such Superior
Proposal, and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless:

(I) the Company has provided to Parent four Business Days prior written
notice that it intends to take a such action (a " _Notice of Designated
Superior Proposal_ "), which notice shall describe the terms and conditions
of any Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal) that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company
Board (a " _Designated Superior Proposal_ ") and attach the most current form
or draft of any written agreement providing for the transaction contemplated
by such Designated Superior Proposal and all other contemplated transaction
documents (including any agreements with any stockholders, directors or
employees) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of Designated Superior Proposal, and a new four Business Day period); 

(II) at the end of such four Business Day period, such Acquisition Proposal
has not been withdrawn and the Company Board determines in good faith that
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in a binding written offer in response to a Notice of Designated
Superior Proposal which is capable of being accepted by the Company).

(d) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any written Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
written request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) any written inquiry or request
for discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including in
each case the identity of the Person making any such 

 



38  Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and attach a copy of any such written
Acquisition Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to
the Company, the Company shall summarize in writing the terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly
informed in all material respects of the status and details (including any
material change or proposed material change to the terms thereof) of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with prior notice of
any meeting of the Company Board or any committee thereof at which the Company
Board or any committee thereof is expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal or any such inquiry or to consider providing information to any
person or group in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any such
inquiry.

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer
or exchange offer), or (ii) from making any required disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to disclose such
information would reasonably be expected to breach its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of both clause (i)
and clause (ii), any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, may still be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.4(c) unless the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure.

 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within 45 days,
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, with the assistance
of Parent, prepare the Proxy Statement and file the Proxy Statement with the
SEC. Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with each other
in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each of Parent, HoldCo and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company in writing the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof. The Company and each Parent Entity will
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders, in each case, as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give
good faith and reasonable consideration to any

 



39  comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company shall promptly notify
and provide to Parent and its counsel any comments the Company or its counsel
receives from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by
the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than 40
days following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, the Company,
acting through the Company Board, shall (i) take all action necessary to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") and (ii) except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
Section 5.4(c), include in the Proxy Statement a statement to the effect that
the Company Board (A) has unanimously determined that the Merger and this
Agreement are advisable and (B) unanimously recommends that the Companys
stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to
delay, postpone or cancel the Company Stockholders Meeting (but not beyond
the Termination Date) if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or
any committee thereof (after consultation with its legal counsel) the failure
to do so would reasonably be expected to breach the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors and Representatives to, afford to Parent reasonable access during
normal business hours, consistent with applicable Law, to its officers, key
management employees, properties, offices, other facilities and books and
records, and shall promptly furnish Parent with all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent shall reasonably request in writing (it
being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit Parent or its
officers, employees or representatives to conduct any environmental testing or
sampling or other invasive testing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any agreement with any third
party, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other
privilege held by the Company or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law,
including Gaming Laws.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
any and all information or documents furnished pursuant to Section 5.4(d)) in
accordance with the

 



40  confidentiality letter agreement, dated November 15, 2012, between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.7 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law and under any applicable
Gaming Law) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
the earliest practicable date, including: (i) causing the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Merger and the taking of such actions as are necessary to
obtain any requisite consent or expiration of any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act; (ii) taking the steps necessary or desirable to obtain all
consents, approvals (including Gaming Approvals) or actions of, make all
filings with and give all notices to any Governmental Entity or any other
Person required in order to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) defending all lawsuits and
other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; and (iv) resolving any objection
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
under any Antitrust Law raised by any Governmental Entity and preventing the
entry of any court order, and vacating, lifting, reversing or overturning any
injunction, decree, ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Entity
that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 5.7(a),
each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
practicable, and in any event by no later than 15 Business Days from the date
of this Agreement, an appropriate Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the
filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and Parent.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 5.7(a),
Parent and Merger Sub agree to, and agree to cause their Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, partners, managers, members, principals and
stockholders to, prepare and submit to the Gaming Authorities as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no later than 45 calendar days from the date of
this Agreement, all applications and supporting documents necessary to obtain
all required Gaming Approvals.

(d) If a party receives a request for information or documentary
material from any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to a Second
Request for Information under the HSR Act or requests for supporting,
supplemental, or additional documentation from any Gaming Authorities, then
such party shall in good faith make, or

 



41  cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, a response which is, at a minimum, in substantial
compliance with such request.

 

(e) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of or
clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law or applicable Gaming Law and liaising
with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before the relevant
Governmental Entities and as to the contents of all communications with such
Governmental Entities. In particular, to the extent permitted by Law or
Governmental Entity, no party will make any notification in relation to the
transactions contemplated hereunder without first providing the other party
with a copy of such notification in draft form and giving such other party a
reasonable opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the
relevant Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider all
reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect; _provided_
, _however_ , that no party shall be required to provide the other party with
any filings (or related materials) if such party reasonably determines that
the disclosure of filings (or related materials) would be materially
prejudicial to such partys business;

(ii) furnishing to the other party all information within its possession that
is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications (and,
unless precluded by Law, providing copies of any such communications that are
in writing) from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent
permitted by Law or Governmental Entity that each of the parties is entitled
to attend any meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless
a party has a reasonable basis to object to the presence of the other party
at any such meetings or appearances;

(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Laws or
applicable Gaming Laws; and

(v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, consulting and
cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and
other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



42 (f) In addition, Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all other action and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable
under all Antitrust Laws and/or applicable Gaming Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable the expiration of all waiting periods and obtain all Parent
Permits and all other approvals and any other consents required to be obtained
in order for the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (i) placing particular assets or an operating property in trust
upon the Closing pending obtaining control upon subsequent Gaming Approval,
(ii) agreeing to sell, divest, or otherwise convey particular assets or
an operating property of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) agreeing to
sell, divest, or otherwise convey particular assets or an operating property
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, contemporaneously with or subsequent to
the Effective Time.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
obligations of Parent under this Section 5.7 shall not require Parent to take
any action that would require Parent to divest or place in trust, or permit or
cause the Company to divest or place in trust, more than two operating
properties (and under no circumstances more than one operating property in
any one state). No actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be
considered for purposes of determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred.

 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially, competitively and/or personal
sensitive information and materials of a party will be provided to the other
party on an outside counsel-only basis, provided that the parties shall
cooperate to enable appropriate communications to be made available to the
other party with respect to such commercially or competitively
sensitive information redacted if necessary.

Section 5.8 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
may have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to honor and maintain the
severance-related provisions of existing Company Plans with respect to any
Company Employee terminated during that 12-month period.

 

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent
and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2013, to maintain for any Company Employee, subject to
Section 5.8(a) above, cash compensation levels (including salary and bonus
opportunities) that are no less favorable than the cash compensation levels
maintained for and provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and benefits (including the costs

 



43  thereof to Company Plan participants) that are either (x) no less favorable
than those provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (y) substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall restrict Parents ability,
from and after the Effective Time, to change when bonuses are paid to Company
Employees to coincide with when bonuses are paid to the other employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for all purposes
(including eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals), but not
for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans,
under any employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation
and paid time off) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for
the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent,
its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees
service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities
(each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent reflected in the Companys
books and records immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to
each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any
pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees
under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and a Company Employee or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Parent will honor, and will cause its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with its terms, (i) each existing employment, change in control,
severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or
employee of that company, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective
Time under any equity-based, bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or
agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (iii) all obligations in
effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to outstanding restoration or equity-
based plans, programs or agreements, and all vested and accrued benefits under
any employee benefit, employment compensation, deferred compensation, or
similar plans, programs, agreements or arrangements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. This Section 5.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each party hereto, and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement is intended to (A) confer upon any current or former employee or
other service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries any right to
employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation (if applicable) or any Subsidiary thereof (if applicable)), (B)
constitute or create an employment or agreement with, or modify the at-will
status of any, employee or other service provider, or (C) alter any
collective bargaining agreement terms and conditions.

 



44 (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days thereafter,
not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in the Worker Readjustment and Notification Act (29 U.S.C. §2101)
(the " _WARN Act_ ") affecting in whole or in part any site of employment,
facility, operating unit or Company Employee, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries not to take any such action after
such 90-day period without complying with all provisions of the WARN Act, or
any similar provision of applicable foreign Law.

(f) If so directed by Parent, the Company Board, one business day prior to
the Effective Time, will adopt resolutions terminating any and all Plans
intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section
401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
date the Company becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations
(as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent. The form and substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent,
and the Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been
adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of the Subsidiaries, as
applicable.

 

Section 5.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Boards of
Directors shall take such commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary
to render such Law inapplicable to all of the foregoing or to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which, would cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions
being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.10 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the
party receiving such notice; _provided_ _further_ , that failure to give
prompt notice pursuant to clause (c) shall not constitute a failure of a
condition to the Merger set forth in Article VI except to the extent that the
underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing alone

 



45  constitute such a failure. The parties agree and acknowledge that, except
with respect to clause (c) of the first sentence of this Section 5.10, the
Companys compliance or failure of compliance with this Section 5.10 shall
not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition
referred to in Section 6.3(b) shall have been satisfied.

 

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director, manager
or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees
and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with
any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer, director, manager, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any
such Action, (A) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof, within 10 Business
Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified
Party of a request therefor; _provided_ , that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an unsecured undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the NRS, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, or any
indemnification agreement (or form thereof) identified in Section 5.11(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter and in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally liable for the
obligation to provide indemnification to the Indemnified Parties.

 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the

 



46  Company and its Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement (or form
thereof) identified in Section 5.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter and in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time between such Indemnified Party
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute
policies or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase a "tail
policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the
aggregate to the Indemnified Parties than such policy with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. All such policies, including any substitute
policies, shall be issued by carriers rated A, XII or higher by A.M. Best
Company. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid, non-revocable and non-cancellable tail
policy on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such prepaid tail policy has been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any 

 



47  Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Each Parent Entity, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any public announcement without the prior consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange. Parent and the Company agree that the press release announcing the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent
and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Entities and the
Company may make public statements in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences so long as such
statements are substantially consistent with press releases, public
disclosures or public statements previously issued or made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable.

Section 5.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub and HoldCo_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub, HoldCo and the Surviving Corporation to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

Section 5.15 _Consent Solicitation_.

 

(a) At the request and sole expense of Parent, the Company shall promptly at a
time reasonably requested by Parent, commence, or cause its Subsidiaries to
promptly commence, one or more consent solicitations (each, a " _Consent
Solicitation_ "), with respect to certain amendments and waivers to the
indenture (the " _Indenture_ ") governing the Companys publicly traded 7.50%
Senior Notes due 2021 (the " _Notes_ ") on terms and conditions set forth in
Section 5.15 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (or as may otherwise be agreed
between the Company and Parent), and such other customary terms and
conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, and Parent
shall assist the Company in connection therewith. If the Parent elects to
proceed with any Consent Solicitation, the Company shall irrevocably take all
corporate actions necessary for the Consent Solicitation. Promptly following
the expiration date of the Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite
consents are received with respect to the Notes, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall execute a supplement to the Indenture,
amending the terms and provisions of the Indenture as reasonably requested by
Parent and

 



48  as set forth in the Consent Solicitation documents sent to holders of the
Notes (which amendment may include amendments and waivers to certain covenants
contained in the Notes or the Indenture which can be eliminated upon the
favorable vote of the holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof),
which supplemental indenture shall become operative immediately upon the
Effective Time, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the trustee
under the Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or
substantially simultaneously with the Closing. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any Consent Solicitation. Parent hereby
covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided) when due and
payable pursuant to the terms of any Consent Solicitation immediately
available funds to the Company for the prompt and full payment at or prior to
the Effective Time of any consent solicitation fees payable to the holders of
the Notes for all consents properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent
required pursuant to the terms of such Consent Solicitation.

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent, at its own expense,
shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with
any Consent Solicitation, including the consent solicitation statement,
related letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the
" _Consent Solicitation Statement_ ") . Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, agents and representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Consent
Solicitation Statement for each Consent Solicitation. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and the respective agents and representatives (including
accountants, attorneys and other advisors) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide Parent with such financial and other information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, undertake reasonable efforts to
obtain customary accountants comfort letters, if applicable, legal opinions,
and other documentation and items relating to the Consent Solicitation and
execute such documents and take such other actions, in each case, as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to carry out the Consent Solicitation as
contemplated hereunder. Each Consent Solicitation Statement (including all
amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the
Notes in connection with such Consent Solicitation shall be subject to the
prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them. If at any time
prior to the completion of any Consent Solicitation any information in the
Consent Solicitation Statement should be discovered by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other, which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Consent Solicitation Statement, so
that the Consent Solicitation Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated by or on behalf of the Company to the holders of the Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.15, the Company
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if
applicable, and any other Laws applicable in connection with any Consent
Solicitation. In connection with 

 



49  any Consent Solicitation, Parent may select one or more solicitation agents
or, if applicable, dealer managers (which may include JPMCB and Goldman and
their respective Affiliates and any other agents or managers to be reasonably
acceptable to the Company), information agents, and other agents to provide
assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with
such parties so selected and on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent.

(c) If none of the Consent Solicitations undertaken pursuant to Section 5.15
is successful (or if Parent elects not to proceed with any Consent
Solicitation pursuant to Section 5.15), then the Company shall, in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, (i) no later than 30 days, but no earlier
than 60 days, prior to the Effective Time, mail a notice to the trustee under
the Indenture and each holder of the Notes offering to repurchase Notes
pursuant to the change of control provisions of the Indenture and (ii) take
any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to otherwise comply with the
change of control provisions of the Indenture and to facilitate the
satisfaction and discharge of any Notes tendered as part of the change of
control offer to repurchase pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge
provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the Indenture
applicable thereto. Such change of control offer shall be made conditioned
upon the closing of the Merger, and the closing of the change of control
offer shall occur, if at all, on the same day as the Closing Date, or if
requested by Parent on such later date, and such change in control offer
otherwise shall comply with the terms of the Indenture. The redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentences
are referred to collectively as the "Discharge" of the Notes. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Discharge of the Notes.

(d) If the Consent Solicitation with respect to amendments and waivers to the
Indenture necessary to consummate the Alternative Merger is successful, and
the requisite consents to amend the Indenture are obtained on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement, Parent may elect
in its sole discretion to carry out an alternative acquisition structure,
pursuant to which (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent will be merged with
and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation of such
merger, and (ii) immediately following such merger, the surviving corporation
will be merged with and into Parent (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the "
_Alternative Merger_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall not have the
right to implement the Alternative Merger if the same would alter the Merger
Consideration. In the event Parent elects to carry out the Alternative
Merger, the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
Agreement to reflect such Alternative Merger structure subject to the proviso
in the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(e) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company (which may require a
reasonable advance of the amount of such costs, fees and expenses), reimburse
the Company for all documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any
Consent Solicitation and the Specified Amendment. Parent shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the

 



50  Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (other than
any direct indemnification of any solicitation agent or dealer manager, which
shall be indemnified under the applicable solicitation agent or dealer
manager agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall indemnify the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities incurred
by them in connection with any solicitation agent or dealer manager
agreement) for any liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with any
action taken by them pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any Consent
Solicitation and the Specified Amendment; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall not have any obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless any such party or person to the extent it is finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such damages suffered or incurred are
attributable to information provided by the Company that contained a material
misstatement or omission.

(f) The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations set
forth in clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 5.15 if the Company shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations,
regardless of the actual outcome of any Consent Solicitation.

Section 5.16 _Financing_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, at Parents sole expense, provide to Parent and Merger
Sub such cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary, proper
or advisable in connection with the Debt Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation is consistent with applicable Law and does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies and otherwise reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of
Parent Entities and the Parent Financing Sources for the Debt Financing; (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing; provided that any such memoranda or prospectuses may, at the
election of the Parent Entities, contain disclosure and financial statements
with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the
Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor; (iii) as
promptly as reasonably practical, furnishing Parent and the Parent
Financing Sources with financial and other information regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent to prepare any
offering memorandum, confidential information statement, lender presentation
and other materials contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (including
(A) financial (including financial projections) and other information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be provided to the
Parent Financing Sources pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment and (B)
financial information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries of the type
that would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act for a public offering of non-convertible debt securities
of HoldCo or, in the Alternative Merger, Parent (including assistance with the
preparation of pro forma financial statements), or otherwise necessary to
receive from the Companys independent 

 



51  accountants customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort)
with respect to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to be included in such offering memorandum and which, with respect to any
interim financial statements, shall have been reviewed by the Companys
independent accountants as provided in SAS 100) (all such information in this
subsection (iii) of this Section 5.16(a), the " _Required Information_ ");
(iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary accountants comfort
letters (including providing any necessary management representation letters),
legal opinions, appraisals, surveys, title insurance, landlord waivers and
estoppels, non-disturbance agreements, non-invasive environmental assessments
and other documentation and items relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably
requested by Parent and, if requested by Parent or Merger Sub, to cooperate
with and assist Parent or Merger Sub in obtaining such documentation and
items; (v) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and
intercreditor agreements, guarantees, indentures, currency or interest
hedging arrangements, other definitive financing documents, a certificate of
the chief financial officer or other responsible officer of the Company with
respect to the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis to the extent required in connection with the Debt Financing, and other
certificates, opinions, documents and back-up therefor as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (including using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Debt Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral, provided that any such documents shall be effective no
earlier than the Closing Date; (vi) taking all actions reasonably necessary
to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Debt Financing to
evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of preparing
offering documents and establishing collateral arrangements to the extent
customary and reasonable so long as any such actions do not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the Companys and its Subsidiaries business;
(B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock
box arrangements in connection with the foregoing provided that any such
accounts and arrangements shall be effective no earlier than the Closing
Date; and (C) ensure that the solicitation and syndication of the Debt
Financing benefit from the existing lending and banking relationships of the
Company; (vii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements or
indentures on terms satisfactory to Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to direct borrowings or debt incurrences by the Company
contemplated by the Debt Financing; provided that any such documents shall be
effective no earlier than the Closing Date; (viii) entering into any
customary document in connection with the amendment of the Companys current
credit facilities and in connection with a Consent Solicitation and change of
control offer to purchase the Notes, in each case as described in the Debt
Financing Commitment in existence as of the date hereof; and (ix) consent to
the use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos to the extent customary
in connection with marketing the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required, under
the provisions of this Section 5.16 or otherwise in connection with the Debt
Financing, (i) to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the
Effective Time that

 



52  is not advanced or substantially simultaneously reimbursed by Parent or (ii)
to incur any expense unless such expense is reimbursed by Parent on the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII. Parent shall
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with (A) any action taken by them at the
request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 5.16 or in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or (B) any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries). Nothing contained in this Section or otherwise shall require
the Company to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing. All material, non-public information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.16 shall be kept
confidential by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement except
for disclosure to potential lenders and investors and their respective
officers, employees, representatives and advisors as required in connection
with the Debt Financing subject to customary confidentiality protections.

 

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete the Debt
Financing on or before the Closing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Financing Commitments (provided that Parent and Merger Sub may (i)
amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the date of this Agreement (each on a non-
exclusive basis until the Closing Date), or (ii) otherwise replace or amend
the Debt Financing Commitment in effect on the date of this Agreement
(including any Debt Financing contemplated thereunder) so long as such action
would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing (including
with respect to approvals required in connection therewith under any
applicable Gaming Laws) and the terms are not materially less beneficial to
Parent or Merger Sub, with respect to conditionality, than those in the Debt
Financing Commitment as in effect on the date of this Agreement), including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment, or on other terms reasonably acceptable to Parent and not in
violation of this Section 5.16 and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to such Debt Financing in such definitive agreements;
provided, however, that if the Parent Entities have raised through alternative
sources (an " _Alternative Financing_ ") sufficient funds to meet their
obligations to pay the Merger Consideration without any proceeds under one or
more of the Debt Financing Commitments, the Parent Entities shall have no
obligation to arrange any such Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in such respective Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise so long
as (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company of any such Alternative
Financing, and (B) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure
Alternative Financing on terms that are not materially less beneficial to
Parent and Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent). In
the event that all conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment (other than,
with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of equity financing)
have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders to fund the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger on the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the reasonable
best efforts of Parent be deemed to require Parent to bring enforcement
actions to cause such lenders to

 



53  provide such financing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and (B)
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms not materially less beneficial to
Parent and Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent),
in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger as promptly as possible. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (1) all or any portion of the
contemplated Debt Financing (other than any bridge financing) has not been
consummated, (2) all closing conditions contained in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
_provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied) shall have been satisfied or waived, (3) Parent is unable to
secure Alternative Financing in time to permit payment of the Merger
Consideration and consummation of the Merger on or prior to the Termination
Date (as such date may be extended pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i)) and (4) the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or
alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence of this Section 5.16(c)) are available on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements
thereof), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be
used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing. Except as
provided elsewhere in this Section 5.16, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit any Parent Entity from entering into agreements relating to the
Debt Financing or the operation of any Parent Entity or, as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, including adding equity providers or
operating partners (so long as any such agreements or entering into such
agreements would not reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the
Closing (including with respect to approvals required in connection therewith
under any applicable Gaming Laws)).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.16, the
provisions of Section 5.16 shall not limit in any manner the ability of the
Company or Parent to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(v) or the Company to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(c)(iii), in each case as a result of a Financing
Failure, and the sole remedy for any such termination described in Section
7.3(d) shall be the payment by Parent of the Reverse Termination Fee. 

Section 5.17 _Further Assurances Regarding Existing Credit Agreement_. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at Parents
sole cost and expense, any necessary amendments, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the Companys Credit Agreement, dated as
of April 14, 2011 (as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement
dated as of April 16, 2012, the " _Existing Credit Agreement_ "), so that no
Default or Event of Default (each as defined therein) and no mandatory
prepayment under Section 5.02 thereof will exist after giving effect to the
Merger (the " _Specified Amendment_ ") and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the solicitation of such Specified Amendment from
the lenders thereunder.

 



54 Section 5.18 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company will give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation (including any class action or derivative litigation)
against the Company and/or any of its directors or officers relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or other transactions contemplated herein, and no full
or partial settlement of any such litigation, including in each case, any
payment of fees, will be agreed to by the Company (i) without Parents prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and (ii) without an unconditional release of all
defendants from all liability arising out of such litigation. Any such
participation by Parent will be at Parents sole cost and expense.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained (with any termination by
Parent also being an effective termination by HoldCo and Merger Sub):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

 



57 (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated before September 21, 2013,
or, if the Marketing Period has started and is in effect at such date, then
the second Business Day following the expiration of the Marketing Period (the
" _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) if any action
of such party or failure of such party to perform or comply with the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement shall have been the
primary cause of, or resulted primarily in, the failure of the Merger to be
consummated by the Termination Date and such action or failure to perform
constitutes a breach of this Agreement; _provided_ _further_ , that if as of
the Termination Date, all of the conditions precedent to Closing other than
the condition set forth in Section 6.1(d) (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied) shall have been satisfied as of
the Termination Date, then either Parent or the Company may unilaterally
extend the Termination Date for 90 days upon written notice to the other by
the Termination Date, in which case the Termination Date shall be deemed for
all purposes to be so extended; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that with
respect to any such unilateral extension by the Company or Parent, the
Termination Date shall only be extended for the duration (not to exceed 90
days) during which the Debt Financing Commitment (or any alternative debt
financing commitment meeting the requirements of Section 5.16), in each case,
after giving effect to the extension, if any, of the same, remains in full
force and effect; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that if the Merger is
not consummated by the Termination Date as a result of a Financing Failure,
then, notwithstanding the first proviso of this Section 7.1(b)(i), Parent
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(v). For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate Parent to
seek or obtain any extension of the Debt Financing Commitment (or, after
September 21, 2013, to seek any alternative debt financing commitment meeting
the requirements of Section 5.16).

(ii) if the Company or any Parent Entity receives a definitive oral or
written notice or determination from any Gaming Authority or the staff of any
Gaming Authority that a Parent Entity will not be granted any Gaming Approval
by such Gaming Authority that is required in order for the condition set
forth in Section 6.1(d) to be satisfied; _provided_ , that neither party shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(ii)
if any action of such party or failure of such party to perform or comply
with the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement
shall have been the primary cause of, or resulted primarily in, any such
Gaming Authoritys refusal to grant any such Gaming Approval; 

(iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
shall have issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such judgment, order,
injunction, rule, decree or other action shall have become final
and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(iii) shall have used its reasonable
best efforts to contest, appeal and remove such judgment, order, injunction,
rule or decree, ruling or other action in accordance with Section 5.7;

 



58 (iv) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the adoption of this Agreement was
taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party will not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(iv) if the failure
to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval results from a failure on the part
of such party to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in
this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the
Effective Time; or

(v) if the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 are
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are reasonably capable
of being satisfied) and the Parent Entities are unable to satisfy
their obligation to effect the Closing at such time because of a Financing
Failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Termination Date, Parent
will not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(b)(v) if Parent has materially and willfully, intentionally or knowingly
breached the Financing Covenants;

(c) by the Company: 

(i) if Parent, HoldCo or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 and (B) cannot be cured
by the Termination Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall have given
Parent written notice, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination
(or if such breach or failure to perform occurs within 30 days of the
Termination Date, delivered within 7 days of such breach or of the date such
performance was due), stating the Companys intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) and the basis for such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i) if it is
then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement;

(ii) only prior to having obtained the Company Stockholder Approval, in order
to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, if prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company has complied with the provisions
of Section 5.4, and (C) prior to or concurrently with such termination, the
Company pays the Company Termination Fee due under Section 7.3; or

(iii) if all the closing conditions contained in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are reasonably capable
of being satisfied) and Parent fails to fund the Payment Fund at the Closing;

 

(d) by Parent:

 



59 (i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 and (B) cannot be cured by the
Termination Date;  _provided_ , that Parent shall have given the Company
written notice, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination (or if
such breach or failure to perform occurs within 30 days of the Termination
Date, delivered within 7 days of such breach or of the date such performance
was due), stating Parents intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(d)(i) and the basis for such termination; _provided_
_further_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material
breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; or

 

(ii) if a Triggering Event has occurred at any time prior to the receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1
(other than pursuant to Section 7.1(a)) shall give notice of such termination
to the other party.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, except that if there has been any material and willful,
intentional or knowing (i) failure of any party to perform its
covenants, agreements or obligations hereunder or (ii) breach by any party of
its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, then such
party will be fully liable for any liabilities or damages suffered by the
other parties hereto as a result of such failure or breach. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated as a result of a Financing Failure, the Companys sole
and exclusive remedy shall be the payment by Parent of the Reverse
Termination Fee to the Company, if any, as provided in Section 7.3.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.2(a) above, in the
event of termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of Sections 3.21 and 4.10 (Brokers), Section 5.13 (Public
Announcements), Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 7.3 (Fees and

8.10 (Enforcement), Section 8.11 (Severability), Section 8.12 (Waiver of Jury
Trial), and Section 8.15 (No Presumption Against Drafting Party) of this
Agreement shall survive the termination hereof.

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.7(b), Section 5.15(e) or this
Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the

 



60  Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except that the expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing
fees) and the solicitation of the Company Stockholder Approval shall be shared
equally by Parent and the Company.

 

(b) If:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(iv) and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the taking of a vote to approve this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to the senior management of
the Company or the Company Board or shall have been publicly announced or
publicly made known to the stockholders of the Company, and not withdrawn
prior to such vote to adopt this Agreement, and (B) within 12 months after
such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or shall have consummated, such Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 7.3(b)(i), the references to
"20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section

Triggering Event;

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii); or

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii);

 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of
$38,000,000 in cash (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be
made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated
by Parent (A) upon the consummation of any transaction contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal in the case of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant
to Section 7.3(b)(i), (B) as promptly as practicable, but in any event no
later than two Business Days, after termination of this Agreement by Parent
in the case of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Sections
7.3(b)(ii) or (iv), or (C) prior to or simultaneous with such termination of
this Agreement by the Company in the case of a Company Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Sections 7.3(b)(ii) or (iii); provided, however, that with
respect to any payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(b)(i) above, the amount, if any, of any payment made by the Company to
Parent pursuant to Section7.3(c) below shall be deducted from the amount of
the Company Termination Fee payable to Parent in such instance.

 



61 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this Agreement
is terminated and the Company Termination Fee is payable to Parent pursuant
to this Section 7.3(b), then, in such instances, Parents right to receive the
Company Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Parent Entities and their
respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parent Entities and their respective Affiliates against the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(b)(iv), and prior to such termination there shall not have
been a Triggering Event, then the Company shall as promptly as practicable,
but in any event no later than two Business Days, after the termination of
this Agreement (in the case of a termination by Parent) or prior to or
simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement (in the case of a
termination by the Company), reimburse Parent for fifty percent (50%) of all
Transaction Expenses, up to a maximum reimbursement of $12,500,000 by the
Company.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section
7.1(b)(v) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii), and at the time
of any such termination (A) each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1
and Section 6.3 has been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied), (B) there exists an uncured Financing
Failure, and (C) none of the circumstances described in Section 7.3(b) are
applicable, except in the case (1) where a Financing Failure was directly and
primarily caused by a breach of any express obligation of the Company under
this Agreement and such breach is not cured within 30 days after written
notice thereof by Parent to the Company specifying such breach in
particularity, or (2) of the occurrence of the events described in either
Sections 8.3(w)(A) or 8.3(w)(C) (clauses (1) and (2), a " _Company Causation
Exception_ "); or

 

(ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(b)(i) due to the
failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.1(d), or (B) Section
7.1(b)(ii);

then, in any such case, Parent will pay to the Company, at the time specified
in the next sentence, a termination fee of $85,000,000 in cash (the "
_Reverse Termination Fee_ "). In the case of termination of this Agreement by
the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i), Section 7.1(b)(v) or Section
7.1(c)(iii) under the circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(d)(i) (other than
in the event of a Company Causation Exception), or by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(i) under the circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(d)(i) or
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), the Reverse Termination Fee will be paid by
Parent as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than two Business
Days, after such termination, and in the case of termination of this
Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(v) under
the circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(d)(i), or by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(i) under the circumstances set forth in Section 7.3(d)(ii)

 



62  or pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii), the Reverse Termination Fee will be paid
by Parent prior to or simultaneous with such termination.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated and the Reverse Termination Fee is payable to the
Company pursuant to Section 7.3(d), then, in such instances, the Companys
right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee:

(i) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing and Debt Financing Commitment, and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; and

(ii) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates
against the Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the other Parent Entities),
the Parent Financing Sources and any of their respective former, current, or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, affiliates, employees, representatives or agents ("
_Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, and none of the Parent Entities, the
Parent Financing Sources or any of the Parent Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any
Financing Failure, the Parent Financing Sources will not have any liability of
any nature (for any breach of this Agreement or of the Debt Financing
Commitment) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to any stockholder
or Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The parties agree that
the Reverse Termination Fee (whether or not payable due to a Company Causation
Exception) and the agreements contained in Section 7.3(d) are an integral
part of the Merger and that the Reverse Termination Fee (whether or not
payable due to a Company Causation Exception) constitutes liquidated damages
and not a penalty. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except for Parents obligation to pay to the
Company the Reverse Termination Fee if and when such Reverse Termination Fee
becomes payable by Parent to the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(d): 

(A) neither Parent, HoldCo, Merger Sub nor any other Parent Related Parties
will have any liability (1) for any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.7 or any other representation or warranty
relating to the Debt Financing (regardless of whether such representation or
warranty refers specifically to the Debt Financing), or (2) any breach of any
of the Financing Covenants; and

(B) in the event of any Financing Failure, none of Parent, its Subsidiaries
(including the other Parent Entities), the Parent Financing Sources or any of
Parent Related Parties will have any liability of any nature (for any breach
of this Agreement or any breach in connection with the Debt Financing or
Debt Financing Commitment) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
any stockholder or Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



63 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, following the termination of
this Agreement, in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and
the Company will ensure that the Companys and its Subsidiaries and their
respective controlled Affiliates do not) seek to recover any money damages or
losses, or seek to pursue any other recovery, judgment, damages or remedy
(including any equitable remedy) of any kind, in connection with any
inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to in the clause (A) above or in
connection with any Financing Failure (except that the Company may seek to
recover the Reverse Termination Fee if and when such Reverse Termination Fee
becomes payable by Parent to the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(d). 

(f) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other
party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for the
amounts set forth in Section 7.3, such party shall pay other party its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to the applicable provisions of this Section 7.3 from the date such payment
was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending
rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

Section 7.4  _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, no amendment may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the
amendment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section
5.16, Section 7.3, Section 7.4, Section 8.7, Section 8.8, Section 8.10 and
Section 8.12 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of such Sections) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that impacts or is adverse in any material respect to the Parent
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Parent Financing
Sources.

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
boards of directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
