likely to arise) (a "Tax Issue") the Buyer shall, or shall procure that a
Group Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, give written notice
(the "Notice of Claim") of the Tax Issue to the Seller's Representative but
such notice shall not be a condition precedent to the liability of the Seller
under this Schedule.

shall or shall procure that a Group Company shall supply the Seller's
Representative with such available and relevant details, documentation,
correspondence and information and shall (subject to Paragraph 5.5 of this
Schedule 8) take such action as the Seller's Representative may reasonably
request in writing to negotiate, avoid, dispute, resist, compromise, defend or
appeal against the Tax Issue and any adjudication in respect of the Tax Issue

---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the Seller's Representative shall not be entitled to require a
Group Company to delegate the conduct of such action (or any part of it) to
himself, the Seller or any agent or professional adviser of the Seller; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the Seller shall first indemnify and (to the extent reasonably
required by the Buyer taking into account the relative size of any potential
liabilities and resources of and available to the Seller) secure any Group
Company and the Buyer to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer against any
loss, damages, reasonable costs, reasonable expenses and
liabilities (including any additional Tax) which may be suffered or incurred
as a consequence of any action taken in accordance with this Paragraph 5 of
this Schedule 8 and shall put in place arrangements with which the Buyer,
acting reasonably, is satisfied to ensure that the Seller pay all sums that
may become due under this Schedule 8 in respect of the Tax Schedule Claim.

   | 5.3| If the Seller's Representative does not request the Buyer or a
Group Company to take action pursuant to this Paragraph 5 of this Schedule 8
within twenty-one (21) days of the Notice of Claim being given, or the Seller
fails to indemnify the Buyer or a Group Company concerned, or entered into
arrangements, as provided for in Paragraph 5.2(b) of this Schedule 8 above in
either case to the satisfaction of the Buyer and the relevant Group Company,
the Buyer or a Group Company shall be free to pay or settle the Tax Issue on
such terms as they may in their absolute discretion think fit without further
reference to the Seller or the Seller's Representative. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 5.4| The Buyer shall keep the Seller's Representative reasonably
informed of the progress in settling the relevant Tax Issue and shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable, forward or procure to be forwarded to the

the following action: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| agreeing to the settlement or compromise of any Tax Issue or any

affect the future liability to Tax of a Group Company, the Buyer or any
member of the Buyer's Group; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| contesting any Tax Issue before any tribunal, court or other
appellate body unless, at the sole expense of the Seller, the Seller's
Representative obtains the written opinion of Tax counsel of appropriate
relevant experience (and agreed with the Buyer, such agreement not to be
unreasonably delayed or withheld) after disclosure of all relevant
information and documents and having regard to all the circumstances, that on
the balance of probabilities the action is more likely than not to succeed; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| complying with any unreasonable instruction of the Seller's
Representative or taking any action or procuring the taking of any action
which it reasonably considers (i) may affect the future liability to Tax of a
Group Company, the Buyer or any member of the Buyer's Group or (ii) may be
prejudicial to the Tax, commercial or financial interests or the business of a
Group Company, the Buyer or any member of the Buyer's Group, or any person
connected with them, or the normal administration and conduct of the Tax
affairs of any Group Company, the Buyer or any member of the Buyer's Group,
or any person connected with them or any dealing they may have with a Tax
Authority or (iii) is unreasonable or contrary to the legal obligations of a
Group Company, the Buyer or any member of the Buyer's Group, or any person
connected with any of them or (iv) is not likely to result in a material
reduction in the Seller's liability pursuant to this Schedule 8; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| taking any action against any person who is at the time in
question either an employee or director of any member of the Buyer's Group,

pending investigation or any Court judgment, that the Seller (at any time) or
a Group Company (prior to the Completion Date) has committed any act or
omission constituting fraud or gross negligence relating to any issue
(including Tax), Paragraphs 5.2 to 5.5 of this Schedule 8 shall not apply and

Paragraphs.

making, provision, withdrawal or amendment was taken into account in the

---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.1| If a Group Company or the Buyer is on or before the date which
falls six (6) months after the seventh (7th) anniversary of Completion

reasonably practicable give notice of such fact to the Seller's
Representative and if the Seller indemnifies the Buyer or as appropriate a
Group Company (to the Buyer's reasonable satisfaction) against any Tax that
may be suffered on receipt of any payment and any charges, reasonable costs
and expenses of the Buyer or as appropriate a Group Company in connection
with taking the following action, the Buyer shall or shall procure that a
Group Company shall take such action reasonably requested by the Seller's
Representative to enforce recovery against that person or Tax Authority, save
where the Buyer reasonably considers that to do so may affect the future
liability to Tax of a Group Company, the Buyer or any member of the Buyer's
Group, or otherwise may be materially prejudicial to the Tax, commercial or
financial interests or the business of a Group Company, the Buyer or any
member of the Buyer's Group, or any person connected with them, or
any dealing they may have with a Tax Authority or is unreasonable or contrary
to the legal obligations of any of them or of any person connected with any

paid gross, free and clear of any rights of counterclaim or set-off and
without any deduction or withholding, unless the deduction or withholding is

retained (free of any liability) by the Buyer will equal the full amount that
would have been received by it if no such deduction or withholding had been
required, provided that this Paragraph 8.1 of this Schedule 8 shall not apply
to any interest payable under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.2| Where any payment is made to the Buyer under this Schedule and
that sum is subject to a charge to Taxation in the hands of the Buyer, the

would have received in the absence of such a charge to Taxation. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3| Where, under the terms of this Schedule 8, one Party is liable to
indemnify or reimburse another Party in respect of any costs, charges or

endeavours to recover such amount of VAT as may be practicable. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

118

 



    



   | 8.4| If any payment under this Agreement constitutes the consideration
for a taxable supply for VAT purposes then, in addition to that payment, the
payer shall pay, or if the reverse charge procedure applies account for, any
VAT due, subject, unless the reverse charge procedure applies, to provision
of a valid VAT invoice. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.5| If the Buyer would, but for the availability of a Buyer's Relief
or an Accounts Relief, incur a charge to Taxation falling within Paragraph
8.2 of this Schedule 8 it shall be deemed for the purposes of that Paragraph

result of the application of section 710 or 713 CTA 2010 or otherwise

Seller in connection with taking any successful action under this
paragraph) but only in circumstances where the Tax is directly or primarily
chargeable or attributable to the Group Company and arises: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| in respect of income profits or gains earned, accrued or received
in respect of any period after Completion; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| as a consequence of or by reference to the Group Company failing
to discharge any Tax for which it is liable at any time after Completion
where (and to the extent that) such Tax Liability arises in circumstances such
that (but only to the extent that) the Buyer would not have been entitled to
make a claim against the Seller under the Tax Covenant in respect of such Tax
liability had it been paid by the Group Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.2| A payment to be made by the Buyer under this paragraph 9 shall be

payment_ ), 5 _(Conduct of Claims)_ and 8 ( _Grossing up_ ) of this tax
covenant shall apply in exactly the same manner to this paragraph.
