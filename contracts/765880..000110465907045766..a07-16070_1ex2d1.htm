(c) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a reasonably detailed calculation by Buyer of the Aggregate Company
Indebtedness (the " _Aggregate Company Indebtedness Statement_ ") and the

Statement to (i) confirm the calculation of the Aggregate Company
Indebtedness and to review the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the

Net Assets set forth on the Preliminary Net Assets Statement (the " _Dispute
Notice_ "), specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail.

  

(e) In connection with Sellers review, Seller and its Representatives shall
have reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared by Buyer or its Representatives in connection with its preparation

finance personnel of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and any other information
that Seller reasonably requests, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate reasonably with Seller and its Representatives in
connection therewith.

  

(f) In the event that Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer, Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly
as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the
Aggregate Company Indebtedness Statement and/or Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet and Preliminary Net Assets shall be made in accordance with the
agreement of Buyer and Seller. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any
such dispute within ten (10) Business Days of Sellers delivery of such
Dispute Notice (or such longer period as Buyer and Seller shall mutually
agree upon in writing), such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm, and such determination shall be final and binding on the
parties. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts as to which Buyer and Seller have disagreed upon within the time
periods and on the terms specified above. The Independent Accounting Firm
may rely only upon information submitted to it by Buyer or Seller. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use

       

reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer and Seller a written report
setting forth the resolution of each disputed matter within thirty (30) days
of submission of the Aggregate Company Indebtedness Statement and/or
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and Preliminary Net Assets to it and, in
any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. Any expenses
relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of
its services pursuant to this _Section 2.3(f)_ shall initially be shared
equally by Seller and Buyer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all fees and
expenses relating to the foregoing work by the Independent Accountant Firm
shall ultimately be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation also will be determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm and be included in the Independent Accounting Firms written
report. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Net Assets,
(i) if no Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by Seller, as originally
submitted by Buyer, or (ii) if a Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by
Seller, as determined pursuant to the resolution of such dispute in
accordance with this _Section 2.3(f)_ , shall be, respectively, the " _Final
Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Final Net Assets_." The Aggregate Company
Indebtedness set forth on the Aggregate Company Indebtedness Statement, (i)
if no Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by Seller, as originally
submitted by Buyer, or (ii) if a Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by
Seller, as adjusted pursuant to the resolution of such dispute in accordance
with this _Section 2.3(f)_ , shall be the " _Final Aggregate Company
Indebtedness_."

  

(g) If the Final Net Assets exceeds the Estimated Net Assets, Buyer shall pay
the amount of such excess to Seller, less the amount of any Taxes required to
be withheld, including pursuant to Section 1445(a) of the Code and
corresponding provisions of state Law. If the Estimated Net Assets exceeds
the Final Net Assets, Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to Buyer.
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Net Assets pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_
, make payment to the other by wire transfer in immediately available funds
of the amount payable by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, in respect of
the Final Net Assets Adjustment, together with interest thereon from the
Closing Date to the date of payment, at a floating rate equal to the U.S.
dollar prime rate per annum, as quoted by Citibank, N.A. from time to time
during such period. Such interest shall be calculated based on a year of 365
days and the number of days elapsed since the Closing Date.

  

(h) If the Estimated Aggregate Company Indebtedness exceeds the Final
Aggregate Company Indebtedness, Buyer shall pay the amount of such excess to
Seller, less the amount of any Taxes required to be withheld, including
pursuant to Section 1445(a) of the Code and corresponding provisions of state
Law. If the Final Aggregate Company Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated
Aggregate Company Indebtedness, Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to
Buyer. Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business
Days after the determination of the Final Aggregate Company Indebtedness
pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ , make payment to the other by wire transfer in
immediately available funds of the amount payable by Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, in respect of the Final Aggregate Company Indebtedness
Adjustment, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date
of payment, at a floating rate equal to the U.S. dollar prime rate per annum,
as quoted by Citibank, N.A. from time to time during such period.
Such interest shall be calculated based on a year of 365 days and the number
of days elapsed since the Closing Date.

       

(i) The parties agree that any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.3_
will be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(f) (i) No condemnation or rezoning proceedings are pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to any of the Company
Properties, and (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller, no Laws including any zoning
regulation or ordinance, building or similar Law, code, ordinance, order or
regulation have been violated for any Company Property, or will be violated
by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other
improvements on any of the Company Properties or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas located thereon or
appurtenant thereto or used in connection therewith, in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii) above, which would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(g) All work required to be performed, payments required to be made and
actions required to be taken prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to
any application, submission or agreement the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company has entered into with a

       

Governmental Authority in connection with a site approval, zoning
reclassification or other similar action relating to any Company Properties
(e.g., local improvement district, road improvement district and/or
mitigation) have been and are being performed, paid or taken, as the case may
be, in accordance with said application, submission or agreement and with
applicable Laws, other than those where the failure to perform, pay or take
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(h) The material improvements on each parcel of Company Property have legal
and valid access to (and with respect to each Development Property will have
access to upon completion thereof) such sewer, water, gas, electric,
telephone and other utilities and all driveways, roads and other means of
egress and ingress to and from any of the Company Properties as are necessary
to allow the business of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries operated
thereon for its current use (or, with respect to each Development Property
for its contemplated use upon completion thereof), except where the failure
to have such access, individually or in the aggregate, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The major structural elements of the improvements comprising
the Company Property, including, mechanical, electrical, heating,
ventilation, air conditioning or plumbing systems, elevators or parking
elements, are in sufficiently good condition (except for ordinary wear and
tear) to allow the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
operated for its current use, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is
no physical damage to any Company Properties to an extent which would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No material Company Property is located in a special flood
hazard area designated by any Governmental Entity. Each Company Property has
sufficient parking that complies with all applicable Law (including variances
and legal non-conforming approvals) except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company Properties is an independent property that does not rely on
any facilities (other than public facilities, public roads and off-site
parking) located in any real property which is not a Company Property to
fulfill any requirement of any Governmental Entity or for the furnishing
to such Company Property of any essential building system or utility, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notices
from lenders or insurance carriers requiring material repairs or other
material alterations to Company Properties which have not been completed as
of the date of this Agreement.

  

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(j)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any unexpired
option agreements or rights of first refusal, rights of first offer or other
similar pre-emptive rights with respect to the purchase or lease of a
Company Property or any portion thereof or interest therein or any other
unexpired rights in favor of any third party to purchase, lease or otherwise
acquire a Company Property or interest therein, which, in each case, would be
triggered by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
hereunder.

  

(k) _Section 3.14(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of each lease, ground lease or
other occupancy

       

agreement pursuant to which the Company or any Subsidiary, as a landlord,
leases space in a Company Property (individually, " _Company Lease"_ and
collectively, " _Company Leases_ "). The rent roll provided by Seller to
Buyer, dated May 1, 2007, and attached to _Section 3.14(k)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _Rent Roll_ "), further identifies each
Company Lease as of the date of such Rent Roll. Each Company Lease is in full
force and effect and is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its
terms against the Company or the relevant Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, the other parties thereto, except (i) that such enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors and general principles of equity (whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought or (ii) as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. All information set forth in the Rent Roll is true,
correct and complete in all material respects as of the date hereof. Except
as listed in _Section 3.14(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, or as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries have each
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each
of the Company Leases and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in default under any Company Lease, which default, individually or in
the aggregate with all other such defaults, would be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect (and to the Knowledge of Seller, no event has
occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
such a default). _Section 3.14(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter includes,
as of the date hereof, any Company Lease which has been executed for which
the term has not yet commenced. Seller has made available to Buyer a
correct and complete copy of each Company Lease and all amendments thereto
or modifications thereof.

  

(l) All rent and other amounts due under the Company Leases have been
properly calculated and billed to tenants in all respects pursuant to the
Company Leases, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(m) To the Knowledge of Seller, no guarantor(s) of any Company Lease has been
released or discharged voluntarily from any obligation under or in connection
with any Company Lease or any transaction related thereto.

  

(n) There are no leasing commissions or similar payments that are in respect
of any of the Company Leases, except (i) as reflected in the Financial
Statements and (ii) customary leasing commissions or similar payments that
pertain to the Company Leases listed in the Rent Roll.

into account any extension of time within which to file) all material Tax
Returns required to be filed by any of them in the manner provided by Law and
all such filed Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all material
respects and (ii) paid all material Taxes due and payable (other than Taxes
being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for which
appropriate reserves have been established on the Financial Statements).  No
claim has been

       

made in writing by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or such
Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of
the dates of the Financial Statements, exceed the accrued liability for Taxes
due and payable or the reserve for such Taxes set forth thereon (excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income), and (ii) will not, as of the Closing Date,
exceed such accruals to the extent they are both (A) reflected on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and (B) included in the calculation of the Final Net
Assets. Since the date of the most recent Financial Statements, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for
Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with
past custom and practice, except for Taxes resulting from one or more
transactions that are contemplated or authorized by this Agreement.

each case, pending or threatened in writing against the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries, in respect of material Taxes or material Tax matters.
No statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes have been waived by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to any extension of time with respect to a
material Tax assessment or deficiency. The Company has made available to
Buyer true and correct copies of the United States federal and state income
Tax Returns (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amended Tax Returns)
filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries for each of the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

  

(e) There are no liens for material Taxes on any asset of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

  

(f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
stockholder or other third party.

the Subsidiaries have elected to be taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

  

(h) The Company received a study prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, a
true and correct copy of which has been made available to Buyer, indicating
that, as of December 31, 2006, the aggregate current and accumulated earnings
and profits of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as determined for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, was approximately $5,310,410.

parent of which is the Company), (ii) become a successor to any entity by way
of merger, liquidation or other transaction, or (iii) any liability for Taxes
of another Person by Contract, operation of Law or otherwise.

  

(j) None of the Company, any Subsidiary or predecessor, has within the past 3
years been a party to a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of
the Code or under so much of Section 356 of the Code as relates to Section
355 of the Code.

  

(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to include any
item of income in or exclude any item of deduction from taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of (i) a change in the method of accounting for a taxable period (or
portion thereof) entered on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) a transaction
under Section 1031 of the Code which has not been completed or a prior
installment sale transaction or (iii) an intercompany transaction or excess
loss account described in Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 1502
or any corresponding state or local law.

Section 4.7 _Funding_

  

(a) _Exhibit A_ sets forth a true, accurate and complete copy of the executed
commitment letter from Bank of America, N.A., Banc of America Securities LLC,
UBS Loan Finance LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Barclays Capital, the investment
banking division of Barclays Bank PLC (collectively, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, the lender parties thereto have committed to lend the amounts set
forth therein to Buyer for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Financing_ ").

  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full
force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing Commitments, in
the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and,
to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto. There are no other
agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing
Commitments that could affect the availability of the Financing.  No event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term or
condition of the Financing Commitments, and Buyer has no reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing
Commitments. Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of
the financing required to be provided to Buyer, and are sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Buyers obligations under this Agreement in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
payment of the Purchase Price and the payment of all associated costs and
expenses (including any refinancing of Indebtedness of Buyer or the Company
required in connection therewith, the " _Required Amount_ ").  The Financing
Commitments contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Buyer on the terms
therein. As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments
has been withdrawn and Buyer does not know of any facts or circumstances that
may be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitments not being satisfied.

conditions regarding Buyers, its Affiliates or any other Persons ability
to obtain financing for the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(d) Each of Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be Solvent
following the Closing, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement, including any Indebtedness incurred in connection
therewith.

  

Section 4.8 _Brokers  Fees_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
have entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person
or firm that may result in the obligation of Seller to pay any finders fees,
brokerage or agents commissions or

       

other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this
Agreement or consummation of the Sale.

  

Section 4.9 _No Reliance_

  

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of the financial condition, liabilities, results of
operations and projected operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the nature and condition of their respective properties, assets and
businesses and, in making the determination to proceed with the transactions
contemplated hereby, has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties set forth in _Article
III_. Buyer acknowledges that none of Seller, the Company or their respective
Affiliates nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding Seller or the Company or their respective Affiliates, the
businesses they conduct or other matters that is not expressly and
specifically included in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, none of Seller, the Company or their respective Affiliates nor
any other Person has made a representation or warranty to Buyer with respect
to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets for the businesses of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) any material, documents or
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether written or
oral, made available to Buyer or its Representatives in any "data room,"
offering memorandum, Offering Materials, management presentations, due
diligence discussions or otherwise, except as expressly and to the extent
specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth in _Article
III_.

  

(b) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company, Buyer has
received from Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives certain projections and other forecasts, including but not
limited to projected financial statements, cash flow items, other data of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and other
forecasts and plans and accordingly is not relying on them, (ii) Buyer is
familiar with such uncertainties, (iii) Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and (iv) Buyer and its
Affiliates and their Representatives shall have no claim against any Person
with respect thereto.  Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that, without limiting
the generality of  _Section 3.24_ , neither Seller, the Company nor any of
their respective Representatives, agents or Affiliates, have made any
representation or warranty with respect to such projections and other
forecasts and plans.

of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with

restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of
Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, whether or not

their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be a breach of this
_Section 5.3(a)_.

  

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately terminate all
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party with respect to, or
any that would reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplate the

event later than five (5) Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement) demand that each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with Seller or any of its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with respect to
such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal (other
than agreements that have expired by their terms) to immediately return or
destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing by such Person to
Seller) all confidential information heretofore furnished by Seller, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or Representatives to
such Person, the Subsidiaries of such Person or any of its or their
Affiliates or Representatives. The parties agree that in no event shall
Buyer be deemed an Affiliate of Seller or the Company for purposes of this

a complete list of any confidentiality agreements with Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with
respect to such Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal
(other than agreements that have expired by their terms).

  

(c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours, after any officer or director of Seller or of the Company knowingly

information or inquiry which could

       

reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, Seller shall
advise Buyer in writing as to the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and provide a
copy of all written materials provided in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.  After receipt of the Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, Seller shall continue to promptly keep Buyer informed in
all material respects of the status and details (including notice of all
material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and shall as promptly as practicable provide to
Buyer a copy of all written materials subsequently provided in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

  

Section 5.4 _Employment Matters_

  

(a) Upon the Closing Date, Buyer shall employ, or shall cause the Company or
any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company to employ or continue to employ,
all individuals who are employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date, including employees not actively at work due to injury,
vacation, military duty, disability or other leave of absence (the "
_Affected Employees_ "). During the period commencing with the Closing Date
and ending on December 31, 2007, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause
the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer or the Company to provide, base salary
(or regular wages) to each Affected Employee who continues to be employed by
Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company, that is not less
than the base salary (or regular wages) provided to such Affected Employee by
the Company immediately prior to the Closing.  During the period commencing
with the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007, Buyer shall provide,
or shall cause the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer or the Company to
provide, employee benefits to each Affected Employee who continues to be
employed by Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company, that
are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer. Periods of employment with the Company
or its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any current or former
Affiliate of the Company or any predecessor, to the extent previously
recognized under the Company Plans), shall be taken into account for purposes
of determining, as applicable, the eligibility for participation and vesting
of any Affected Employee under all employee benefit plans offered by Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer to the Affected Employees, including vacation plans or
arrangements, 401(k) or other retirement plans and any severance or welfare
plans. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) reduce any
period of limitation on medical coverage of Affected Employees due to pre-
existing conditions under the applicable medical plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer by the number of days of an individuals "creditable
coverage," to the extent required by Section 701 of ERISA, and (ii) credit
each Affected Employee with all deductible payments and co-payments paid by
such employee under the medical employee benefit plan of the Company or
its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the
Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has
reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer for such year. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer
upon any Affected Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of
Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Buyer, the Company or any
Affiliate of Buyer or the Company, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Affected
Employee at

       

any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Buyer, the
Company or any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company and the Affected Employee.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
withdraw, effective as of the Closing Date, from any Company Plan not
sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries, in the manner, if any, that
such Company Plan specifies for withdrawal of a participating employer.

  

(c) Notwithstanding the general provisions of _Section 5.4(a)_ , in the event
of an Affected Employees termination of employment without cause by Buyer,
the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer or the Company during the period
commencing with the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007, Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause the Company or other Affiliate of Buyer employing
such Affected Employee to provide, cash severance to such Affected Employee
in an aggregate amount not less than the base salary (or regular wages), as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing, that would otherwise have been
paid to such Affected Employee with respect to the period beginning on the
first day following the Affected Employees termination of employment and
ending on December 31, 2007; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall
an Affected Employee be entitled to receive any severance benefits in
connection with a termination of employment unless and until the Affected
Employee executes and returns to the Company a general release of claims
against Buyer, the Company and its Affiliates and successors and such release
of claims becomes effective and irrevocable; _provided_   _further_ , that in
no event shall an Affected Employee be entitled to receive any severance
benefits in connection with a termination of employment where there is a
simultaneous reemployment or continuing employment of the Affected Employee
by Buyer, the Company or an Affiliate of Buyer or the Company. If an Affected
Employee becomes entitled to severance benefits under any other severance
plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyer, the Company or an Affiliate
of Buyer or the Company, the severance benefits to which the Affected
Employee will become entitled shall not be less than the benefits described
in this _Section 5.4(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
any such Affected Employee also be entitled to receive the severance benefits
described in this _Section 5.4(c)_.

  

(d) Unless Buyer requests otherwise in writing, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective as of at least three
Business Days __ prior to the Closing Date, the Slough Estates USA Inc.
401(k) Retirement Plan and the Slough Estates USA Inc. Money Purchase Pension
Plan (each, a " _Qualified Plan_ "). At least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer (i) executed resolutions
of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing the termination of
each Qualified Plan, and (ii) an executed copy of each amendment made to a
Qualified Plan in connection with the termination of such plan.

  

(e) The Company shall, not less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, provide Buyer (i) executed resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company terminating the Executive Retirement Plan, effective
as of a date not later than the Closing Date, and (ii) an executed copy of
each amendment made to the Executive Retirement Plan in connection with the
termination of such plan. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, prior to the Closing Date, establish a "rabbi trust"
(the " _Rabbi Trust_ ")

       

pursuant to Section 3.08 of the Executive Retirement Plan and contribute to
the Rabbi Trust a cash amount equal to the Estimated Executive Retirement
Plan Settlement Amount; in the event the Rabbi Trust is not established
and/or funded prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to establish such Rabbi Trust and contribute to the Rabbi
Trust a cash amount equal to the Estimated Executive Retirement
Plan Settlement Amount as soon as practicable following the Closing Date. Not
later than December 15, 2007, Seller shall provide Buyer with specific
written instructions to purchase the Annuity, which written instructions
shall specify (i) the name of the insurer from whom the Annuity is to be
purchased, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Annuity (or a specimen
form of contract setting forth the terms and conditions of the Annuity).
Based upon such instructions, the Company shall cause the trustee of the
Rabbi Trust to purchase the Annuity using the funds of the Rabbi Trust (and
such additional funds of the Company as shall be necessary), and deliver the
Annuity to Marshall Lees on or after January 1, 2008 and on or before January
31, 2008 (except as may otherwise be required to comply with Section 409A of
the Code). To the extent the Annuity is purchased prior to January 1, 2008,
the trustee of the Rabbi Trust shall be the owner, payee and beneficiary of
the Annuity until delivery of the Annuity to Marshall Lees in accordance with
this _Section 5.4_ , at which time the trustee of the Rabbi Trust shall cause
Marshall Lees to become the owner, payee and beneficiary of the Annuity. If
and to the extent that (i) the sum of (A) the purchase price of the Annuity,
(B) the amount of any tax gross-up payment made pursuant to Section 3.09 of
the Executive Retirement Plan, and (C) all amounts paid by the Company
following the Closing in respect of the Executive Retirement Plan or the
Rabbi Trust (collectively, the " _Pension-Related Amounts_ "), exceeds (ii)
the Estimated Executive Retirement Plan Settlement Amount, then Seller shall
remit an amount equal to such excess to Buyer not later than seven (7)
Business Days following the delivery of the Annuity to Marshall Lees. If and
to the extent that (x) the Estimated Executive Retirement Plan Settlement
Amount exceeds the Pension-Related Amounts, then Buyer shall remit an amount
equal to such excess to Seller not later than seven (7) Business Days
following the delivery of the Annuity to Marshall Lees.

  

(f) Unless Buyer requests otherwise in writing, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate, effective as of the Closing, each medical and
dental benefit plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Health Plan_ "). At the Closing, the
Company shall provide Buyer with documentation evidencing the termination of
each Health Plan.

  

(g) Effective as of the date hereof, the Company and Marshall Lees shall
enter into a full and final settlement and general release of claims against
the Company and its Affiliates and each of their successors and affiliates
(the " _Settlement Agreement_ ") with respect to any and all liabilities and
obligations of the Company and its Affiliates and successors under the Lees
Employment Agreement, the Lees Retention Letter and the Executive Retirement
Plan. The Settlement Agreement is attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

  

(h) (i) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 5.4(h)_ , Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates, the Remuneration Committee and the
Trustees not to, grant or provide any payment or benefit (including, without
limitation, any future payment or benefit) to any Affected Employee on or
after the Closing Date. Except as expressly provided in this _Section
5.4(h)_ , on and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates, the Remuneration Committee and the Trustees not to, exercise
any right to determine the amount or

       

kind of payment or benefit to any Affected Employee (including, without
limitation, the amount or kind of any payment or benefit under any of the
Executive Plans).

  

(ii) Seller shall cause the Remuneration Committee, not less than seven (7)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to exercise its discretion to
determine the amount of the "special bonus" to be paid by the Company to
Marshall Lees upon (and subject to) the sale of the Company, as described in
the Lees Retention Letter. The amount of the bonus, once determined, shall
be disclosed to Marshall Lees and Buyer not less than seven (7) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.  The bonus shall be paid by the Company to
Marshall Lees not later than twenty (20) Business Days following the Closing
Date.

  

(iii) Seller shall, not less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, deliver the following documents to Buyer: (A) a letter from the
Trustees confirming that, subject to Closing and Marshall Lees continuing in
employment with the Company until Closing, the Trustees shall exercise their
discretion to release on the Closing Date to Marshall Lees all the shares of
Seller that are subject to the Lees LTIP Awards; and (B) a letter from the
Trustees confirming (1) that the Trustees shall, on or before the Closing
Date, exercise their discretion to determine that the Rohner LTIP Awards and
the Bergschneider LTIP Awards will not lapse by reason of the Closing, but
these awards will continue subject to the rules of the LTIP, and (2) that in
respect of each such award, on the third (3rd) anniversary of the grant of
the award, the Trustees shall determine whether and to what extent the
performance targets relating to such award have been met in accordance with
the terms and conditions of such awards and the LTIP and whether and to what
extent to release shares under such awards to Randy Rohner or Jonathan
Bergschneider, as appropriate.

  

(iv) In respect of the option granted to Randy Rohner over 27,308 shares in
Seller granted under the 2002 Plan, Seller shall determine in 2008 whether
and to what extent the performance targets relating to such option have been
met in accordance with the terms and conditions of such option and the 2002
Plan.

  

(v) Seller shall recommend to the Trustees, not less than seven (7) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, that the Trustees grant the New Awards prior
to the Closing Date and, if the New Awards are granted, the Seller shall, on
or before the Closing Date, disclose to the Buyer the number of shares under
the New Awards and the terms and conditions of the New Awards.

  

(vi) Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, the Remuneration Committee
and the Trustees to, administer all Executive Awards in accordance with the
applicable plan rules and (except as expressly stated in this _Section
5.4(h)(iii)(A), (B)(1) and (v)_ ) Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates, the Remuneration Committee and the Trustees not to, provide any
concession or relaxation of the rules or exercise any discretion with respect
to the Executive Awards unless the same concession, relaxation or exercise
of discretion applies generally to all other similar awards made to employees
of Seller or its Affiliates.

       

(vii) Seller shall take, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Trustees to
take, all actions necessary to satisfy (A) any and all tax withholding
obligations, and (B) any and all reporting obligations to the extent such
reporting obligations are the responsibility of the Seller, its Affiliates or
the Trustees, with respect to all compensation and benefits provided by
Seller, its Affiliates or the Trustees to any Affected Employee (including,
without limitation, compensation or benefits provided on or after the Closing
Date by Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Executive Awards), and
all employment taxes in respect thereof. Buyer shall, on request by Seller,
provide Seller with the information available to Buyer that is reasonably
necessary for the Seller, its Affiliates or the Trustees, to withhold,
collect and remit the appropriate amount of tax to be withheld by Seller, its
Affiliates or the Trustees, and to comply with any reporting obligations
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(h)(vii)_.

  

(i) This  _Section 5.4_ shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights
in any Affected Employee, or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or
benefits that may be provided to any Affected Employee by Buyer, the Company
or any of their Subsidiaries.

  

Section 5.5 _Publicity_

  

. Buyer and Seller agree to communicate with each other and cooperate with
each other prior to any public disclosure of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Buyer and Seller agree that no public release or announcement
concerning the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
by any party without the prior consent of Buyer and Seller, except (i) as
such release or announcement, upon the advice of outside counsel, may be
required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which
the securities of Seller or Buyer are listed (including the Circular),
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement, to
the extent practicable, shall allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance and (ii)
each of Seller and Buyer may disclose any information concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby that it deems appropriate in its respective
reasonable judgment, in light of its status as a publicly owned company,
including, without limitation, to securities analysts and institutional
investors, in press interviews and Governmental Filings.

  

Section 5.6 _Confidentiality_

  

(a) Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall treat
all Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
by reference into this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate only in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the
Company. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect as provided in _Section 7.3_ hereof in accordance with its terms.

       

(b) Except as otherwise provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, from and
after the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives not to, disclose to any other Person any
Company Confidential Information; _provided_ , that Seller may disclose
Company Confidential Information (i) to the extent required by Law, in any
report, statement, testimony or other submission to any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over Seller or (ii) in order to comply with any Law
applicable to Seller, or in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal
process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to Seller in the
course of any litigation, investigation or administrative proceeding;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if Seller or any of its Affiliates becomes
legally compelled by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any Company Confidential Information, Seller shall
provide Buyer with prompt prior written notice of such requirement to the
extent legally permissible, and, to the extent reasonably practicable,
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and Buyers Affiliates (at Buyers expense)
to obtain a protective order or similar remedy to cause Company Confidential
Information not to be disclosed, including interposing all available
objections thereto, such as objections based on settlement privilege. In the
event that such protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained,
Seller shall furnish only that portion of Company Confidential Information
that has been legally compelled. Seller hereby agrees to, and shall cause
its Affiliates to , protect Company Confidential Information by using the
same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent
the unauthorized disclosure of such Company Confidential Information
as Seller uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature.

  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, from and
after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives not to, disclose to any other Person any
Seller Confidential Information; _provided_ , that Buyer may disclose
Seller Confidential Information (i) to the extent required by Law, in any
report, statement, testimony or other submission to any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over Buyer or (ii) in order to comply with any Law
applicable to Buyer, or in response to any summons, subpoena or other legal
process or formal or informal investigative demand issued to Buyer in the
course of any litigation, investigation or administrative proceeding;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if Buyer or any of its Affiliates becomes
legally compelled by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar judicial or administrative
process to disclose any Seller Confidential Information, Buyer shall provide
Seller with prompt prior written notice of such requirement to the extent
legally permissible, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, reasonably
cooperate with Seller and Sellers Affiliates (at Sellers expense) to obtain
a protective order or similar remedy to cause Seller Confidential Information
not to be disclosed, including interposing all available objections thereto,
such as objections based on settlement privilege. In the event that such
protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained, Buyer shall furnish
only that portion of Seller Confidential Information that has been legally
compelled. Buyer hereby agrees to, and shall cause its Affiliates to, protect
Seller Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less
than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of
such Seller Confidential Information as Buyer uses to protect its own
confidential information of a like nature.

       

(d) Seller Confidential Information and Company Confidential Information, as
applicable, will not include information which (i) becomes available to the
public through no fault or negligence of the applicable party, (ii) was
already rightfully known to the applicable party (other than by previous
disclosure by the other party) as of the date hereof and not subject to any
duty of confidentiality, (iii) is independently developed by such party
without reference to any Confidential Information of the other party, or (iv)
after the date hereof, is lawfully and in good faith made available or known
to such party by a Person not connected with Seller or Buyer or their
respective Representatives and without an obligation of confidence to such
party, directly or indirectly.

  

Section 5.7 _Access to Information_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, afford the Representatives of Buyer reasonable access
upon reasonable advance notice and normal business hours to the officers,
directors, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their books and records, and shall furnish
Buyer with such financial, operating and other data and information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Buyer, through its
Representatives, may reasonably request.  In exercising its rights hereunder,
Buyer shall conduct itself so as not to interfere in the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to Closing. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that any contact by Buyer and its Representatives
with Representatives or customers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
hereunder shall be arranged and supervised by representatives of Seller,
unless Seller otherwise expressly consents with respect to any specific
contact.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) nor their respective Representatives shall be required
to disclose to Buyer or any Representatives any (i) information (A) relating
to any sale or divestiture process conducted by Seller or its Affiliates for
the Company or its business or Sellers or its Affiliates (or
their Representatives) evaluation of the Company or its business in
connection therewith, including projections, financial or other information
relating thereto, other than with respect to a Person who makes an
Acquisition Proposal, as provided in _Section 5.3_ , after the date hereof or
(B) if doing so could violate any fiduciary duty of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or any Contract or
Law to which Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) is a party or is subject or which it believes in good faith
could result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
privilege (including, without limitation, the attorney-client and work
product privileges) or (ii) consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax
Return of which Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) is the common parent or any other information
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns other than information relating solely to
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

Section 5.8 _Maintenance of Books and Records_

  

(a)  Each party hereto shall preserve, until at least the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing Date records possessed or to
be possessed by such party relating to the Company or it Subsidiaries.
After the Closing Date and up until at least the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, upon any reasonable request from a party hereto or its
Representatives, the party holding such records shall (i) provide to the
requesting party or its Representatives reasonable access to such records
during normal business hours and

   

49  

   

(ii) permit the requesting party or its Representatives to make copies of
such records, in each case at no cost to the requesting party or its
Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Such
records may be sought under this _Section 5.8_ for any reasonable
purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection with the
audit, accounting, litigation, federal securities disclosure or other similar
needs of the party seeking such records.

  

(b) From and after the Closing, the parties shall use reasonable efforts to
make available to each other, upon written request, their respective
Representatives for fact finding, consultation and interviews and as
witnesses to the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required in
connection with any Action in which the requesting party may from time to
time be involved relating to the Company, Seller or their Affiliates
businesses as such business was conducted prior to the Closing. Except as
otherwise agreed between the parties, Seller and Buyer agree to reimburse
each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the other in
connection with providing individuals and witnesses pursuant to this _Section
5.8(a)_.

  

Section 5.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to
do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other party
hereto in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited
to: (i) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of
any of the parties hereto; (ii) the obtaining of applicable consents, waivers
or approvals of any third parties or as required under applicable Law; (iii)
the defending of any Action, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the performance of the obligations hereunder; (iv) the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other
actions as the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry
out the intent of this Agreement; (v) the taking of such actions as Buyer may
reasonably require in order to protect Buyers Tax status as a real estate
investment trust; (vi) comply promptly with all requirements which applicable
Laws may impose on Seller and its Subsidiaries with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (vii) effect all necessary
registrations, filings and submissions of information required
by Governmental Entities from Seller or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the others of any communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and any
of the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party or Affiliate thereof
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from
any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

  

Section 5.10 _Insurance_. Buyer acknowledges that all insurance coverage for
the Company and its Subsidiaries under policies of Seller and its Affiliates,
other

        

than policies owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any
policies relating to environmental matters or Environmental Claims, as set
forth in _Section 5.21)_ , shall terminate as of the Closing and, following
the Closing, no claims may be brought against any policy of Seller and its
Affiliates, other than policies owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
respect the Company or its Subsidiaries regardless of whether the events
underlying such claim arose prior to, at or after the Closing.

  

Section 5.11 _Repayment of Closing Indebtedness_. On the Closing Date, Buyer
or its Affiliates shall loan to the Company the aggregate amount of cash
necessary to prepay the Closing Indebtedness amounts that remain outstanding
as of the Closing Date in accordance with the agreements governing the
Closing Indebtedness, including the payment of all the Repayment Premiums in
connection therewith (the " _Closing Indebtedness Loan_ "). At least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall
cooperate in preparation of a "funds flow memorandum" that details the
procedures for the Companys repayment of the Closing Indebtedness, including
the related Repayment Premiums, on the Closing Date (the " _Funds Flow Memo_
"). After the Companys receipt of the Closing Indebtedness Loan, Seller
shall cause the Company to repay the Closing Indebtedness amounts that remain
outstanding as of the Closing in accordance with the agreements governing
such Closing Indebtedness, including the related Repayment Premiums, in
compliance with the Funds Flow Memo (such repayment, the " _Closing
Indebtedness Repayment_ ").  For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company,
Seller or their Affiliates shall be obligated to repay the Other Company
Indebtedness on the Closing Date.

  

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_

  

(a) _Pre-Closing Period Taxes_

  

(i) _Indemnification for Pre-Closing Period Taxes_. From and after the
Closing Date, Seller (for purposes of this Section 5.12 only, the " _Tax
Indemnifying Party_ "), shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Buyer and the Company for, all Taxes of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are attributable or allocable to a Pre-Closing
Period, except to the extent such Taxes are both (A) reflected in the Closing
Balance Sheet as an accrued and payable Tax liability or in the reserve for
such a Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face
of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and (B) included in the calculation of the
Final Net Assets. For purposes of determining the Tax Indemnifying Partys
indemnity obligation under section 5.12, and to the extent applicable,
Sections 5.25 and 8.2, Taxes attributable or allocable to Pre-Closing Periods
shall be determined without regard to any reduction in the Tax liability or
increase in the Tax credit of the Company or its Subsidiaries for such
periods attributable to the repayment of the Closing Indebtedness, including
the payment of Repayment Premiums.

  

(ii) _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of this _Section 5.12_ , in
order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to any taxable year or
period that includes an Interim Period, the parties hereto shall, to the
extent permitted under

        

applicable Law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to treat for all
purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of
the Company. In any case where applicable Law does not permit the Company to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, then,
in each such case, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion
of the Interim Period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (A) in the case of
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the
Closing Date; and (B) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (A)
above that are imposed on a periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Interim Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant period. In all
cases, any transaction that occurs on the Closing Date and after the
effective time of the Closing shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as having occurred on the next succeeding day.

  

(b) _Tax Refunds_

  

(i) Buyer shall pay to Seller all refunds or credits of Taxes received by
Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and
attributable to Taxes paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor thereof) with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, net of any Taxes
imposed on such refund amount, and adjusted to reflect any Tax benefit
actually received by Buyer or the Company in connection with the accrual or
payment of amounts pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_ , to the extent that
such refund or credit was not reflected in the Final Net Assets Adjustment
contemplated by _Section 2.3_. For purposes of the foregoing, the Buyer or
the Company will be deemed to have actually received a tax benefit to the
extent that the amount of Taxes payable by the Buyer or the Company, as the
case may be, as shown on such Persons Tax Return for the year of the accrual
or payment of amounts pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_ or an earlier year
is reduced below the amount of Taxes that such Person would have been
required to pay in such year but for the deduction attributable to
the accrual or payment of amounts pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_.

  

(ii) _Company REIT Election_. The Company shall not, and Buyer shall not
cause or permit the Company to, elect to be taxed as a REIT with respect to
its 2006 taxable year.  If the Company files an election to be taxed as a
REIT with respect to its 2007 taxable year, then the Net REIT Tax Amount
shall be treated for purposes of _Section 5.12(b)_ as having been refunded to
the Company after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall pay Seller the Net REIT
Tax Amount upon the filing of the REIT election.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to Taxes paid or treated as having been paid such
amounts shall not be payable by Buyer to Seller prior to the receipt of the
refund of such amounts by the Company. For purposes of the foregoing, the "
_Net REIT Tax Amount_ " is an amount equal to (A) the amount of all Taxes
paid, treated as having been paid, or otherwise reflected in the
determination of Final Net Assets with respect to the 2007 taxable year, and
which would not be payable if the Company elects to be taxed as a REIT for
such taxable year, reduced, but not below zero, by (B) the amount of any

        

withholding Tax obligations imposed on the Company in connection with
distributions made by the Company on or prior to the Closing (a " _Pre-
Closing Distribution_ ") as a result of the Companys election to be taxed as
a REIT. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and in each
case, only to the extent caused by the Companys election to be taxed as a
REIT for its 2007 taxable year: (A) Seller shall not indemnify the Company or
Buyer for any withholding Taxes imposed on the Company to the extent such
withholding Taxes are attributable to a Pre-Closing Distribution made to
Seller; (B) the imposition of such withholding Taxes shall not be treated as
a breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant set forth in this
Agreement; (C) the Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, (x)
duly and timely file any and all Tax Returns required to be filed
with respect to any such withholding Tax, and (y) pay over to the appropriate
Tax authority the amount of any such withholding Tax; and (D) Buyer shall
indemnify Seller, on a fully grossed up after Tax basis, from and against any
and all Taxes imposed on Buyer by any such Tax authority with respect to any
such withholding Tax.

  

(c) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_

  

(i) Seller shall prepare and timely file or cause the Company to prepare and
timely file (including extensions) all Tax Returns with respect to the
Company for any Pre-Closing Period to the extent such Tax Returns are
required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay or cause
to be paid all Taxes reflected thereon. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent, in all material respects,
with the prior practice of the Company (including, without limitation, prior
Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the
Company), except as required by a change in the applicable Law or regulations
or as consented to by Buyer.  Seller shall deliver all such Tax Returns to
Buyer for Buyers review at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of any such Tax Return and shall make such revisions
to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Buyer.

  

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file or cause the Company to prepare and
timely file (including extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed after
the Closing Date. Any such Tax Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Period
shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent, in all material
respects, with the prior practice of the Company (including prior Tax
elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the
Company), except as required by a change in the applicable Law or regulations
or as consented to by Seller.  Buyer shall deliver all such Tax Returns with
respect to Pre-Closing Periods to Seller for Sellers review and approval at
least twenty (20) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any
such Tax Return; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer may cause the Company
to elect to be treated as a REIT on any such Tax Return; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, in any such case, Buyer shall be subject to, among other
things, the tax refund provision of _Section 5.12(b)_. If Seller disputes
any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify Buyer of such disputed item (or
items) and the basis for its objection. The parties shall act in good faith
to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the Tax Return is
required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question shall be resolved by an

        

independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer. The fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer.  No later than five (5) days prior to the due date thereof, Seller
shall pay to Buyer that amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which
relates to Pre-Closing Periods, except to the extent that such Taxes are both
(i) reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet as an accrued and payable Tax
liability or in the reserve for such a Tax liability (rather than any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) shown on the face of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and (ii)
included in the calculation of the Final Net Assets.  For purposes of the
preceding sentence, Taxes shall be allocated in the manner set forth in
_Section 5.12(a)(ii)_ hereof.

  

(d) _Tax Cooperation_

  

(i) For a period of seven (7) years from and after the Closing, Seller and
Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,
as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and
records), and assistance relating to the Company as is reasonably requested
for the filing of any Tax Returns including with respect to the Companys
compliance with the requirements for qualification as a REIT, if applicable,
for the preparation of any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding related to any proposed adjustment.
Any information obtained under this _Section 5.12(d)(i)_ shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or
other proceeding. After the expiration of such seven-year period, Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, may dispose of such information, books and
records, provided that prior to such disposition, (A) Seller shall give Buyer
the opportunity, at Buyers expense, to take possession of such information,
books and records held by Seller; and (B) Buyer shall give Seller the
opportunity, at Sellers expense, to take possession of such information,
books and records held by the Company.

  

(ii) Buyer and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller, amend any Tax Return (except as required by applicable Law), or waive
or extend any statute of limitations, if any such amendment, waiver, or
extension would (A) increase the amount of Taxes payable by Seller with
respect to its ownership of stock of the Company or any distribution or
payment made by the Company to Seller on or before the Closing Date, (B)
increase the Taxes of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Period, (C)
cause a representation or warranty of Seller to be untrue or (D) give rise to
an indemnification obligation of Seller under any provision of this
Agreement.

  

(iii) Prior to the Closing Date, at the Buyers request, Seller shall
cooperate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the Buyer in
determining whether the Company satisfies the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT with respect to its 2007 taxable year.
Such cooperation shall include providing any information reasonably requested
by Buyer regarding the income and assets of the Company and distributions
made by the Company in any Pre-Closing Period.

        

(e) _Tax Contests_

  

(i) After the Closing, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (a " _Tax Notice_
") of any demand or claim received by Buyer or the Company from any Tax
authority or any other party with respect to Taxes for which the Tax
Indemnifying Party is liable pursuant to _Section 5.12_ or _Article VIII_
within ten (10) days of the receipt of such demand or claim by Buyer or the
Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a failure to give such Tax Notice
will not affect the rights of Buyer or the Company to indemnification under
_Section 5.12_ or _Article VIII_ unless, or except to the extent that, such
failure materially impairs the ability of the Tax Indemnifying Party to
contest such demand or claim. Such Tax Notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any Tax authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability.

  

(ii) Subject to the following sentence, Seller may elect to control the
conduct, through counsel chosen by Seller and at Sellers own expense, of any
audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial proceeding involving
any asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought
under _Section 5.12_  or _Article VIII_ , including any contest in respect of
an Interim Period (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding relating
to an asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as a " _Contest_ "). If
Seller elects to control a Contest, Seller shall within thirty (30) calendar
days of receipt of the Tax Notice notify Buyer in writing of its intent to do
so; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer and the Company are authorized to
file any motion, answer or other pleading that may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to protect their interests during such thirty (30) day period;
_provided_ _further_  that the Buyer may retain separate counsel and
participate in the defense of such Contest. Buyer shall cooperate and shall
cause the Company (and any of its successors) to cooperate in each phase of
such Contest. Seller shall keep the Buyer informed regarding the status of
such Contest. If Seller does not elect to control the Contest, Buyer or the
Company may, without affecting its or any other indemnified partys rights to
indemnification under this _Article V_ or _Article VIII_ , assume and
control the defense of such Contest with participation by Seller.

  

(iii) In the event that a Contest involves both a Pre-Closing Period and a
Post-Closing Period (a " _Straddle Contest_ "), the parties shall endeavor to
cause the Contest proceeding to be separated into two or more separate
proceedings, each of which involves exclusively Pre-Closing Periods or Post-
Closing Periods. In the event that such separation cannot, after diligent
efforts, be achieved, Buyer and Seller shall jointly control the Straddle
Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to this _Section 5.12(e)_
generally, Buyer shall have all rights to make decisions, settle, compromise
and/or concede such asserted liability as relates to a Post-Closing Period.
To the extent Seller controls all or a portion of any Contest, Seller shall
keep the Buyer informed regarding the status of such Contest.

  

(iv) With respect to a Contest that is described in paragraphs (ii) or (iii)
of this  _Section 5.12_ , Sellers ability to settle, compromise and/or
concede any asserted Tax liability shall be subject to Buyers consent, not
to be unreasonably withheld,

        

conditioned or delayed, if Sellers proposed settlement, compromise or
concession could adversely affect a Tax liability of Buyer or the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , if Buyer does not provide Seller with such consent,
and Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount that Seller was willing to pay the
Tax authority, and the Tax Authority was willing to accept, to settle the
asserted Tax liability, Seller shall be released by Buyer from all
indemnification obligations with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 5.12_
and _Article VIII_ and Buyer shall assume control over the conduct of such
Contest and shall have all rights if such Contest does not involve any issues
for which Seller remains liable under this _Section 5.12_ to make decisions,
settle, compromise, and/or concede such asserted liability.

  

(f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payment_.  The parties agree to treat
any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by Law.

  

(g) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreements or arrangements
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or may have any
liability or obligation shall be terminated effective as of the Closing.

relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods.

of doubt, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
(including this _Section 5.12_ and _Article VIII_ ): (i) Seller makes no
representation or warranty concerning the ability of the Company to qualify
as a REIT for any taxable year; and (ii) Seller shall not be liable to Buyer
for, and shall not indemnify Buyer against, any Taxes, losses, or other
Damages incurred by the Company, Buyer, or any of their Affiliates to the
extent such Damages are attributable to (A) the inability of the Company to
make a valid election to be taxed as a REIT for any taxable year, (B) the
effect of the Companys Tax status on the ability of Buyer or any Affiliate
to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year or (C) any income or gain
attributable to a Section 1031 transaction or installment obligation open at
the time of the Closing, but only to the extent that the right to receive
such payment was not included in the calculation of Final Net Assets.

  

Section 5.13 _Buyer s Financing Activities_

  

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller and its Affiliates have no
responsibility for any financing that Buyer may raise in connection with the

documents prepared by or on behalf of or utilized by Buyer or its Affiliates,
or Buyers financing sources, in connection with Buyers financing activities
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, that include any
information provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries), including any offering memorandum, bankers
book or similar document used, or

        

any other written offering materials used (collectively, " _Offering

such Buyer financing shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect
that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor any employees thereof have
any responsibility for the content of such document and disclaim all
responsibility therefor and shall further include a disclaimer with respect
to Seller and its Affiliates in any oral disclosure with respect to such
financing.

  

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Financing and the
Financing Commitments, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements with
respect to the Financing, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly
as practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date and (iii)
consummate the Financing at or prior to Closing. Buyer shall provide to
Seller copies of all final documents relating to the Financing and shall keep
Seller reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the
financing process relating thereto.  Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not
agree to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the
Financing Commitments or other final documentation relating to the Financing
without the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), except as otherwise permitted under _Section
5.13(d)_.  In the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date, upon
request of Buyer, Seller shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to

reasonably cooperate with Buyer in connection with the Financing, including
without limitation, subject to _Section 5.13(a)_ , (i) preparation of all
required financial statements relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries

participation in meetings and road shows, if any; (iii) the provision of
information relating to the Financing reasonably requested by Buyer; and (iv)

Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives in connection with such cooperation.

  

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Buyer to
satisfy its obligations under _Section 5.13(b)_ , any of the Financing or the
Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing agreement relating
thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part,
for any reason, Buyer shall (i) promptly notify Seller of such expiration or
termination and the reasons therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
promptly to arrange for alternative financing (which shall be in an amount
sufficient to pay the Required Amounts from other sources and which do not
include any conditions of such alternative financing that are more onerous
than or in addition to the conditions set forth in the Financing) to replace
the financing contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments or
agreements.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.13(b)_ ,
at any time Buyer may replace the Financing with alternative financing
arrangements which (i) provide Buyer with sufficient funds to pay the
Required Amounts prior to or concurrent with the Closing, (ii) are no less
favorable to the Seller than the Financing and (iii) do

        

not prevent or materially impair or delay the Closing (the " _Financing
Alternative_ "). In the event Buyer replaces the Financing with any Financing
Alternative, the terms of _Section 5.13(b)_ shall no longer apply with
respect to the Financing, but shall thereafter apply with respect to the
Financing Alternative.

  

Section 5.14 _Resignations_. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts
to obtain the written resignations of each director or manager, as
applicable, and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on

(a) No later than twenty (20) Business Days following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to change their names and cause
the certificate of incorporation (or equivalent organizational document),
as applicable, to be amended to remove any reference to "Slough", "SEGRO"
or "Slough Estates" or any other name, trademark or service mark used by
Seller or any of its Affiliates. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than sixty (60) Business Days following the Closing Date, cease
to (i) make any use of any names, trademarks, or service marks that include
the terms (A) "Slough", "SEGRO" or "Slough Estates," or any other name,
trademark or service mark used by Seller or any of its Affiliates as of the
date hereof and (B) any names, trademarks, or service marks containing or
comprising the foregoing, including any names, trademarks, or service marks
confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof (the " _Slough Marks_ "), and
(ii) hold themselves out as having any affiliation with Seller or any of its
Affiliates, other than non-prominent textual references solely to the extent
reasonably necessary to make factual reference that such entity is
a successor in interest as owner of the Company.  In furtherance thereof, as
soon as practicable but in no event later than sixty (60) Business Days
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates, the
Company and its Subsidiaries to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate
all Slough Marks from all assets and other materials owned by the Company and
its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, any business cards,
schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional
materials, manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and other
materials and systems. Any use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any of the Slough Marks as permitted in this _Section 5.15_ is subject to
their compliance with the quality control requirements and guidelines in
effect for the Slough Marks as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all uses of the Slough Marks by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
existence as of the Closing Date shall be deemed in compliance with such
quality control requirements and guidelines. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not use the Slough Marks in a manner that may reflect negatively on such name
and marks or on Seller or its Affiliates.  Buyer and its Affiliates shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any of its Affiliates for any Damages
relating to or arising from the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the
Slough Marks pursuant to this _Section 5.15_.

  

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Seller or
its Affiliates will provide, or will cause to be provided, forwarding of all
e-mail directed to any Affected Employee at the "sloughusa.com" domain name
to such employees new e-mail address (as specified by in writing by Buyer at
or prior to the Closing or to such other e-mail

        

address as Buyer may reasonably request from time to time thereafter). Upon
Buyers reasonable request, Seller or its Affiliates also will provide, or
cause to be provided, an automated e-mail response instructing the sending
party to use the applicable employees new e-mail address (or such other
e-mail address as Buyer may reasonably request).

  

Section 5.16 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the Closing, Buyer and
Seller promptly shall notify each other in writing of any fact, change,
condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which

efforts to obtain the release of Seller or its Affiliates that are a party to
each of the guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds and other similar
agreements listed in  _Section 5.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the
" _Guarantees_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the beneficiary of each of the Guarantees,
effective as of the Closing, to accept a substitute guarantee as may be
requested by the beneficiary of each such Guarantee. In the event any of the
Guarantees are not released prior to or at the Closing, Buyer will indemnify
and hold Seller and its Affiliates that are a party to each such Guarantee
harmless for any and all payments required to be made under, and costs and
expenses incurred in connection with, such Guarantee by Seller or its
Affiliates that are a party to such Guarantee until such Guarantee is
released.

  

(b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain the release of the Company, Buyer and their Affiliates from
each of the guarantees, performance bonds, bid bonds and other similar
agreements related to agreements or obligations of Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Company) that will remain effective after the Closing (the "
_Released Guarantees_ "). In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the beneficiary of each of the Released
Guarantees, effective as of the Closing, to accept a substitute guarantee as
may be requested by the beneficiary of each such Released Guarantee, which
substitute guarantee shall not include the Company, Buyer or their Affiliates
as a party.  In the event any of the Released Guarantees are not released
prior to or at the Closing, Seller will indemnify and hold Buyer and its
Affiliates harmless for any and all payments required to be made under, and
costs and expenses incurred in connection with, such Released Guarantee by
the Company, Buyer or their Affiliates until such Released Guarantee is

(i) the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
effect on the date of this

transactions contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect and be
honored by the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing.

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
Buyer, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.18_.

  

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 5.18_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this _Section 5.18_ applies without the express written consent of
such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.18_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.18_ ).

counsel, to issue a policy of title insurance or a date down endorsement for
any Company Title Insurance Policy or other customary evidence of title
assurance, as appropriate for the respective jurisdiction, showing good and
indefeasible title to the Company Properties in fee simple vested in the
applicable entity as of the Closing Date (each such policy or date down
endorsement or other customary evidence of title assurance, as appropriate
for the respective jurisdiction, a " _New Title Policy_ " and collectively
the " _New Title Policies_ ") and Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer (at no out-of-pocket
cost or expense to Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable) in
any efforts relating to the removal from the New Title Policies of any
Encumbrances. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, reasonably cooperate with the Buyer if Buyer, in its sole and absolute
discretion, determines to request from one or more land surveyors a new ALTA
survey, or an update or recertification of any existing survey with respect
to any Company Property, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer (the "
_New Surveys_ "). Prior to or at the Closing Date, and conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company and any Subsidiary
to execute and deliver to the applicable title insurance companies, so-called
ALTA Statements or similar title affidavits (which shall include customary
indemnification by the Company and any such Subsidiary) in form and substance
as are reasonably acceptable to Buyer and reasonably required by such title

seek and obtain subordination and attornment agreements and/or estoppel or
similar statements (and addressing such factual matters as reasonably
determined by Buyer) from any tenants under any Company Leases or from the

(A) acquire any Person or assets (a " _Target Business_ ") (and thereafter
own, manage, operate and control the Target Business) that includes a
Competitive Business if (1) such Target Business does not at any time from

lease greater than 1,250,000 square feet of life science, laboratory and
biomedical-related properties and (2) Seller has not previously acquired
during the Non-Compete Period one or more Target Businesses that own or lease
an aggregate of greater than 2,500,000 square feet of life science,
laboratory and biomedical-related properties; and

  

(B) acquire any Target Business (and thereafter, subject to Sellers
divestiture obligations set forth below, own, manage, operate

        

and control the Target Business) that includes a Competitive Business that
owns or leases between 1,250,000 and 2,500,000 square feet of life science,

Section 5.25 _Alternate Transactions_

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until seven (7) Business Days prior to

one of the alternate transactions (the " _Holding Company Transaction_ " or
the " _Partnership Transaction_ " and, collectively, the " _Alternate
Transactions_ ") described in _Section 5.25(b)_ or _Section 5.25(c)_. Seller
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to reasonably

        

cooperate, with Buyer and its Representatives in (i) providing information in
its possession or control reasonably requested by Buyer in evaluating and
implementing the Alternate Transactions and (ii) reviewing the Alternate
Transactions to determine the impact of the implementation and consummation
thereof on the parties, including, without limitation, any potential delay of
the Closing and any additional costs, Taxes (including Incremental Taxes or
any withholding Taxes) or other Damages (including Incremental Damages)
expected to be incurred by Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with such
Alternate Transactions. Prior to the implementation of the
Alternate Transaction, Seller shall prepare in good faith and provide to
Buyer a schedule (the " _Alternate Transaction Schedule_ ") containing the
reasonably estimated amount and supporting calculations of the Incremental
Taxes and Incremental Damages associated with the selected Alternate
Transaction. If, following its review, Seller reasonably determines that the
implementation and consummation of the selected Alternate Transaction should
not result in any delay of the Closing in excess of Permitted Delay and any
additional material Taxes, out-of-pocket costs or other Damages to Seller,
its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates, or its shareholders in excess of any
additional amount Buyer agrees to pay to Seller or its Subsidiaries at the
closing of such Alternate Transaction, then:

  

(i) Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall, with Sellers and its Subsidiaries
reasonable cooperation, prepare all documents and filings (including, without
limitation, Tax elections and requests for guidance or clearances reasonably
requested by Buyer or Seller with respect to United Kingdom or United States
Taxes or foreign Tax credits applicable to the selected Alternate
Transaction) reasonably necessary to implement the selected Alternate
Transaction (including, if applicable, _Section_ _5.25(c)(vi)_ ), all of
which shall be submitted to Seller for its prior review and comment;

  

(ii) Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall promptly execute and,
if necessary, promptly deliver or file with a third party (including an
appropriate governmental or regulatory authority), such documents and
instruments as are prepared by Buyer pursuant to the foregoing clause (i),
delivered to Seller, which are reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
reasonably necessary to implement the Alternate Structure;

  

(iii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties
from, against and in respect of, and shall pay to the Seller Indemnified
Parties the amount of, any (A) Incremental Taxes and (B) Incremental Damages;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to such indemnification with respect to, and shall refund to Buyer
any amounts previously paid in respect of, any Incremental Taxes or
Incremental Damages resulting from an act or failure to act by a Seller
Indemnified Party which represents a breach of their duties under clause (ii)
above or from a failure to act in good faith regarding their obligations
under the introductory paragraph of _Section 5.25(a)_ or Sections
_5.25(a)(i)_ , _5.25(b)(v)_ ,  _5.25(g)_ , _5.25(h)_ or _5.25(j)_ , and (ii)
the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to Incremental Damages not reflected on the Alternate Transaction
Schedule unless the Alternate Transaction Schedule was completed in good
faith, it being understood that, so long as the Alternate Transaction
Schedule was completed in good faith, Buyer shall be required to indemnify
Seller Indemnified Parties

        

for all Incremental Damages, whether or not reflected on the Alternate
Transaction Schedule;

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, provided
Seller and its Subsidiaries comply with clause (ii) above and act in good
faith regarding their obligations under the introductory paragraph of
_Section 5.25(a)_  and _Sections 5.25(a)(i)_ , _5.25(b)(v)_ , _5.25(g)_ ,
_5.25(h)_  and _5.25(j)_ in order to implement the selected Alternate
Transaction, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement resulting from the implementation of
the Alternate Transaction may be alleged against any Seller Indemnified Party
and no Seller Indemnified Party shall have any liability in respect of such a
breach under any provision of this Agreement;

  

(v) The selected Alternate Transaction may be implemented in one or more
phases, effective (unless otherwise provided in this _Section 5.25_ , except
to the extent otherwise agreed by Seller and Buyer) at such times as
reasonably requested by Buyer, provided that the closing of any such phase
shall not occur more than three (3) Business Days prior to the expected
closing of the transactions described in _Section 5.25(b)(iv)_ or _Section
5.25(c)(v)_ , as applicable. In the event that Seller and Buyer take any
action reasonably necessary to implement the selected Alternate Transaction
and the Closing does not occur for any reason, the parties will, to the
extent possible, affect a rescission of such actions. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that Seller takes any action
reasonably necessary to implement the selected Alternate Transaction and the
Closing does not occur for any reason (other than a willful breach by a
Seller Indemnified Party that is intended to impair Buyers benefits under
this Agreement), then Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of, and shall pay to Seller
Indemnified Parties the amount of, any Damages (including Taxes) incurred by
them as a result of any such action or the unwinding of any such action; and

  

(vi) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer shall prepare
and submit to Seller a detailed outline of the steps and actions required to
be taken by Seller pursuant to clause (ii) above in order to implement the
selected Alternate Transaction. Prior to the implementation of the selected
Alternate Transaction, Buyer may revise such outline from time to time and
will promptly provide a copy of such revised outline to Seller.

  

(b) The " _Holding Company Transaction_ " shall refer to a transaction
substantially in the form of the following:

  

(i) Seller shall cause STE to form a new United States corporation ("
_Holdco_ ") and to contribute all of the Shares of the Company to Holdco in
exchange for common stock and preferred stock of Holdco with identical rights
to the outstanding common stock and preferred stock of the Company. Seller
shall take no action to cause Holdco to be taxed in any manner, with the
result that Holdco shall be treated as a domestic corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes.

   

64  

   

(ii) The Company shall convert to a limited liability company (the "
_Converted Entity_ ") that is treated or elects to be treated as an entity
that is disregarded as separate from Holdco for United States federal income
tax purposes.  Upon Buyers reasonable request, Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with respect to the conversion of Subsidiaries of the Company into
limited liability companies that are treated as entities that are disregarded
as separate from Holdco for United States federal income tax purposes.

  

(iii) The Converted Entity shall distribute its interest in the Charterhouse
Entities to Holdco.

  

(iv) Seller shall cause Holdco to sell to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase from
Holdco all of the membership interests of the Converted Entity for cash in an
amount equal to the Purchase Price in a manner consistent (to the extent
possible) with the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

  

(v) Holdco shall promptly use a portion of the net proceeds to redeem the
preferred stock issued by Holdco to STE and then distribute the balance of
such proceeds to STE as a dividend.

  

(c) The " _Partnership Transaction_ " shall refer to a transaction
substantially in the form of the following:

STE.

  

(iii) Seller shall cause STE to form a new United States corporation ("
_Newco_ ") and to contribute Shares constituting a 1% or less interest in the
Company to Newco in exchange for Newco stock.

  

(iv) The Company shall convert to a limited liability company (the "
_Partnership Converted Entity_ ") that shall not elect to be treated as a
corporation for United States Federal income tax purposes unless the Closing
does not occur.  Upon Buyers reasonable request, Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with respect to the conversion of Subsidiaries of the Company into
limited liability companies that are treated as entities that are disregarded
as separate from the Company for United States federal income tax purposes.

  

(v) Seller shall cause STE to sell to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase from STE
all of the stock of Newco and all of the membership interests of the
Partnership Converted Entity held by STE for cash in an amount equal to the
Purchase Price in a manner consistent (to the extent possible) with the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

        

(vi) If the Partnership Transaction is implemented but does not close, the
Charterhouse LLCs shall elect to be treated as corporations for United States
federal income tax purposes effective immediately prior to the distribution
in _Section_ _5.25(c)(ii)_ , and notwithstanding _Section 5.25(c)(iv)_ , the
Company shall elect to be treated as a corporation for United States federal
income tax purposes effective as of its conversion to a limited liability
company.

  

(d) Section 1031 Asset Acquisitions.

  

(i) Buyer may elect to acquire, in connection with the Closing, one or more
of the Companys Properties as part of a like-kind exchange under Section
1031 of the Code (such Company Properties thus acquired hereinafter referred
to as " _Replacement Properties_ "), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) the
value of the Replacement Properties shall not exceed $200,000,000 **** in
the aggregate, (B) any such like-kind exchange shall be consummated through
the use of a qualified intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder
(the " _Assignee_ "), and (C) no such Replacement Properties may  be subject
to any Encumbrance that requires a consent from any Person (other than Seller
and its Affiliates) in connection with any acquisition pursuant to this
_Section 5.25(d)_.

  

(ii) If Buyer elects to acquire any such Replacement Properties, it shall
notify Seller of such election in writing at least seven (7) Business Days
prior to the proposed Closing Date. Such notice shall be executed by an
executive officer of Buyer and shall specifically identify Assignee and the
Replacement Properties to be acquired. Following receipt of such notice,
Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer in attempting to close the
acquisition of the Replacement Properties on the second Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing, including executing such documents
and taking such actions as Buyer may reasonably request to complete the
acquisition of the Replacement Properties in a manner that does not result in
any incremental liabilities or obligations of any Seller Indemnified Party,
or in the case of the Holding Company Transaction, upon the request of Buyer,
to distribute such Replacement Properties to Holdco or STE respectively and
then transfer the Replacement Properties to the Assignee, prior to the sale
of Holdco to Buyer. Without limiting the generality of the immediately
preceding sentence, any Transfer Taxes, recording, registration and other
fees, charges, premiums and any similar Taxes shall be borne solely by Buyer
in connection with any such exchange, and Buyer shall guarantee the full and
timely performance by the Assignee of its obligations in respect to its
acquisition of Replacement Properties and in respect of each and every one of
the representations, warranties, indemnities, obligations and undertakings of
Buyer under this Agreement (and any amendments or modifications hereto) that
relate to the Replacement Properties. In connection with the closing of any
such acquisition of the Replacement Properties, Assignee shall transfer to
Seller or its designee an amount of cash equal to the aggregate estimated
fair market value of all such Replacement Properties as agreed to by Seller,
which amount shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the Initial Purchase
Price payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(i)_. The transactions contemplated
by this _Section 5.25(d)_ shall be treated as a selected Alternate
Transaction (if no Alternate Transaction is otherwise selected) or as a
component of the selected Alternate Transaction, and any transfer of one
or more Replacement Properties

        

by the Company to Buyer shall be subject to all of the provisions of _Section
5.25(a)_ , including clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) thereof. If one
or more Assignees acquire the Replacement Properties and the Closing
described in Article II does not occur as scheduled, then such acquisition
shall be rescinded by the parties as promptly as possible and in any event
with two Business Days (the " _Rescission_ ") with Buyer transferring (or
causing the Assignees to transfer) the Replacement Properties back to the
respective Subsidiary of the Company (the " _1031 Transferors_ ") from which
the Replacement Properties were acquired. In such event, no sale or transfer
shall have been deemed to occur with respect to the Replacement Properties.
Concurrently with consummation of the Rescission, any and all accounts,
payments or credits paid or received by Buyer or its Affiliates with respect
to the Replacement Properties shall be returned, paid or otherwise
transferred to the Buyer or the applicable 1031 Transferors (as applicable),
and Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of any
Damages (including Taxes) suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties in
connection with or as a result of the acquisition by Buyer or any Assignee of
the Replacement Properties and the Rescission; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties if
the Closing does not occur due to a willful breach by a Seller Indemnified
Party that is intended to impair Buyers benefits under this Agreement.

  

(e) If Seller and Buyer implement the Holding Company Transaction, on or
before the date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price for the
deemed sale of assets resulting from such transaction, setting forth the
estimated fair market values of the assets of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as required by Section 1060 of the Code. On or before the date
that is sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in developing the final allocation of such Purchase Price (the "
_Final Allocation_ "). If Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the Final
Allocation, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting
Firm, and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The
fees charged by the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with the
determination of the Final Allocation shall be borne by Buyer.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer may not
propose or otherwise seek to effect the implementation of the Partnership
Transaction pursuant to this _Section 5.25_  unless (i) the Holding Company
Transaction is rejected (or otherwise not approved) by the UK Tax Authority,
(ii) it is determined that the aggregate amount of Incremental Taxes and
Incremental Damages associated with the Holding Company Transaction
materially exceed the aggregate amount of Incremental Taxes and Incremental
Damages associated with the Partnership Transaction or (iii) the Seller
agrees otherwise; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to the foregoing clause
(i), Buyer or its Affiliates may approach the UK Tax Authority on a "no
names" basis with respect to the viability of the Partnership Transaction.

  

(g) Tax Treatment and Reporting.

  

(i) Prior to the implementation of the selected Alternate Transaction, Buyer
and Seller shall reasonably agree as to the proper Tax treatment and Tax
reporting (including with respect to any withholding Taxes) of the selected
Alternate

        

Transaction. Unless (after reasonable defense, at Buyers expense) required
to do otherwise by a final "determination," as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code or on the issue of a closure notice to an enquiry under paragraph 32,
Schedule 18 Finance Act 1998 or after a discovery assessment under paragraph
41 Schedule 18 Finance Act 1998, Buyer, Seller and their Subsidiaries shall
treat and report the selected Alternate Transaction consistently with such
agreement on all Tax Returns and other submissions (including for the
avoidance of doubt, related to Tax audits or enquiries) made to any Taxing
authority.

  

(ii) In furtherance of the foregoing and regardless of whether or not the
selected Alternate Transaction closes after any phase of such transaction has
been implemented, pursuant to Notice 89-57, 1989-1 CB 698, the Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall treat the filing requirements of Treas. Reg. Section
1.897-5T(d)(1)(iii) as suspended and shall not make any filings under Treas.
Reg. Section 1.897-5T(d)(1)(iii), including the declaration required by
Treas. Reg. Section 1.897-5T(d)(1)(iii)(H) thereof, unless (after reasonable
defense, at Buyers expense) there is a final "determination," as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code, indicating that such filings would reduce the Tax
imposed on the selected Alternate Transaction (or portion thereof), in which
case (A) such filings shall be made, and (B) Buyer shall be required to
indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties for any additional Tax imposed on Seller
Indemnified Parties at any time following the implementation of such phase,
and in connection with any transaction, to the extent such additional Tax
results from making such filings under Treas. Reg.
Section 1.897-5T(d)(1)(iii).

  

(h) If the Holding Company Transaction is implemented, Seller and its
Subsidiaries have no present plan or intention to liquidate Holdco. Seller
and its Subsidiaries currently intend that Holdco shall continue to hold an
interest in the Charterhouse Entities. For the period commencing immediately
after the Closing through December 31, 2007, Seller shall cause STE not to,
and STE shall not, derive any income that is effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business within the United States, excluding, for this
purpose, any such income that is attributable to (i) the consummation of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) the receipt of
distributions from Holdco; provided, however, that STE and Holdco shall use
their good faith efforts to cause such distributions not to exceed the sum of
(A) the earnings and profits of Holdco, and (B) the tax basis of the Holdco
stock.

  

(i) Except as provided in _Section 5.25(h)_ , Seller makes no representation,
warranty, or covenant concerning, and Buyer agrees not to allege breaches of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement in this Agreement
regarding, the Tax treatment of the selected Alternate Transaction or any
transaction executed in connection therewith, and shall not indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party for any Taxes or other Damages that are attributable,
in whole or in part, to the recharacterization of any such transaction by any
Tax authority; _provided_ ,  _that_ , Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have
acted in good faith consistent with their obligations under this _Section
5.25_ ; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if an Alternate Transaction is
recharacterized in a manner that reduces or eliminates the amount of
Incremental Taxes or Incremental Damages (if any) with respect to which a
Seller Indemnified Party has previously received an indemnification payment
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.25_ , then Seller (i) shall pay to
Buyer the excess of Incremental Damages paid to Seller Indemnified Parties by

        

Buyer over the Incremental Damages incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties
(after giving effect to such reduction or elimination), and (ii) shall apply
for a refund of such Incremental Taxes at the sole cost and expense of Buyer
and pay any refunded amounts over to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof.

  

(j) Seller shall notify Buyer in writing (" _Alternate Transaction Tax
Notice_ ") of any demand, claim, notice of enquiry, communication (either in
writing or by telephone contact), closure notice or discovery assessment
(collectively, a " _Tax Communication_ ") received by Seller Indemnified
Parties from any Tax authority or any other party with respect to Taxes
related to the selected Alternate Transaction and for which the Buyer may be
liable pursuant to this _Section 5.25_ within ten (10) days of the receipt of
such Tax Communication by Seller Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_
, that so long as Seller is acting reasonably and in good faith, a failure to
give such Alternate Transaction Tax Notice will not affect the rights of the
Seller Indemnified Parties to indemnification under this _Section 5.25_ ,
except to the extent that such failure prevents the Buyer from responding to
or contesting such Tax Communication. Buyer may elect to participate in or
control, through counsel or other representative chosen by Buyer and
reasonably acceptable to Seller and at Buyers own expense, any Contest
involving any asserted Tax liability in connection with the
selected Alternate Transaction and for which indemnity may be sought by
Seller Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.25_. Seller Indemnified
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in each phase of such Contest.
To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the procedures set forth
in _Section 5.12(e)_ shall apply for purposes of any such Contest.

  

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Partnership
Transaction shall not be implemented unless Seller and Buyer, each acting
reasonably and in good faith, enter into an amendment to this Agreement
setting forth the manner in which the transactions, if any, that occur with
respect to the Partnership Converted Entity or one of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries prior to Closing shall be treated for purposes of the other
provisions of this Agreement, including _Sections 2.3_ , _3.15_ , _5.12_ ,
and _Article VIII_.

  

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
calculation of Net Assets shall disregard in all respects any implementation
or attempted implementation of (and, if applicable, any concurrent or
subsequent rescission of, or payment of Damages in respect of indemnification
related to) any Alternate Transaction under this _Section 5.25_.

  

Section 5.26 _Certain Loan Consents_. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate to procure the consent to the Sale of the lenders under (i) the
Mortgage Loan Commitment between Torrey Pines Science Center Limited
Partnership and AEGON USA Realty Advisors, Inc., (ii) the Promissory Note
between Torrey Pines Science Center Limited Partnership and PFL
Life Insurance Company, (iii) the Mortgage Loan Commitment between LASDK
Limited Partnership and The Chase Manhattan Bank and (iv) the Deed of Trust
and Security Agreement among LASDK Limited Partnership, First American
Title Insurance Company and The Chase Manhattan Bank; _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) neither party shall have to pay any consideration to the lenders
to obtain such consent other than such consideration as is contemplated under
such agreements, which shall be deemed Repayment Premiums, and (ii) if any
such consent is not obtained at or prior to the Closing, the pro rata portion
of the

        

Indebtedness under the relevant agreement attributable to the Company based
on its equity ownership of Torrey Pines Science Center Limited Partnership
and LASDK Limited Partnership (as applicable) shall be treated as Closing
Indebtedness and shall be deemed to be listed on _Section 1.1A_ of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.  For the avoidance of doubt, in the event the Indebtedness
identified in the preceding sentence is refinanced or a consent is obtained
thereunder in respect of the Sale, then the pro rata portion of the
Indebtedness under the relevant agreement attributable to the Company based
on its equity ownership of Torrey Pines Science Center Limited Partnership
and LASDK Limited Partnership (as applicable) shall be deemed Other Company
Indebtedness.

  

Section 5.27 _Transfer of Warrants_. Seller shall cause its Affiliates to
transfer the warrants listed on _Section 5.27_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (the " _Warrants_ ") to Buyer or its Affiliates at Closing. The amount
of the Purchase Price allocated to the Warrants shall be equal to the fair
market value thereof as determined in good faith by the parties pursuant to
the procedures set forth in _Section 5.25(e)_ , applied mutatis mutandis.

(b) by Seller or Buyer, by giving written notice of such termination to the
other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September
30, 2007 (the " _Outside Date_ ") (unless the failure to consummate the
Closing by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under this
Agreement);

  

(c) by Seller or Buyer, upon written notice to the other, if any court of
competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Entity shall have

decree or injunction or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable, unless the failure to consummate the Closing because of such

(d) by Buyer if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and warranties of Seller

prior to the taking of the vote of the shareholders of Seller contemplated
hereby at the Seller Shareholders Meeting and such Acquisition Proposal is
still pending at the time of the Seller Shareholders Meeting, (B) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ , _Section 7.1(d)_ , or
_Section 7.1(f)_ , and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination
Seller or the Company enters into an agreement with any Person with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, then Seller shall pay

        

to Buyer an amount equal to $65,000,000 less the Buyer Expenses paid pursuant
to _Section 7.2(a)_ above (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within one (1) Business Day after the date Seller
enters into such agreement.

  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by a party hereto pursuant to _Section 7.1_ hereof, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other
parties hereto, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void
and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any
party hereto, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned
without further action by the parties hereto, except that the provisions of
_Article I_ , _Section 5.6_ , _Section 7.2_ , _Article VIII_  and _Article
IX_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that if such termination shall result from (i) the willful and material
breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement or (ii) Buyers or Sellers failure to
pay any portion of the Closing Consideration, the Closing Indebtedness,
the Repayment Premiums, Final Aggregate Company Indebtedness Adjustment, or
Final Net Assets Adjustment due to the other party upon the satisfaction or

_Section 3.23_ , _Section 4.1_ , _Section 4.2_ and _Section 4.8_
shall survive indefinitely and shall not terminate; _provided_ , _however_
, that the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.22_

_further_ , that the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.15_ shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
relevant statute of limitations

        

(including extensions). If any party makes a claim with respect to any
specific representation and warranty within the time period described in the
preceding sentence, and such claim is not completely and finally resolved
prior to the expiration of such time period, such representation or warranty
shall survive solely with respect to any such claim until such claim is
finally and fully resolved.

  

Section 8.2 _Indemnification._

  

(a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and
their Representatives in their capacity as such (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of, and will pay to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties the amount of, any damages, losses,
charges, liabilities, claims, demands, Actions, settlements, Taxes, interest,
penalties and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), other than any consequential,
incidental, lost profits, punitive, indirect or special damages
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") incurred or suffered by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of Third Party Claims, or claims
between the parties hereto, provided such Damages arise out of or relate to
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller contained in
this Agreement, without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifications therein except as set forth in _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter and without giving effect to the Knowledge
qualifier in the last sentence of _Section 3.19_ , **** (ii) any breach of
any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement or (iii) any
Plan subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of any
environmental issues arising under any representation or warranty shall be
limited exclusively to a breach of _Section 3.22_.

  

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives in their capacity as such (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ " and, together with the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of,
and will pay to the Seller Indemnified Parties the amount of, any Damages
incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of
Third Party Claims, or claims between the parties hereto, provided such
Damages arise out of or relate to (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty made by Buyer contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of
any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement or (iii) any
Action by any Person arising before or after the Closing against any of the
Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to the operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, except for Actions in respect of which Seller is obligated
to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_.

  

(c) Promptly upon the receipt by an Indemnified Party under _Section 8.2(a)_
or _Section 8.2(b)_ of any notice of the commencement of any action, claim or
other matter brought by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Person
shall give notice of such Third Party Claim to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), but the failure to
give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any liability it
may have to such Person, except to the extent the defense of such Third Party
Claim is prejudiced by such Persons failure to give notice. If an
Indemnified Party gives such notice, the Indemnifying Party, upon
giving notice to such Indemnified Party, will be entitled to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense and the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to prosecute, appeal, negotiate, resolve,
settle, compromise, arbitrate or otherwise pursue such Third Party Claim, in
whole or in part, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party exercises its rights to assume the
defense of

        

such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to
indemnify or pay for or reimburse any Indemnified Party for any attorneys
fees, investigation costs or litigation expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party after the assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any pending or threatened Third Party Claim relating to the
matters contemplated hereby if any Indemnified Party is a party thereto or
has been actually threatened to be made a party thereto unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising or that may arise out of
such Third Party Claim or provides solely for monetary relief satisfied by
the Indemnifying Party.  The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any Third Party Claim by an Indemnified Party without the
Indemnifying Partys written consent.

  

(d) No claim may be asserted nor may any Action be commenced against an
Indemnifying Party for breach of any representation or warranty, unless
written notice of such claim or action is received by such party on or prior
to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or
Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section 8.1_ , regardless
of whether the subject matter of such claim or Action shall have occurred
before or after such date.

  

(e) No indemnity shall be payable to any Indemnified Party with respect to
any claim under this _Section 8.2_ resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty (except as set forth in the last sentence of this
_Section 8.2(e)_ ) unless and until the aggregate of all Damages incurred or
suffered by the Indemnified Party exceeds $25,000,000, and then only by
Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties and by Buyer to the Seller
Indemnified Parties to the extent of such excess; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the aggregate amount payable by Seller to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and by Buyer to the Seller Indemnified Parties with
respect to claims under this _Section 8.2_ resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty other than a breach of _Section 3.22_  shall not
exceed 4% of the Purchase Price, and (ii) the aggregate amount payable by
Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to claims under this
_Section 8.2_ resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty,
including a breach of Section 3.22, shall not exceed 8% of the Purchase
Price; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Seller shall only pay one-
half of any Damages incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
with respect to claims under this _Section 8.2_  resulting from any breach of
_Section 3.22_ that are in excess of the 4% limitation, up to an aggregate
amount payable by Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties equal to the 8%
limitation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deductible or limitation on
the maximum aggregate amount payable to any indemnified party shall be
applicable to (i) Damages arising out of breaches or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_ ,  _Section 3.2_ ,
_Section 3.3_ , _Section 3.6_ , _Section 3.15_ ,  _Section 3.23_ , _Section
4.1_ , _Section 4.2_ , and _Section 4.8_ , (ii) Damages arising out of
breaches of any covenant or obligation of Buyer or Seller under this
Agreement, (iii) Damages arising out of or resulting from fraud by the
Indemnifying Party or (iv)

        

Damages arising out of or relating to any Plan subject to the laws of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States.

  

(f) Absent fraud, the indemnity provided herein shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any Damages sustained or incurred resulting
from any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or Buyer in
this Agreement.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.2_ , the
provisions of _Section 8.2(c)_ shall not apply to the defense of any claims
related to any Damages attributable to a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.15_  and (ii) giving rise to
indemnification for Taxes under _Section 5.12(a)_  . Such defense shall be
exclusively governed by the provisions of _Section 5.12(e)_.

  

(h) The amount of any Damages payable under this _Section 8.2_ by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from third parties
and net of any Tax benefits actually received by the Indemnified Party as a
result of incurring the Damages. For purposes of the foregoing, an
Indemnified Party will be deemed to have actually received a Tax benefit to
the extent that the amount of Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party as shown
on such Persons Tax Return for the year in which the Damages are incurred or
in an earlier year is reduced below the amount of Taxes that the Indemnified
Party would have been required to pay in such year but for the deduction
attributable to the incurrence of the Damages.

  

(i) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, to mitigate any claim or liability that an
Indemnified Party asserts or is reasonably likely to assert under this
_Article VIII_.

  

 **ARTICLE IX**

  

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

  

Section 9.1 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not assignable unless such assignment is consented to in
writing by both Buyer and Seller or Seller assigns its rights or
obligations hereunder to one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Buyer shall be entitled to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder, in whole or in part, to one or more of its Affiliates, without the
prior written consent of Seller, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer
of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

  

Section 9.2 _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state to the extent that
the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction would be
required thereby.

        

Section 9.3 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial_

  

(a) With respect to any Action, each party irrevocably (i) agrees and
consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in the borough of Manhattan and (ii) waives any objection which
it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Action brought in any
such court, waives any claim that such Action has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to
such Action, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.
The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not constitute general consent to
service of process in the State of New York for any purpose except as
provided above and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the respective parties to this Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer
irrevocably agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document
by United States registered mail to such partys address set forth in
_Section 9.4_ shall be effective service of process for any Action in New
York with respect to any matters for which it has submitted to jurisdiction
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_.

  

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation as between the parties directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or disputes relating hereto. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledge that
it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Agreement by,
among other things, the mutual waivers in this _Section 9.3(b)_.

  

(c) In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with this
Agreement, Seller shall have the right, at its election, to retain the firm
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP to represent it in such matter
and Buyer, for itself, its Affiliates and for its and their successors and
assigns, hereby irrevocably waives any objections to and consents to any such
representation in any such matter. Buyer, for itself, its Affiliates and for
its and their successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that it will not seek to obtain by any process any attorney-client
privileged communications between Seller and its counsel, including, without
limitation, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement, or
any matter relating to any of the foregoing.

  

Section 9.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and
other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally, when sent by
confirmed cable, telecopy or facsimile, when sent by an internationally
recognized overnight courier service or when mailed by certified or

Section 9.5 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting
or construing any of the provisions contained in this Agreement.

  

Section 9.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this
Agreement, each party hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses (including
investment advisory and legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that
Buyer shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes attributable to
the transactions contemplated hereby (as well as the filing of all Tax
Returns with respect thereto).

  

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect to such subject matter;

        

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , for the sake of clarity, it is understood that
this Agreement shall not supersede the terms and provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and remain in effect until
expiration or termination thereof in accordance with their respective terms
and this Agreement.

  

Section 9.8 _Disclosure_. Any matter disclosed in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter shall be considered disclosed with respect to each other
Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter provided that it is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure to be relevant to such
other Section. The inclusion of information in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material or that such matter actually constitutes
noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Law, Permit or Contract or other
topic to which such disclosure is applicable.

  

Section 9.9 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by
Seller and Buyer.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof
only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such
obligations, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  

Section 9.10 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except with respect to _Section
5.17_ , this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
their permitted assigns and nothing herein express or implied shall give or
be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such
permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

  

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to either party hereto. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

  

Section 9.13 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed or delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in any number of
counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which together shall

        

be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding upon all of the parties
hereto notwithstanding the fact that all parties are not signatory to the
original or the same counterpart.

  

Section 9.14 _No Right of Setoff_. No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof
may deduct from, set off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner
whatsoever any amount owed to it hereunder against any amounts owed hereunder
by such Persons to the other party hereto or any of such other
partys Affiliates.

  

Section 9.15 _Time of the Essence_. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time hereby is made
expressly of the essence.

  

Section 9.16 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_.  Buyer and Seller each
acknowledge that each has been represented by counsel in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, any rule of
Law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
