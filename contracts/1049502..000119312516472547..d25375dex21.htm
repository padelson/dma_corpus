case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or

 



\- 3 -  securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or
other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit or
authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise
authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to, or that is otherwise
prohibited by, this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit (each, a " _Company
RSU_ ") granted under any stock option or equity compensation plan,
arrangement or agreement of the Company (the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which Shares
will not have been fully distributed in connection with the Closing shall be
assumed by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Each such Company RSU so assumed by Parent shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the same vesting
conditions) as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (i) such Company RSU shall be an award for common stock, no par value, of
Parent (" _Parent Stock_ "), and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Stock
subject to each such assumed award shall be determined by multiplying the
number of Shares underlying such Company RSU by a fraction (the " _Equity
Award Exchange Ratio_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share), the
numerator of which shall be the Merger Consideration and the denominator of
which shall be the average of the volume weighted average price per share of
Parent Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") over the five
consecutive trading days ending on the second complete trading day preceding
the Closing Date.

(b) At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right granted under a
Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company SAR_ ", and each Company SAR and
Company RSU being referred to as a " _Company Equity Award_ "), whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Each such Company SAR so assumed by Parent shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
vesting schedule) as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that (i) such Company SAR shall be an award for Parent Stock, (ii) the
number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each such appreciation right
shall be determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (iii) the base
value per share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall
equal (x) the per share base value for the Shares otherwise receivable
pursuant to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to each holder of a Company Equity Award assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.2 an appropriate notice setting forth the terms of
such assumption.

 



\- 4 - (d) The Company shall take such actions as may be necessary with
respect to the Companys employee stock purchase plan (the " _Company ESPP_
") to cause, no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i)
accumulated contributions under any then-ongoing offering or purchase period
to be used to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company
ESPP and (ii) the termination of all options or purchase rights under all such
ongoing offering or purchase periods immediately after such purchase. Any
Shares so purchased shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.1 above.
The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to terminate the
Company ESPP no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing
Date in accordance with its terms in such manner as results in no participant
in the Company ESPP having any right at or after the Effective Time to (A)
purchase Shares or any other security of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Person under the Company ESPP or (B) receive any
cash payment or other consideration for his or her terminated rights under the
Company ESPP (other than a refund of amounts withheld by the Company on behalf
of such participant that have not been used to purchase Shares prior to the
termination of the Company ESPP, without interest, pursuant to the terms of
the Company ESPP upon the termination of the Company ESPP). The Company shall
cause the Company ESPPs new offerings to be frozen such that no offering
or purchase period will begin on or after the date of this Agreement.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions,
and take such other actions, as may be reasonably required to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.2.

 

(f) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Stock at
least equal to the number of shares of Parent Stock that will be subject to
assumed Company Equity Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this
Section 2.2. When and if necessary to deliver registered shares, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of
Parent Stock subject to such Company Equity Awards and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of
the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Company
Equity Awards remain outstanding and are required to be registered.

 

(g) Where Parent determines it appropriate for purposes of non-U.S. Law to
vary the treatment of equity compensation from that provided in Section 2.2
with respect to Company Equity Awards (including those held in escrow or as
deferred compensation), Parent may change the treatment to take into account
tax, securities, employment, or other considerations, with the consent of the
Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Parent will consult with the Company and may agree to different treatment with
respect to Company Equity Awards held by directors of the Company from
that provided in Section 2.2.

Section 2.3 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement
with the Companys transfer agent or another bank or trust company mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company to act as paying agent in connection with
the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to

 



\- 5 -  receive the Merger Consideration to which stockholders of the Company shall
become entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments pursuant to this Article II
owed in respect of Shares represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to
this Article II, except as provided in this Agreement. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Article II.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall direct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an
outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ "), and
to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ "), that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
such Person shall pass, only upon (x) adherence to the procedures set forth
in the letter of transmittal and (y) in the case of Shares represented by
Certificates, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
and the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Surrender of any Book-Entry
Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Paying Agents customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or each
Book-Entry Share so surrendered (subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax), and the Certificate, if any, so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person
requesting such payment present proper evidence of transfer and, if
applicable, the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered shall have
delivered to the Paying Agent instruments of transfer in such form as the
Paying Agent may require in accordance with its customary procedures for the
transfer for securities represented by book entry and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 



\- 6 - (d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3,
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any
interest thereon.

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration, except as otherwise provided by
applicable Law. Subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 2.3(g), if,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer (or for any other reason) or
transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that any investment of such cash shall in
all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the
Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations
to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to Section 2.4),
Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which
is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy
such cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be payable to, and shall be the property of, Parent.

 

(g) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have
been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general unsecured
creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



\- 7 - (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article II.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, any Company Equity
Awards or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement any transfer Tax due and any
such other amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. If any
withholding obligation may be avoided by such holder providing information or
documentation to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
holder may provide such information or documentation in a timely fashion and
avoid such withholding.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents that are publicly

or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than any specific factual
information contained therein), or (b) as set forth in the disclosure letter
(which is arranged in sections and subsections corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections and subsections contained in this Article III)
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement

information in a particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure only with respect to (a) the correspondingly
numbered and/or lettered section or subsection of this Agreement and (b) any
other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



\- 8 - Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) is an entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties and assets
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, with respect to
clause (i) as it relates to Subsidiaries, and clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such failures to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing as, individually or in the aggregate, do not, and
would not reasonably be expected to, have a Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event,
change, occurrence or effect that has a material adverse effect on (A) the
business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, financial condition or results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B)
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
other than, in the case of the foregoing clause (A), any change, effect,
event or occurrence arising after the date of this Agreement to the extent
resulting from (1) changes in general economic, financial market, business or
geopolitical conditions, (2) general changes or developments in any of
the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate, (3) natural
disasters or calamities, (4) changes in any applicable Laws or applicable
accounting regulations or principles or interpretations thereof, (5) any
change in the price or trading volume of the Companys stock, in and of
itself ( _provided_ , that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to such change that are not otherwise excluded from the
definition of "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining
the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect), (6) any failure by the Company
to meet any published analyst estimates or expectations of the Companys
revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for
any period, in and of itself, or any failure by the Company to meet its
internal or published projections, budgets, plans or forecasts of its
revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations,
in and of itself ( _provided_ , that the facts or occurrences giving rise to
or contributing to such failure that are not otherwise excluded from the
definition of "Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into account
in determining the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect), (7) any outbreak
or escalation of armed hostilities, any acts of war or terrorism, (8) other
than for purposes of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.4,
the announcement or pendency of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including (x) any resulting loss or departure of officers
or other employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y) any
resulting termination of, reduction in or similar negative impact on the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries relationships, contractual or otherwise,
with any customers, suppliers, distributors or business partners, (9) any
litigation brought by or on behalf of any current or former Company
stockholder (in its capacity as such) arising from allegations of any breach
of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement or the Merger or violation of
securities Law related to the Proxy Statement or any other document required
to be filed by the Company with the SEC or required to be distributed or
otherwise disseminated to the Companys stockholders in connection with the
Merger, (10) any action taken by the Company, or which the Company causes to
be taken by any of its Subsidiaries, in each case which is expressly required
by this Agreement (excluding Section 5.1(a)), and (11) any actions

 



\- 9 -  taken (or omitted to be taken) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with the prior written consent or at the express written request of Parent;
_provided_ , that any change, effect, event or occurrence otherwise excluded
by any of the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) or (7) shall be taken into
account in determining the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect to the
extent disproportionately impacting the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as whole, relative to other Persons operating in the industries or markets in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties agree that the terms "material," "materially" and "materiality"
as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their
respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meaning
ascribed to Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) The Company has previously made available to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of the Companys articles of incorporation (the " _Company
Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), in each case as amended to
the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and
effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws in any material respect.

investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in
any Person.

 



\- 12 - Section 3.3 _Authority_. The Company has all necessary corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and, subject to the adoption and approval of this
Agreement by the holders of at least a majority in combined voting power of
the outstanding Shares (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity). On or prior to the date hereof, at a meeting duly called and held,
the Company Board, acting on the unanimous recommendation of the independent
committee of the Company Board, has unanimously (i) resolved that this

subsections contained in this Article IV) delivered by Parent to the Company
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ")
(it being agreed that disclosure of any information in a particular section
or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure only
with respect to (a) the correspondingly numbered and/or lettered section or
subsection of this Agreement and (b) any other section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent
on its face), Parent and the Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such failures to have such power and
authority or to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing as,
individually or in the aggregate, does not, and would not reasonably be
expected to, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, change,
occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate with all other

Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, to the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State as required by the NRS. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,

extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of

Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or violate the
articles of organization or bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents
of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (iv) of subsection (b)
below have been obtained and all filings described in such clauses have been
made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or
by which any of their respective assets, rights or properties are bound or
subject or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute

 



\- 33 -  a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would
become a default), or result in the loss of a benefit or imposition of an
obligation under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
amendment or acceleration of, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party or by which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective assets,
rights or properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflict, breach, violation, default, loss, right or other
occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except for (i) such filings as may be required under
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and under state securities and "blue sky" laws, (ii)
the filings required under the HSR Act and any filings required under Foreign

be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time it is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company, at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereto, or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or
warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the Company or any
of its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties by or before any Governmental Entity and (b) neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject
to any judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree of any
Governmental Entity.

Section 4.6 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated
hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other business
activities and will have incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as
contemplated herein. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 of which are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or
indirectly by Parent.

 



\- 34 - Section 4.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true
and complete copies of (i) an executed commitment letter dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Fee Letter (as
defined below), together, as they may be amended, modified or replaced
in accordance with Section 5.2 and together with all annexes, exhibits,
schedules and other attachments thereto the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ ")
pursuant to which the lender parties thereto have agreed, subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts
set forth therein (such amounts, the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) the fee
letters referred to in such commitment letter (with only fee amounts,
dates, pricing caps, "market flex" and other economic terms redacted, none of
which would adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing
(the " _Fee Letter_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, none of the
Debt Financing Commitments has been amended or modified, and the respective
commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn or rescinded and, to the knowledge of Parent, no withdrawal or
rescission thereof is contemplated as of the date of this Agreement. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitments are in full force
and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity). There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a
breach or default under the Debt Financing Commitments by Parent or Merger Sub
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Debt Financing
Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions contained in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, Parent has no reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition to be satisfied by it and contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the terms of the Debt Financing Commitments to be paid
on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions contained in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 and that the Financing is
funded in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter, Parent and
Merger Sub will have, at the Effective Time, sufficient cash, available lines
of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of all amounts required to
be paid pursuant to Article II, and to pay all related fees and expenses. In
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing, including under the Debt Financing Commitments, by Parent or
Merger Sub or any Affiliate thereof be a condition to any of Parents or
Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

 

Section 4.8 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
vote or consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall
have occurred prior to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to
approve this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



\- 35 - Section 4.9 _NRS 78.378 to 78.3793 and NRS 78.411 to 78.444; Ownership of
Shares_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
"affiliates" or "associates" is, nor at any time during the last two years has
any such Person been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, in each
case as such term is defined in NRS 78.3787 and NRS 78.423, nor has any such
Person acted in association with an "acquiring person" for the purpose of
acquiring "control shares" or voting rights with respect to "control shares,"
as "acquiring person" and "control shares" are defined in NRS 78.3782 and NRS
78.3784, respectively. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of
record) any Shares or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares except
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Company
acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise, nothing herein shall, or shall
be deemed or construed to, relieve any Person from liability for fraud,
limit any recourse or remedy available in respect of fraud, or preclude a
determination that a fraud occurred.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the proceeds of
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (including any
flex provisions applicable thereto), including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained therein or on
other terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) and not in violation of this
Section 5.2(a) (including clauses (A)-(C) below), (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed
advisable by Parent, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments that are
within its control and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder and
pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date, (iii) maintain in effect
the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance with the terms thereof (except
for amendments and supplements not prohibited by this Section 5.2(a))
until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and (iv) enforce its
rights under the Debt Financing Commitments in the event of a breach by any
counterparty thereto. Parent shall have the right from time to time to amend,
supplement, amend and restate or modify the Debt Financing Commitments;
_provided_ , that any such amendment, supplement, amendment and restatement or
other modification shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company (A) add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions precedent to
the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments as in effect
on the date hereof, (B) except as otherwise set forth herein, reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing Commitments (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing as
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments) in a manner that would adversely
impact the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or that would otherwise
be expected to delay or impede the Merger or

 



\- 39 -  (C) otherwise be reasonably expected to (1) prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing as set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitments less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their rights against the other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend, supplement,
amend and restate, modify or replace the Debt Financing Commitments as in
effect at the date hereof (x) to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement or (y) to increase
the amount of Indebtedness contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments.
For purposes of this Section 5.2, references to " _Debt Financing_ " shall
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments
(including any flex provisions applicable thereto) as permitted to be
amended, supplemented, replaced or modified by this Section 5.2(a) (and, if
applicable, shall include any Alternative Financing used to satisfy the
obligations under this Agreement) and references to " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ " shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or
modified by this Section 5.2(a) (and, if applicable, shall include any
commitments in respect of Alternative Financing). Parent shall (X) give the
Company prompt notice of any material breach or default by any party to the
Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing, in each case of which
Parent has become aware, and any purported termination or repudiation by any
party of the Debt Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing, in each
case of which Parent has become aware, or upon receipt of written notice of
any material dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to the Debt
Financing Commitments or any Alternative Financing and (Y) otherwise keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of Parents efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing upon Companys reasonable request. In the event any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, but
alternative facilities are available on terms and conditions substantially
similar to the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly arrange to obtain alternative financing ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the terms of such
Alternative Financing do not expand upon the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date as set
forth in the Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement or
otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall
have the right to substitute the net cash proceeds received by Parent after
the date hereof and prior to the Closing from consummated offerings or other
incurrences of debt (including notes) by Parent for all or any portion of the
Debt Financing by reducing commitments under the Commitment Letter; _provided_
, that (w) to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or mandatory
redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earlier of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or the Termination Date as
applicable, (x) such offering or other incurrence of debt does not result in a
breach or default under, or violation of, the Commitment Letter, (y) the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing committed under the Commitment Letter
following such reduction, together with other cash and cash equivalents
available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the

 



\- 40 -  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (z) Parent promptly notifies
the Company of such substitution and reduction. If commitments under the
Commitment Letter have been reduced to zero in connection with the preceding
sentence, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Section 5.2(b) shall no longer be in effect. Further, Parent shall have the
right to substitute commitments in respect of other debt financings for all
or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative bona
fide financing sources so long as (v) such other debt financing does not
result in a breach or default under, or violation of, the Commitment Letter
(to the extent it remains in effect following such substitution), (w) the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, together with other cash and cash
equivalents available to Parent, is sufficient to pay all amounts required to
be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(x) all conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for
such debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to
funding of such financing are, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent
to (or more favorable to Parent than) the conditions precedent set forth in
the Commitment Letter, (y) such substitution would not reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing or
such other debt financing on the Closing Date and (z) prior to funding of any
loans thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing are
subject to restrictions on assignment that are in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the Company that the
corresponding restrictions set forth in the Commitment Letter, to supplement
or replace the Debt Financing. True, correct and complete copies of each
amendment or modification to the Commitment Letter relating thereto and
documents with respect to each alternative or substitute financing commitment
in respect thereof (each, a " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ "), together with
all related fee letters (solely in the case of the fee letter, with only the
fee amounts, dates, pricing caps, "market flex" and other economic terms
redacted) (each, a " _New Fee Letter_ "), will be promptly provided to the
Company (and drafts thereof shall be made available to the Company prior to
any such substitution). In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is
obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall
include the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter which is
not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and
each New Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (iii) any
reference in this Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee
letter relating to the Commitment Letter that is not superseded by any New
Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and to each New Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect.

 

(b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to provide, on a timely basis all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing ( _provided_ ; that
such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business
or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) furnishing
the financial information with respect to the Company described in paragraph 3
of Exhibit C to the Commitment Letter and such other historical
financial information or other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources to
consummate the Debt Financing and customarily included in marketing materials
for senior secured bank lending transactions, in each case in advance of the
Marketing Period (all such information in this clause (i), collectively, the "
_Required Information_ "); (ii) furnishing the report of the Companys
independent accountants on the most recently available audited

 



\- 41 -  consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
obtaining the consent of such accountants to the use of such report in
accordance with the accountants normal custom and practice and causing such

Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries respective operations. This Section 5.3 shall in no way

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
and that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall authorize or permit any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage

Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (or propose to
do so); or

 

(iv) execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar Contract relating to
an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , in each case, it is understood and agreed that any
determination or action by the Company Board expressly permitted
under Section 5.4(b), Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e) or Section 7.1(c)(ii)
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4(a).
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4(a) by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether such Person is purporting to
act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 5.4(a) by the Company.

 



\- 44 - (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a),
but subject to the requirements of the remainder of this Section 5.4, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received
after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of Section 5.4(a) and
that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and its independent financial advisor, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Company than, the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes
specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement) and (ii) participate in discussions
or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Subject to the actions expressly permitted by Section 7.1(c)(ii)(on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, its recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of such actions, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, the
Company Board or any committee thereof may, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, make an Adverse Recommendation Change only if:

 

(i) the Company Board or such committee has determined that a Superior
Proposal is outstanding;

 

(ii) the Company Board or such committee reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial
advisor, that its fiduciary obligations require it to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, but only after the fifth Business Day following
Parents receipt of written notice (an " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ")
advising Parent that the Company Board or such committee desires to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (and the manner and timing in which it intends
to do so) (such five Business Day period, the " _Notice Period_ ");

(iii) the Company provides Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and negotiates in
good faith with Parent with respect thereto during the Notice Period, in each
case as would enable the Company Board or such committee to proceed with its
recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the Merger;

(iv) the Company complies with the requirements of Section 5.4(g); and

 



\- 45 - (v) Parent does not, at or prior to the end of the Notice Period, make
an offer or proposal that the Company Board or such committee determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its independent
financial advisor) to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view as such Superior Proposal.

Any change to the financial terms or any material change to the other terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new Notice Period and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 5.4(d) with respect to each such Adverse
Recommendation Notice; _provided_ , that each such new Notice Period shall be
shortened to three Business Days following the receipt of the corresponding
new Adverse Recommendation Notice.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, the
Company Board or any committee thereof may, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
material development or change in circumstances (not relating to any
Acquisition Proposal) that affects the business, assets or operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that was neither
known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the
date hereof (such material development or change in circumstances, an "
_Intervening Event_ ") only if:

(i) the Company Board or such committee has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial
advisor, that, in light of such Intervening Event, its fiduciary obligations
require it to make an Adverse Recommendation Change;

 

(ii) the Company has provided written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change advising
Parent that the Company Board or such committee intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable
detail; and

 

(iii) during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company has engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

(f) No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board, including in any
respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Nevada)
corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. Nothing in
Section 5.4(d) shall be deemed to permit the Company to take any action
described in Section 5.4(a)(iv) unless simultaneously therewith the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) and pays
the Termination Fee.

(g) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other
than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or

 



\- 46 -  negotiation regarding, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, including in each case the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall (A) keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and details (including any change to
the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, (B)
contemporaneously with providing any information (including any correspondence
or other written material) to a third party in connection with any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, furnish a true, correct
and complete copy of such information (including information provided by
electronic mail) to Parent, (C) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and
in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof true, correct
and complete copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Representatives, including those
provided by electronic mail, from any third party in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (D) if Parent shall make a
counterproposal, consider in good faith the terms of such counterproposal. The
Company agrees that it shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to,
enter into any Contract that prohibits or restricts it from providing to
Parent the information contemplated by, or otherwise complying with, this
Section 5.4(g), Section 5.4(c), Section 5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e).

 

(h) Subject to the proviso to this sentence, nothing set forth in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or Schedule 14D-9 or (ii) making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders, if, in the case of the foregoing
clause (i) or clause (ii), in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose such information
would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, the Company Board
or any committee of the Company Board take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 5.4(c), except as expressly permitted by Section
5.4(d) or Section 5.4(e).

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately all communications, discussions and
negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall request the
prompt return or destruction of all copies of all nonpublic data and
information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have
distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement to other potential
purchasers. 

(j) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
for (A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, tender offer,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (B) the
acquisition in any manner (including by virtue of any equity interest),
directly or indirectly, of (1) 15% or more of the consolidated total assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (2) securities that, in the aggregate with
any securities then owned by such Person or group of Persons, would result in
such Person or group of Persons owning 15% or more of the equity securities of
the Company.

 



\- 47 - (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof (A) on terms which the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
its independent financial advisors, to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Shares than the Merger, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal, and this Agreement (including
any timely proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement delivered
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.4(d)) and (B) that,
after consultation with outside counsel and its independent financial
advisors, the Company Board reasonably believes is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal; _provided_ , that (x) for purposes of the definition
of "Superior Proposal," the references to "15%" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%" and (y) no
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a Superior Proposal if any financing
required to consummate such Acquisition Proposal is not committed.

 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
(and, in any event, not later than the 15th Business Day immediately
thereafter), the Company shall (i) prepare (with Parents reasonable
cooperation to the extent required) and file with the SEC a proxy statement
(as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to
be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the special meeting of
the Companys stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be
held to consider the adoption and approval of this Agreement and (ii) set a
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and commence a broker search
pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. No
filing or mailing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will
be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon (and including therein all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent) and without the prior approval of Parent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld). The Company will advise Parent promptly after it
receives any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement or comments on the Proxy Statement and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide
Parent with true, correct and complete copies of any written communication
from the SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the responses thereto. The Company shall respond to any
requests or comments from the SEC as promptly as practicable and will provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and include
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent in such any response); _provided_ ,
that the Company will not file or otherwise deliver to the SEC any such
response without the prior approval of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders on or prior to the third Business Day after the
resolution of any comments thereon from the SEC or, if the SEC does not
inform the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before
the 10th calendar day following the filing of the Proxy Statement, on or prior
to the third Business Day following such 10th calendar day. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for
filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 5.5(a)
to comply in all

 



\- 48 -  material respects with all applicable requirements of Law. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by the
Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not contain any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall promptly be filed by the Company
with the SEC and, to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated
by the Company to stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , that the delivery
of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any
party hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any
party.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the resolution of any
comments on the Proxy Statement from the SEC (or, if the SEC does not inform
the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement on or before the
10th calendar day following the filing of the Proxy Statement, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following such 10th calendar day), the Company, acting
through the Company Board, shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company Board
may (and, in the case of the following clauses (ii) and (iii), shall if
requested by Parent) postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting: (i)
with the consent of Parent; (ii)(A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if
the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, to solicit additional proxies; (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel and Parent is necessary under applicable law, and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; or (iv)
if the Company Board has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
(and in compliance with) Section 5.4(e) and the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting would violate NRS
92A.120, for so long as is necessary to avoid such violation; _provided_ ,
that (x) nothing in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) shall permit any
postponement or adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date on
or after the date that is 10 Business Days prior to the Termination Date and
(y) the Company may postpose or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, and
Parent may request that the Company postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting, pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) only three times
each and, subject to the foregoing clause (x), in each case only for up to
10 Business Days.

(c) Except to the extent that the Company Board shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 5.4(d) or Section
5.4(e), the Company, through the Company Board, shall (i) recommend to its
stockholders that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 7.1 and, to the extent required under the terms of this Agreement,
the 

 



\- 49 -  Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3,
the Companys obligations pursuant to Section 5.5(b) and this Section 5.5(c)
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition
Proposal. Subject to Section 5.4, the Company shall take all action that is
both reasonable and lawful to (x) solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and, if applicable, the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith, and (y) secure the vote of the stockholders of the Company
required by the rules of NASDAQ or the NRS to obtain such adoption and
approvals.

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, upon reasonable prior
written notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees and
representatives to, afford to Parent reasonable access during normal business
hours, consistent with applicable Law, to the respective officers, employees,
properties, offices, other facilities and books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent shall reasonably request in writing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i) breach
any Contract with any third party in effect on the date hereof, (ii)
constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law; _provided_
, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such
access or disclose such information in a manner that would not result in any
of the consequences referred to in any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii).

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 4, 2015, between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to (i) disclose
nonpublic or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Financing Sources, rating agencies and prospective lenders and
investors during syndication of any financing subject to their entering into
customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information
(including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in
confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities), and (ii)
publicly disclose the Required Information and pro forma financial
information provided to any Financing Source under any confidential
information memoranda prepared in connection with any financing sought or
obtained by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



\- 50 - Section 5.7 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,

order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
(including under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the transactions

as promptly as practicable making all necessary filings, and thereafter make
any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the

VI.

(c) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity required in connection
with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including, to the extent
related thereto:

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be
made by any party under any Antitrust Law and in relation to each step of the
procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities, and informing each other
as to the contents of all substantive communications with such Governmental

Entity, no party will make any notification or other submission in relation to
the transactions contemplated hereunder without first providing the other
party with a true, correct and complete copy of such notification in draft
form and giving such other party a reasonable opportunity to comment before it
is filed with the relevant Governmental Entities, and such first party shall
consider in good faith all reasonable comments timely made by the other party

Section 5.8 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") may have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in
writing between Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, to maintain the severance-related provisions of existing Company Plans
and to provide 100% of the cash severance payments required thereunder to be
provided to any Company Employee who does not have an individual Contract
providing for severance and is terminated without "cause" (using criteria
comparable to those in effect under Parents severance policies and subject
to a required release of claims on a form to be provided by Parent in
connection with such terms).

 

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may
have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, (i) for the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, to maintain
for each Company Employee employed as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") base salary levels no less favorable than that in effect as of
the date hereof and (ii) for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2016, to maintain for each Continuing Employee other
cash compensation levels (such term to consist of percentage of salary used
for target bonus opportunities (on metrics set by Parent) and
commission programs) no less favorable than that in effect as of the date
hereof. Any other Company Plans and benefits not specifically described in
this Section 5.8 will be provided in the sole discretion of Parent.

 



\- 52 - (c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide or
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide
Continuing Employees full credit for the Continuing Employees service with
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and benefit accruals under Parents 401(k) plan,
vacation accrual rates, sick time accrual rates, service used for determining
severance under the applicable policy or Contract, and any pre-Closing Date
Company Equity Awards that are assumed by Parent to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
maintain in place, from the Effective Time through December 31, 2016, the pre-
Closing Company Plans that provide medical, dental, vision, employee
assistance, short-term disability and long-term disability benefits. Such
coverage for the Continuing Employees will transition to Parent-provided
benefit plans effective January 1, 2017, at which point Parent will be
changing its benefits to a calendar year plan year. Parent will provide the
Continuing Employees with credit in 2017 for deductibles, co-payments and out-
of-pocket maximums for the period between July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016
in a manner comparable to the crediting it applies to Parent employees at
that time, if and when Parent can obtain sufficient information from the
insurance carriers or other sources to make it practicable to provide such
credits.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in
writing between Parent or any of its Affiliates and a Continuing Employee or
as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the applicable individual written
Contract, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to honor in
accordance with its terms, (i) each existing written employment, retention,
change in control, severance and termination Contract of or between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of
that company, (ii) all written obligations in effect as of the Effective Time
under any equity-based, bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or Contracts
of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (iii) all vested and accrued benefits
under any Company Plans or Contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, new deferrals under the Company 2005 Deferred
Compensation Plan will cease no later than the Closing Date.

 

(f) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent evidence that the Company has terminated each Company Plan
intended to comply with Section 401(k) of the Code in a form and on terms and
timing reasonably satisfactory to Parent, prospectively effective no later
than the day before the Effective Time.

 

(g) This Section 5.8 shall not apply with respect to individuals covered by
collective bargaining agreements or other collective representations, in
which case the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement or
collective representation shall apply, or with respect to individuals or
Company Plans subject to non-United States Law, in which case Parent agrees
to comply or cause its Subsidiaries to comply with any applicable Laws or
employment Contracts with respect to compensation and benefits. Section 5.8 is
included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not create any right
in any Person, including any current or former employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary or
trustee

amend any of the foregoing, (iii) is intended to confer upon any individual
any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time, or

construed to indicate the existence of employment relations between the
Company or any of its Affiliates and any of its or their service providers
(including contractors and consultants). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the parties do not intend for this Section 5.8 to
create any rights or obligations except between the parties hereto. No
Continuing Employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary,
including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other Person not a
party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim against Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates under this
Section 5.8.

Section 5.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Boards of
Directors shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and
Parent shall promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the conditions to the
other partys obligation to consummate the Merger set forth in Article VI not
being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being materially
delayed;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.10 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with,
any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to
the party receiving such notice.

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company
agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any present
(as of the Effective Time) or former officer, director or employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in
the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries disclosed in Section 5.11(a) of the Company Disclosure

 



\- 54 -  Letter shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect, and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy,"
in either case of at least the same coverage and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_   _further_ , that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 250% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 250%
of such last annual premium. With the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and
conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
that Parent shall have no obligation to consent to the purchase of any such
tail policy if it costs more than 250% of such last annual premium. If such
tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, (i) Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation and (ii) no party shall have any obligation to
purchase or maintain any other insurance pursuant to this Section 5.11.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 

(d) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether
pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each

 



\- 55 -  such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

Section 5.12 _Rule_ _ _ _16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall adopt such resolutions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any public announcement without the prior consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except as may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system. Parent and the Company agree that the press
release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a
joint release of Parent and the Company.

 

Section 5.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 5.15 _Nasdaq_ _Quotation_. The Company agrees to use reasonable
best efforts to continue the quotation of the Shares on NASDAQ during the term
of this Agreement.

Section 5.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. Until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the Effective
Time, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in (but
not control) the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against
the Company and/or its officers or directors relating to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not settle
any such litigation without Parents prior written consent, except for any
settlement that (a) does not (i) include an admission of liability or guilt or
(ii) provide for any injunctive or equitable relief, other than any
supplemental disclosures approved by Parent pursuant to Section 5.5(a), (b)
includes a complete release of Parent and its Affiliates and (c) does not
result in the payment by Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any

further approval or adoption by the stockholders that previously rendered such
approval without such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct
or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the

of the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered

_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders that previously rendered
such approval without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right
or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of

shall be deemed a Share for the purposes of this Agreement following
such Transfer. (c) " _Transfer_ " means, with respect to any security, the direct or
indirect assignment, sale, transfer, tender, exchange, pledge, hypothecation,
or the grant, creation or suffrage of a Lien upon, or the gift, grant or
placement in trust, or the Constructive Sale or other disposition of such
security (including transfers by testamentary or intestate succession, by

law) or any right, title or interest therein (including any right or power to
vote to which the holder thereof may be entitled, whether such right or power
is granted by proxy or otherwise), or the record or beneficial ownership
thereof.

 

2. _Transfer and Voting Restrictions_. 

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and expiring on the Expiration Date (as defined in
Section 7), Stockholder shall not, except in connection with the Merger,
Transfer or suffer a Transfer of any of the Shares. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 2(a) shall not prohibit a
Transfer of the Shares by Stockholder (i) to any Person who is a family member
of Stockholder (as the term "family member" is defined by Form S-8 promulgated
under the Securities Act (or any successor or comparable form)), (ii) upon
the death of Stockholder, (iii) pursuant to any written trading plan in effect
on the date of this Agreement intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, (iv) to an Affiliate of Stockholder, (v) that
results from the withholding by the Company, or sale by Stockholder, to the
extent necessary to cover Taxes incurred upon (1) the exercise and settlement
of any Company SAR of Stockholder that otherwise would expire in accordance
with its terms prior to the Expiration Date, or (2) the vesting of any
Company RSU of Stockholder prior to the Expiration Date, or (vi) to any person
or entity if and to the extent required by any non-consensual legal order, by
divorce decree or similar Law; _provided_ , that a Transfer referred to in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this sentence shall be permitted only if, as a
precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by
all of the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) Except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or by order of a court
of competent jurisdiction, Stockholder will not knowingly or intentionally
commit any act that would reasonably be expected to restrict or affect
Stockholders legal power, authority and right to vote any of the Shares.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for this Agreement
and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Stockholder shall not enter into
any voting agreement with any Person with respect to any of the Shares, grant
any Person any proxy (revocable or irrevocable) or power of attorney with
respect to any of the Shares, deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust or
otherwise enter into any agreement or arrangement with any Person limiting or
affecting Stockholders legal power, authority or right to vote any of the
Shares in favor of the approval of the Proposed Transaction (as such term is
defined in Section 3).

(c) In furtherance of this Agreement, and concurrently herewith,
Stockholder shall and hereby does authorize the Company or the Companys
counsel to notify the Companys transfer agent that there is a stop transfer
order with respect to all of the Shares during the time this Agreement is in
effect. At the request of Parent, Stockholder shall cause to be provided to
Parent evidence of such stop transfer order.

 



2 3. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. 

 

(a) Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of the stockholders of
the Company called, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on
every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company, Stockholder (in Stockholders capacity as such) shall appear at the
meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be present thereat for purposes of
establishing a quorum and, to the extent not voted by the Persons appointed as
proxies pursuant to this Agreement, vote (i) in favor of the adoption and
approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the other
transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the " _Proposed Transaction_
"), (ii) against the approval or adoption of any proposal made in opposition
to, or in competition with, the Proposed Transaction, and (iii) against any
Acquisition Proposal or any other action that could reasonably be expected to
impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the
consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Stockholder to vote or otherwise
consent to any amendment to the Merger Agreement or the taking of any action
that would result in the amendment, modification or a waiver of a provision
therein, in any such case, in a manner that decreases the amount or changes
the form of the Merger Consideration. Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 3(a), Stockholder shall not be restricted from voting in favor of,
against or abstaining with respect to any other matter presented to
the stockholders of the Company.

(b) If Stockholder is the beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of
any of the Shares, Stockholder agrees to take all actions necessary to cause
the record holder and any nominees to vote all of the Shares in accordance
with Section 3(a).

 

4. _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_. 

 

(a) Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints, until the Expiration Date,
Parent and each of its executive officers or other designees (the "
_Proxyholders_ "), as Stockholders proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full
power of substitution and re-substitution), and grants to the Proxyholders
full authority, for and in the name, place and stead of Stockholder, to vote
the Shares, to instruct nominees or record holders to vote the Shares, or
grant a consent or approval in respect of the Shares solely in accordance with
Section 3.

 

(b) Stockholder hereby revokes any proxies heretofore given by Stockholder
in respect of the Shares and agrees to execute any further agreement or form
reasonably necessary or appropriate to confirm and effectuate the grant of the
proxy contained herein.

 

(c) Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
Section 4 is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the
duties of Stockholder under this Agreement. Stockholder hereby further affirms
that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest, is intended to be
irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 78.355 of the NRS,
and may under no circumstances be revoked. The irrevocable proxy granted by
Stockholder herein is a durable power of attorney and shall survive
the dissolution, bankruptcy or incapacity of Stockholder.

 



3 (d) The Proxyholders may not exercise this irrevocable proxy on any
matter except as provided above. Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other
matters.

(e) Parent may terminate this proxy at any time by written notice to
Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
proxy shall automatically terminate upon the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7\.

 

5. _Action in Stockholder Capacity Only_. Stockholder is entering into this Agreement solely in Stockholders capacity as a record holder and beneficial owner, as applicable, of Shares and not in Stockholders capacity as a director or officer of the Company. Nothing herein shall limit or affect Stockholders ability to act as an officer or director of the Company. 

6. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

(a) (i) Stockholder is the beneficial or record owner of the Shares
indicated on the signature page of this Agreement free and clear of any and
all Liens; and (ii) Stockholder does not beneficially own any securities of
the Company other than the Shares set forth on the signature page of this
Agreement.

 

(b) As of the date hereof and for so long as this Agreement remains in
effect (including as of the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, which,
for purposes of this Agreement, includes any adjournment or postponement
thereof), except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Stockholder has full
power and authority to (i) make, enter into and carry out the terms of this
Agreement and to grant the irrevocable proxy as set forth in Section 4; and
(ii) vote all of the Shares in the manner set forth in this Agreement without
the consent or approval of, or any other action on the part of, any other
Person (including any Governmental Entity), except for any such consent,
approval or action that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially impair Stockholders ability to perform Stockholders obligations
under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Stockholder has not entered into any voting agreement (other than this
Agreement) with any Person with respect to any of the Shares, granted any
Person any proxy (revocable or irrevocable) or power of attorney with respect
to any of the Shares, deposited any of the Shares in a voting trust or entered
into any arrangement or agreement with any Person limiting or affecting
Stockholders legal power, authority or right to vote the Shares on any
matter.

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, constitutes
a valid and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder
in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

 



4 (d) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Stockholder do not and will not require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except for any such consent, approval, authorization,
permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or
obtain, individually or in the aggregate, has not and would not materially
impair Stockholders ability to perform Stockholders obligations under this
Agreement.

 

7. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect whatsoever as of the earlier of (a) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been validly terminated pursuant to the terms of Article VII thereof or (b) the Effective Time (the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided, however,_ that (i) Section 8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve Stockholder from any liability for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement prior to such termination. 

8. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except

waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by such
party. No failure or delay of either party in exercising any right or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to
the Corporation as provided above in this section.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

 _Section 1._ _Limitation of Liability_. No person shall be liable to the
Corporation for any loss or damage suffered by it on account of any action
taken or omitted to be taken by him as a director or officer of the
Corporation if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation or, with
respect to any criminal matter, had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

_Section 2._ _Action Other Than by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The
Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
whether external or internal to the

 



-9-  Corporation, (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent (all such persons being referred to
hereafter as an "Agent") of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he is
not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person is liable pursuant to NRS 78.138, did not act in
good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was unlawful.

 

 _Section 3_. _Action by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The Corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit brought by or
in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason
of the fact that he is or was an Agent (as defined in Section 2)
against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys fees
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138
or acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to
which such person shall have been adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable to the
Corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the Corporation, unless and
only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or
other court of competent jurisdiction shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which the court shall deem proper.

_Section 4_. _Indemnification Against Expenses of Successful Party_.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article VIII, to the extent that
an Agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to Section 2 or 3 of this Article VIII or
in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation shall
indemnify him against expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense.

 

 _Section 5_. _Advances of Expenses_. Except as limited by Section 6 of this
Article VIII, expenses incurred in defending or investigating any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation shall be paid by the Corporation in advance
of the final disposition of such matter, if the Board of Directors authorizes
such payments and Agent undertakes to repay such amount in the event that it
is ultimately determined, as provided herein, that such person is not entitled
to indemnification under Article VIII. The provisions of this Section 5 of
this Article VIII do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to
which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled
under any contract or otherwise by law.

_Section 6_. _Right of Agent to Indemnification Upon Application; Procedure
Upon Application_. Any requests for indemnification under Sections 2, 3 or 4,
or advance under Section 5 of this Article VIII, shall be acted upon promptly
and in any event within 45 days, upon the written request of the Agent. In
the event no quorum of disinterested directors is obtainable, the Board of
Directors shall promptly direct that independent legal counsel shall decide
whether the Agent acted in a manner as to justify the Corporations not
indemnifying or making an advance to the Agent. The right to indemnification
or advances as granted by this Article VIII shall be enforceable by the Agent
in any court of competent jurisdiction if no disposition of such claim is
made within 45 days. The Agents expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part,
in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.

 

 _Section 7_. _Other Rights and Remedies_. The indemnification and advancement
of expenses provided by this Article VIII or ordered by a court shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Agent seeking indemnification
may be entitled under the Articles of Incorporation or any Bylaw, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, court order or otherwise,
both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, since it is the policy of the Corporation
that indemnification of Agents shall be made to the fullest extent permitted
by law, except that indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant

 



-10-  to Section 3 of this Article VIII or for the advancement of expenses made
pursuant to Section 5 of this Article VIII, may not be made to or on behalf of
any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that the
directors or officers acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct,
fraud or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of
action. The indemnification provided by this Article shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. All rights to
indemnification under this Article shall be deemed to be provided by a
contract between the Corporation and the Agent who serves in such capacity at
any time while these Bylaws and other relevant provisions of NRS Chapter 78
(the "General Corporation Law") of the State of Nevada and other applicable
law, if any, are in effect. Any repeal or modification thereof shall not
affect any rights or obligations then existing.

_Section 8_.  _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Agent against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out
of his status as to such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power
to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article.

 

 _Section 9_. _Indemnity Fund_. Upon resolution passed by the Board, the
Corporation may establish a trust or other designated account, grant a
security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter
of credit), to ensure the payment of certain of its obligations arising under
this Article and/or agreements which may be entered into between the
Company and its officers and directors from time to time.

_Section 10_. _Constituent Corporations_. For the purposes of this
Article, references to "the Corporation" include all constituent corporations
absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving
corporation, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such a
constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting
or surviving corporation as he would had he served such constituent
corporation in the same capacity.

 

 _Section 11_. _Other Enterprises, Fines, and Serving at Corporation_ __ _s
Request_. For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprise" is
Sections 2 and 10 shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines"
shall include any excise taxes assessed a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation"

interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article. 

_Section 12_. _Indemnification of Other Persons_. The provisions of this
Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any
person who is not an Agent (as defined in Section 1), but whom the Corporation
has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Nevada or otherwise. The Corporation may, in
its sole discretion, indemnify an employee, trustee or other agent as
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada. The
Corporation shall indemnify an employee, trustee or other agent where required
by law.

 

 _Section 13_. _Savings Clause_. If this Article or any portion thereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Agent against expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether internal or external,
including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by or in the
right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable
portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other
applicable law.

_Section 14._ _Effect of Amendment_. No amendment, modification or repeal of
this Article or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or
impair the right of any past, present or future Agent to be indemnified by the
Corporation, nor the obligation of the Corporation to indemnify any such
Agent under and in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising, in whole or in part, from a state of facts existing
on the date of, or relating to matters occurring prior to, such amendment,
modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be
asserted.
