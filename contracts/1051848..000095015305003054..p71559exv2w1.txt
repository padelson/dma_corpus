provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

                  SECTION 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS;
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

                           (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Company in effect at the Effective Time will be amended in its entirety at the
Effective Time to read as set forth in Exhibit B hereto and shall be the

or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

                           (b) The officers and directors of Sub at the
Effective Time shall automatically, and without further action, be the officers

                  SECTION 1.5 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the
Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Constituent Corporations:

                           (a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable membership unit of the Surviving Company and shall constitute the
only equity interests in the Surviving Company outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time.

                           (b) All shares of Company Capital Stock that are held
in the treasury of the Company shall automatically be canceled and retired and

be delivered in exchange therefor.

                           (c) Any shares of Company Capital Stock owned by
Buyer, Sub, or any other Subsidiary of Buyer, directly or indirectly, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no Merger

<PAGE>



1.5(b) and (c)), together with the Company Stock Options and the Company Warrant
shall immediately cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and
retired, shall cease to exist and shall be converted into solely the right to
receive, in the aggregate, an amount of cash equal to $170,500,000 plus or
minus, as applicable, the Estimated Adjustment Amount (as defined below),
without any interest thereon (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8, the
"Merger Consideration"), to be distributed in accordance with Sections 1.5(e),
1.5(f), 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8. At the Effective Time, each holder of Company Capital
Stock and Company Stock Options and the holder of the Company Warrant shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such issued and outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock (including, without limitation, the right to vote) Company
Stock Options, the Company Warrant, or any shares of Company Capital Stock
underlying the Company Stock Options or the Company Warrant, except in each case
for the right to receive such holder's pro rata portion of the Merger
Consideration as set forth herein.

                           (e) Each issued and outstanding share of Company
Capital Stock shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash

the aggregate exercise price of the Company Stock Options and the Company
Warrant, plus (C) the total amount of principal and interest due and payable

Closing pursuant to the Promissory Note, dated January 17, 2005, executed by
Louis Mancini in the original principal amount of $150,000, divided by (ii) the
sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time, but excluding shares described in Sections
1.5(b) and 1.5(c), plus (B) the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital
Stock subject to issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Options and the Company
Warrant (such sum is referred to herein as the "Fully-Diluted Number" and such
quotient is referred to herein as the "Per Share Amount"; provided, however,
that the Mancini Payable Amount shall be deducted from the portion of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to Louis Mancini.

                           (f) Each Company Stock Option and the Company Warrant
shall be converted into the right to receive, with respect to each share of
Company Capital Stock issuable pursuant to such Company Stock Option or Company
Warrant, the Per Share Amount, less any amounts that would have been payable by
the holder of such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant to the Company, or
required to be withheld by the Company, upon the exercise of such Company Stock
Option or Company Warrant with respect to such share of Company Capital Stock.

                           (g) The "Estimated Adjustment Amount" may be a
positive or negative number and shall include:

                           (h) Optionee Amount. At the Closing, each Seller
shall be entitled to such Seller's pro rata portion of the Optionee Amount. The
"Optionee Amount" means an amount equal to 39% multiplied by the sum of (i) the
amount of cash to be paid to the holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to
Section 1.5(f) at the Closing (or, in the case of an adjustment made pursuant to
Section 1.8, the amount of the adjustment (whether positive or negative) to the
amount of Merger Consideration paid to the holders of Company Stock Options
pursuant to Section 1.8) and (ii) the amounts withheld from such amounts
pursuant to Section 1.5(f) or Section 1.7.

                  SECTION 1.6 PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.

                           (a) Escrow Amount. At the Closing, Buyer shall
deposit $6,000,000 of the Merger Consideration that would have otherwise been
payable to the holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Stock Options and the
Company Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the "Escrow Amount") in
an account with the Bank of New York (the "Escrow Agent") to be held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of an Escrow Agreement, substantially
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, to be entered into as of the Closing
by and among Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Seller Representative (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy any purchase price
adjustments pursuant to Section 1.8 or claims for indemnification by Buyer or
any other Indemnitees determined to be due and payable pursuant to Article VI
hereof in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall be
maintained and used strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Escrow Amount that shall be withheld
with respect to each share of Company Capital Stock (including each share of
Company Capital Stock that would have been issuable under each Company Stock
Option and the Company Warrant had they been fully exercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time) shall equal the quotient of (i) the Escrow Amount divided
by (ii) the Fully-Diluted Number (such quotient is referred to herein as the
"Escrow Per Share Amount").

                           (b) Exchange of Certificates; Payment of Merger
Consideration. At the Closing:

                                    (i) each Seller shall deliver to Buyer any
and all (as applicable) (i) certificates representing the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Seller, duly endorsed in blank or
with duly executed stock powers attached and (ii) the Company Warrant held by
such Seller; and

                                    (ii) Buyer shall pay to each holder of
Company Stock Options, and to each Seller who has delivered certificates, stock
powers, or the Company Warrant as provided in Section 1.6(b)(i) (and has made
such certificates, powers and Company Warrant available for inspection no later
than two business days prior to the Closing), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the accounts designated by the Seller Representative not less
than two business days prior to the Closing, an amount



                                       4
<PAGE>


equal to (A) the amount payable to such Seller pursuant to Sections 1.5(e)
and/or 1.5(f), and 1.5(h) as applicable, less (B) the product of (I) the Escrow
Per Share Amount multiplied by (II) the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock (including, with respect to each Company Stock Option and the Company
Warrant, each share of Company Capital Stock that would have been issuable
thereunder as of the Effective Time) held by such Seller. Any Seller who has not
provided all of the certificates, powers, or warrant required by Section
1.6(b)(i) above available for inspection not later than two business days prior
to the Closing shall be paid by Buyer within two business days following such
Buyer's receipt of the documents required by Section 1.6(b)(i) above in
satisfactory form.

                  SECTION 1.7 WITHHOLDING. The Company and each Seller authorize
Buyer to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Company Stock Options such amounts as the
Company or Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment or exercise of a Company Stock Option under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law, or any option agreement between the Company and such Seller. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Stock Option in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Buyer.

                  SECTION 1.8 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. In addition to the
adjustments to be made to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(g),
following the Closing, the parties will adjust the Merger Consideration as
follows:

                           (a) Working Capital Adjustment.

                                    (i) "Working Capital" means, as of the
Closing Date, the amount by which the sum of the (A) cash and cash equivalents
after subtracting $1,000,000, (B) accounts receivable, (C) inventory (except for
account #1310 titled "Volume Discounts/Coop - Reserve"), and (D) prepaid
expenses and other current assets (excluding any assets relating to Taxes) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries exceeds the sum of the (x) accounts payable and
(y) current accrued expenses (which shall (I) exclude any Indebtedness and
accrued interest and Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the Company
Transaction Expenses Notice and (II) in the case of Taxes, be limited to the
accrued tax liability net of any current benefit from any tax assets) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, all as determined in a manner consistent with the
Company's past practices, the Company Balance Sheet, and without taking into
account any adjustments relating to the Merger, including any purchase
accounting adjustments.

                                    (ii) As promptly as practicable following
the Closing, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing, Buyer and its
representatives will prepare and submit to the Seller Representative a statement
(the "Final Statement") setting forth the Working Capital (the "Final Working
Capital") (including detail of the components of Working Capital as they would
appear on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in a manner
consistent with the Company Balance Sheet)



                                       5
<PAGE>



determined in a manner consistent with the Company's past practices, the Company
Balance Sheet, and without taking into account any adjustments relating to the
Merger, including any purchase accounting adjustments. The Final Statement shall
set forth any adjustment to the Merger Consideration that needs to be made as a
result of any difference between the Final Working Capital and the Estimated
Working Capital pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(iii), as well as any adjustment to
the Optionee Amount as a result of such adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

                                    (iii) If the Final Working Capital less the
Estimated Working Capital is a positive number, the Merger Consideration will be
increased by the amount of such difference and the Optionee Amount will be
increased by a correlative amount (calculated in accordance with Section
1.5(h)). If the Final Working Capital less the Estimated Working Capital is a
negative number, the Merger Consideration will be decreased by the amount of
such difference and the Optionee Amount will be decreased by a correlative
amount (calculated in accordance with Section 1.5(h)).

                           (b) If the Seller Representative disputes Buyer's
calculation of the Final Working Capital as set forth in the Final Statement,
the Seller Representative will notify Buyer in writing setting forth its
objections in detail within 20 days after delivery of the Final Statement. If
the Seller Representative does not so notify Buyer within such 20-day period,
the Seller Representative, on behalf the Sellers, will be deemed to have
conclusively accepted the Final Statement and the Final Working Capital. If the
Seller Representative does so notify Buyer, Buyer and the Seller Representative
will endeavor in good faith to resolve any dispute over the calculation. Each
party will cooperate with the other party in the determination of the
appropriate calculations and any adjustment in the Merger Consideration to be
made after the Closing Date, including allowing the other party and its
representatives reasonable access after the Closing to the books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to the execution of reasonable
confidentiality agreements. If Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to
resolve any such dispute within 30 days after the delivery of the Seller
Representative's notice of the dispute to Buyer, such dispute may, upon the
request of Buyer or the Seller Representative, be submitted to a
nationally-recognized accounting firm in the United States as is mutually
acceptable to Buyer and the Seller Representative (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"), which will resolve all such disputes within 30 days from their
submission. Each of Buyer and the Seller Representative will be entitled to
submit a proposal for a revised Final Statement (each such proposal, a "Proposed
Statement"), and the Independent Accounting Firm will be permitted to select one
of the two Proposed Statements, but will be unable to resolve the dispute in any
manner other than the selection of one of the two Proposed Statements. The
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm will be final and binding upon
Buyer, Sub, the Seller Representative and the Sellers. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by the non-prevailing party, and
if the non-prevailing party is the Sellers, up to $50,000 of such amount may be
paid by the Sellers by release of an equal portion of the Escrow Amount to the
Independent Accounting Firm, and any remaining balance shall be paid by the
Sellers, pro rata.

                           (c) Once the calculation of the Final Working Capital
has been agreed upon by Buyer and the Seller Representative or any dispute with
regard thereto has been resolved in accordance with this Section 1.8:

                                    (i) In the event of an increase in the
Merger Consideration and a correlative increase in the Optionee Amount to be
made pursuant to this Section 1.8, Buyer will pay to each Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in the amounts and to the accounts
designated by the Seller Representative, its or his respective pro rata amount
of (A) the increase in Merger Consideration, and (B) the increase in the
Optionee Amount resulting from the increase in Merger Consideration.

                                    (ii) Any decrease in the Merger
Consideration and correlative decrease in the Optionee Amount to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.8 will be paid to Buyer from the Escrow Amount and
will also reduce the Escrow Per Share Amount on a pro rata basis. If the
deduction in the Merger Consideration and the Optionee Amount to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.8 exceeds the Escrow Amount, each Seller, severally,
shall pay his or its pro rata share of such shortfall to Buyer.

                  SECTION 1.9 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON
STOCK. All amounts paid and to be paid to Sellers in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to constitute full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to (a) the shares of Company Capital Stock; (b) the Company Stock Options and
the Company Warrant; and (c) the shares of Company Capital Stock underlying such
Company Stock Options and the Company Warrant.

                  SECTION 1.10 CLOSING OF COMPANY TRANSFER BOOKS. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no
transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing
shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the Surviving Company or the
Buyer, such certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article I.

                  SECTION 1.11 LOST CERTIFICATES. If any certificate
representing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Buyer, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Buyer may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with respect to
such certificate, Buyer will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the amounts to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
this Article I.

                  SECTION 1.12 FURTHER ASSURANCES. If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in, to or under
any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of
either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out



                                       7
<PAGE>



the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Company and its proper officers
and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on
behalf of either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as may
be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving
Company's right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 1.13 CLOSING. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") and all actions specified in this
Agreement to occur at the Closing shall take place at the offices of Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher LLP, 1801 California Street, Suite 4200, Denver, Colorado at
10:00 a.m. local time, on the later of (A) the date that is two days after the
date on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII (such
conditions, the "Closing Conditions") has been fulfilled or waived (if
permissible), (B) December 19, 2005, or (C) at such other time and place as
Buyer and the Company shall agree(the "Closing Date"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the last of the Closing Conditions is satisfied on a Friday, then
Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the Closing on the
following Monday, but if Buyer, in its sole discretion, deems that a Closing on
that time frame is not reasonably feasible, then the Closing shall take place on
the second Monday following the satisfaction of the Closing Conditions.
Furthermore, if the last of the Closing Conditions is satisfied on a Saturday or
Sunday, then the Closing will occur on the second Monday following such
satisfaction.

                           (a) Not less than two days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall prepare and submit to Buyer a statement (the "Preliminary
Statement") setting forth an estimate of the Working Capital (the "Estimated
Working Capital") (including detail of the components of Working Capital as they
would appear on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in a manner
consistent with the Company Balance Sheet) determined in a manner consistent
with the Company's past practices, the Company Balance Sheet, and without taking
into account any adjustments relating to the Merger, including any purchase
accounting adjustments. At the Closing, the parties will calculate the
difference between the Estimated Working Capital and $22,000,000 (the "Target
Working Capital"). Such difference shall be the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment. If the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Target Working Capital,
then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be a positive number equal
to the amount of such excess. If the Estimated Working Capital is less than the
Target Working Capital, then the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment shall be a
negative number equal to the amount of such shortfall.

                           (b) On the day prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a written notice (the "Company Transaction Expenses
Notice") setting forth and representing in good faith to Buyer the aggregate
Company Transaction Expenses, together with an itemization and description of
such Company Transaction Expenses in reasonable detail and final invoices from
the relevant payees in respect thereof. "Company Transaction Expenses" means any
and all out of pocket expenses



                                       8
<PAGE>



incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent such expenses remain
unpaid as of the Closing, including to the extent payable by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company, the fees of legal advisors, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors, valuation firms or similar professionals. On the
Closing Date, Buyer, on behalf of the Company, shall pay the Company Transaction
Expenses reflected on the Company Transaction Expenses Notice to the applicable
professionals and other payees reflected on such notice.

                           (c) On the day prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver a written notice (the "Debt Amount Notice") setting forth and
representing in good faith to Buyer the total Debt Amount, together with an
itemization and description of such Debt Amount. "Debt Amount" means all
Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries and all accrued interest related
to such Indebtedness, including Indebtedness associated with the Credit
Agreement listed in Section 3.11(b) of the Company Letter (the "Company Credit
Facility"), the Senior Subordinated Loan Agreement listed in Section 3.11(b) of
the Company Letter (the "Senior Subordinated Loan Agreement"), and leases and
similar arrangements required to be capitalized in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), other than those capitalized
real estate leases set forth in Section 1.13 of the Company Letter, together
with any breakage costs, prepayment penalties or similar fees or amounts that
would be incurred by the immediate payment of such Indebtedness.

                           (d) On the Closing Date and simultaneously with the
Closing, Buyer, on behalf of the Company, shall pay or otherwise discharge all
Indebtedness and other amounts due and payable under, and terminate the Company
Credit Facility and the Senior Subordinated Loan Agreement. Concurrent with such
payment or discharge, the Company shall obtain (i) releases of all guarantees by
the Company's Subsidiaries securing the Indebtedness and other obligations under
the Company Credit Facility or other Indebtedness, and (ii) releases of all
Encumbrances on the assets, properties and capital stock of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries securing the Indebtedness under the Company Credit Facility.
At the Closing, the Company shall provide evidence in writing satisfactory to
Buyer of the Company's performance of the covenants set forth in this Section
1.13(d), including payoff letters in customary form and UCC-3 termination
statements and other customary Encumbrance-release documentation in connection
with the release of guarantees and the release of Encumbrances on the assets,
properties and capital stock of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

                           (e) Between the time of delivery of any notice
required to be given to Buyer pursuant to Sections (a), (b), or (c) of this
Section 1.13 and the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate to ensure
the accuracy of such notices.

                           (f) For avoidance of doubt, downward adjustments to
the Merger Consideration made pursuant to Section 1.8, or any Losses incurred as
a result of any inaccuracy in the Company Transaction Expenses Notice or the
Debt Amount Notice shall be made by a claim against the Escrow Amount and shall
be made without regard to



                                       9
<PAGE>



the indemnification provisions of Article VI (including the Deductible and the
Cap) of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                                OF BUYER AND SUB

                  Buyer and Sub represent and warrant to the Company and the
Sellers as follows:

                  SECTION 2.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of Buyer
and Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its place of incorporation and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.

                  SECTION 2.2 AUTHORITY. On or prior to the date of this
Agreement, the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and Sub have declared the
Merger advisable and have approved and adopted this Agreement in accordance with
the DGCL. Each of Buyer and Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and Sub and the
consummation by Buyer and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action (including all Board action)
on the part of Buyer and Sub, subject to the filing of appropriate Certificate
of Merger as required by the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and Sub, and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the Sellers) this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Buyer and Sub enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

                  SECTION 2.3 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATION. Except for
the filings, registrations, authorizations, consents and approvals described in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the following sentence of this Section 2.3, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will
not, result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give to others a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or result in the loss of a benefit under, any
provision of (a) the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of Buyer, each
as amended to date, (b) the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Sub,
each as amended to date, (c) any material contract, agreement or arrangement to
which Buyer or Sub is a party or by which any of their respective assets are
bound, or (d) any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, or material ordinance,
rule or regulation, applicable to Buyer or Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets. No filing or registration with, or authorization, consent
or approval of, any domestic (federal and state), foreign or supranational
court, commission, governmental body, regulatory agency, authority or



                                       10
<PAGE>



tribunal (a "Governmental Entity") is required by or with respect to Buyer or
Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer or
Sub or is necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) in connection, or in
compliance, with the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is
qualified to do business, or (iii) such filings and consents as may be required
under any environmental, health or safety law or regulation pertaining to any
notification, disclosure or required approval triggered by the Merger or by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                  Each representation and warranty set forth below is qualified
by any exception or disclosures set forth in the letter dated the date hereof
and delivered on the date hereof by the Company to Buyer, which relates to this
Agreement and is designated therein as the Company Letter (the "Company
Letter"), which exceptions specifically reference the Sections to be qualified.
In all other respects, each representation and warranty set out in this Article
III is not qualified in any way whatsoever, will not merge on the Closing, or by
reason of the execution and delivery of any agreement, document or instrument at
the Closing, will remain in force on and after the Closing Date, is given with
the intention that liability is not confined to breaches discovered before
Closing, is separate and independent and is not limited by reference to any
other representation or warranty or any other provision of this Agreement, and
is made and given with the intention of inducing Buyer and Sub to enter into
this Agreement. The Company represents and warrants to Buyer and Sub as follows:

                  SECTION 3.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER.

                           (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is (i) a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation as set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the
Company Letter, and has full corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted
and (ii) duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and
is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for any such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Material Adverse Change" or "Material Adverse Effect" mean, when used with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any change or effect that is
or could reasonably be expected (as far as can be foreseen at the time) to be
materially adverse to the business, operations, properties, assets, results of
operations or the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.




                                       11
<PAGE>
                  (b) The Company has heretofore furnished to Buyer a complete
and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries. Such certificates of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational documents. The
transfer books and minute books of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
have been made available for inspection by Buyer prior to the date hereof are
true and complete.

            SECTION 3.2 CAPITAL STRUCTURE.

                  (a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 20,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 80,000 shares of
Company Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, (i) 10,024.018 shares of Company
Common Stock are issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no shares of Company
Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding, (iii) no shares of Company Common
Stock are held in the treasury of the Company, (iv) 1,126.769 shares of Company
Common Stock are reserved for future issuance pursuant to the Company's 2003
Stock Option Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan"), and (v) 228.00 shares of
Company Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to a warrant to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock issued by the Company (the "Company Warrant"). On
the date hereof, the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
held of record by the Persons and in the amounts with the corresponding
certificate numbers set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Letter. Section
3.2(a) of the Company Letter sets forth, for each Subsidiary of the Company, the
amount of its authorized capital stock, the amount of its outstanding capital
stock and the record owners of its outstanding capital stock. There are no
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or capital
stock of any Subsidiary of the Company that are not listed in Section 3.2(a) of
the Company Letter. As of the Closing Date, there will be no shares of Company
Capital Stock or capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company outstanding
other than as listed in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Letter.

                  (b) Section 3.2 (b) of the Company Letter contains a correct
and complete list as of the date of this Agreement of each outstanding option to
purchase shares of Company Capital Stock issued under the Company Stock Option
Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Options"), including the holder, date of

any of its Subsidiaries grants licenses or other rights in or to use or practice
any rights under any Intellectual Property; or

party that is used in connection with the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries other than any license agreements for commercially available
software applications used generally in the operations of the Company and its

fees (per agreement) of no more than $25,000.

                  (c) Each Material Contract is a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable. Except as set forth
in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Letter, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (or to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto) is in
default under any Material Contract, and the Company has not received any notice
of cancellation or default of any such Material Contract. Each Material Contract
is in full force and effect, and no event has occurred which, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default, event of
default or other breach by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries which would
entitle the other party to such Material Contract to terminate the same or
declare a default or event of default thereunder; and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in receipt of any claim of default under any Material
Contract.

            SECTION 3.12 ERISA.

                  (a) Each Company Plan is listed in Section 3.12(a) of the
Company Letter. With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has made
available to Buyer a true and correct copy of (i) the three most recent annual
reports (Form 5500) filed with the applicable government agency, (ii) each such
Company Plan that has been reduced to writing and all amendments thereto, (iii)
each trust agreement, insurance contract or administration agreement relating to
each such Company Plan, (iv) a written summary of each unwritten Company Plan,
(v) the most recent summary plan description or other written explanation of
each Company Plan provided to participants, (vi) the most recent actuarial
report or valuation relating to a Company Plan subject to Title IV of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (vii) the
most recent determination letter or opinion letter and request therefore, if
any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Plan intended to be qualified
under section 401(a) of the Code, (viii) any request for a determination
currently pending before the IRS, (ix) all correspondence with the IRS, the
Department of Labor, or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any
outstanding controversy or with respect to any matter that has been resolved in
the previous three years and (x) all forms and certificate samples used to
comply with Sections 4980, 9801 and 9802 of the Code. Each Company Plan complies
in form and has been operated in material compliance with ERISA, the Code and
all other Applicable Law. Except as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company
Letter, no "reportable event" (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has
occurred with respect to any Company Plan for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its ERISA Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) has withdrawn from any
Company Multiemployer Plan (as hereinafter defined) and would not incur any
withdrawal liability if it withdrew from all Company Multiemployer Plans on the
date of this Agreement. No action has been taken, or is currently being
considered, to terminate or withdraw from any Company Plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA and there is no reason to believe the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation would initiate the termination of any such Plan.


                                       22
<PAGE>

No Company Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived.

                  (b) Except as listed in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Letter
and except for routine contributions due and owing, with respect to the Company
Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate or Company Plan fiduciary could be subject to any material
liability under the terms of such Company Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other
Applicable Law. All Company Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be so qualified
through the issuance of a favorable determination letter or an opinion letter,
or a timely application for such determination is now pending and the Company is
not aware of any reason why any such Company Plan is not so qualified in
operation. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has been notified by any Company Multiemployer Plan that such Company
Multiemployer Plan is currently in reorganization or insolvency under and within
the meaning of Section 4241 or 4245 of ERISA or that such Company Multiemployer
Plan intends to terminate or has been terminated under Section 4041A of ERISA.
No event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances that
would result in an increase in the contributions required to be made to any
Company Multiemployer Plan by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate. Except as disclosed in Section 3.12(b) of the Company Letter,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide benefits after
termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required by
Section 4980B of the Code.

                  (c) As used herein, (i) "Company Plan" means a "pension plan"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (including a Company Multiemployer Plan)),
a "welfare plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or
oral bonus, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock, restricted stock, stock
appreciation right, holiday pay, vacation, severance, medical, dental, vision,
disability, death benefit, sick leave, fringe benefit, personnel policy,
insurance or other plan, program, agreement, arrangement or understanding, in
each case established or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its ERISA Affiliates or as to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates has contributed or otherwise may
have any liability, (ii) "Company Multiemployer Plan" means a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates is or has been obligated to
contribute or otherwise may have any liability, and (iii) "ERISA Affiliate"
means any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which would be
considered a single employer with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated under those sections or pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (d) Section 3.12(d) of the Company Letter contains a list of
all (i) severance and employment agreements with officers and employees of the
Company


                                       23

and each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate, (ii) severance programs
and policies of the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate
with or relating to its employees and (iii) plans, programs, agreements and
other arrangements of the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA
Affiliate with or relating to its employees containing change of control or
similar provisions.

                  (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e)of the Company
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement, contract or arrangement that could result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment, acceleration or enhancement of any benefit as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (f) There is no Company Plan that is subject to the laws of a
foreign government or jurisdiction.

                  (g) This Section 3.12 and Section 3.8 contain all of the
Company's representations and warranties as to any matter relating to ERISA, and
no other provision of this Agreement will be deemed to contain any
representations and warranties relating to such matters.

            SECTION 3.13 COMPLIANCE WITH WORKER SAFETY LAWS. The properties,
assets and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign

its Subsidiaries in each case which are in force as of the date hereof (the
"Insurance Policies"). The Company and its Subsidiaries have made any and all
payments required to maintain the Insurance Policies in full force and effect.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have not received notice of default under any
Insurance Policy and have not received written notice or, to the knowledge of
the Company, oral notice of any pending or threatened termination or
cancellation, coverage limitation or reduction or premium increase with respect
to any Insurance Policy.

            SECTION 3.15 LABOR MATTERS. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or labor contract
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any effort to organize any
employees of the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in any unfair labor practice with respect to any persons employed by or
otherwise performing services primarily for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Business Personnel"), and to the knowledge of the
Company, there is no unfair labor practice complaint or grievance filed against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any


                                       24
<PAGE>

agency or foreign law pending or threatened in writing with respect to the

material respect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all Applicable Laws relating to the employment of labor.

persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure, but excluding any
Copyrights or Patents that cover or protect any of the foregoing (collectively,
"Trade Secrets"), and (v) rights of publicity, privacy or related rights.

                  (b) Registered Intellectual Property. Section 3.16(b)(1) of

the process of being registered) or obtained in accordance with all applicable
legal requirements and is currently in compliance in all material respects with
all legal requirements (including the timely post-registration filing of
affidavits of use and incontestability and renewal applications) other than any
requirement that, if not satisfied, would not result in a cancellation of any

prior use of any Company Registered Mark by any third party that would confer
upon such third party superior rights in such Company Registered Mark. All
Company Registered Marks have been continuously used by the Company or one of

aware and which would be reasonably likely to cause (i) any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement and made by it to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect or (ii) any covenant, condition or agreement contained
in this Agreement and made by it not to be complied with or satisfied in all
material respects, (b) any failure of Buyer or the Company, as the

                                       40
<PAGE>

case may be, to comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, or (c)
any change or event which would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Buyer or the Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

     SECTION 5.7 TAXES.

     (a) Tax Returns. Buyer will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax
Returns of the Company that are due after the Effective Date. All such Tax
Returns covering periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be
prepared, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in accordance with past
custom and practice of the Company. Buyer will submit the federal income tax
return of the Company for the period ending on the Closing Date to the Seller
Representative for review and comment at least 30 days before the due date of
such Tax Return (including any extensions thereof), and agrees to consider, in
good faith, the comments on such Tax Return received from the Seller
Representative. Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer will neither
cause nor allow any Tax Return of the Company to be amended in a manner that
would result in any additional liability of the Sellers to the Buyer under
Article VI hereunder without the approval of the Seller Representative, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (b) Payment to Holders of Stock Options. The parties agree that for
purposes of Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations, the
payment to the holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.5(f)
hereunder shall be treated as having been made on the day following the Closing
Date. The parties shall report such payment consistent with this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.8 MINIMUM CASH ON HAND AT THE CLOSING. In order to ensure the
continuing operation of the business, at the Closing, the Company will have at
least $1,000,000 of cash on the Closing Date.

     SECTION 5.9 SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION.

     (a) In the event that there is a Final Decision with respect to all claims
in the litigation captioned "Murray's Discount Auto Stores, Inc. v. USRP Texas,
L.P., et al., Case No. 2002GH-10881, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois"
(the "Chicago Store Dispute") that occurs after the Closing, any cash payment
received by Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their respective affiliates
in connection with such Final Decision (the "Cash Settlement Amount") will be
treated as follows:

     (i) An amount equal to the legal costs and expenses incurred by Buyer, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective affiliates in connection with
investigating, defending, prosecuting, settling or satisfying the Chicago Store
Dispute after the Closing will be retained from the Cash Settlement Amount by
Buyer (the "Dispute Expenses"); and

                                       41
<PAGE>

     (ii) Any Cash Settlement Amount in excess of the Dispute Expenses shall be,
within 20 days after the receipt thereof by Buyer, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective affiliates, paid to the Sellers (in the amounts and to the
accounts designated by the Seller Representative), pro rata.

     (b) A "Final Decision" means a settlement agreement, decision, order,
judgment or decree of an arbitrator, mediator, or court of competent
jurisdiction that has been finally affirmed on appeal or that by lapse of time,
agreement or otherwise is no longer subject to appeal.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                    INDEMNITY

     SECTION 6.1. GENERAL SURVIVAL. The parties agree that, regardless of any
investigation made by the parties, the representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending at 5:00
p.m., New York time, on the same day of the month as the Closing in the month
that is fifteen months after the Closing Date (the "Indemnification Termination
Date"), except that (a) the representations and warranties in Section 3.9 and,
to the extent related to Taxes, Section 3.5, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement until ninety days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, if any, (b) the representations and
warranties in Section 3.18 shall survive until the third anniversary of the
Closing, (c) the representations and warranties in Section 3.2 (Capital
Structure) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement until the
fifth anniversary of the Closing.

     SECTION 6.2. INDEMNIFICATION.

     (a) Buyer Indemnification. Subject to Section 6.1, from and after the
Effective Time, Buyer, Sub and the Surviving Company and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, representatives and agents
(collectively the "Buyer Indemnitees") shall be indemnified and held harmless by
each Seller, who shall be liable severally (pro rata) and not jointly, from and
against and in respect of any and all Losses (as defined below) incurred by,
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, imposed upon or incurred by Buyer,
Sub, the Surviving Company or any other Buyer Indemnitee by reason of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Company's or any of such Seller's
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents (as hereinafter defined) to which it is a party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of this
Section 6.2 only, the representations and warranties of the Company regarding
the inventories of the Company as set forth in the Financial Statements shall be
read without regard to materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers.

     (b) Seller Indemnification. Subject to Section 6.1, from and after the
Effective Time, Sellers and their respective affiliates, officers, directors,
shareholders, representatives, agents, heirs and estates, as applicable
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees", and together with the Buyer
Indemnitees, each an "Indemnitee")

                                       42
<PAGE>

shall be indemnified and held harmless by Buyer, the Sub and the Surviving
Company, jointly and severally, from and against and in respect of any and all
Losses incurred by, resulting from, arising out of, relating to, imposed upon or
incurred by any Seller or any Seller Indemnitee by reason of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representations and warranties of Buyer or Sub contained in
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

     (c) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the term, "Losses" means
(A) any and all deficiencies, judgments, settlements, demands, claims, suits,
actions or causes of action, assessments, liabilities, losses, damages (but
excluding any consequential damages or the like), interest, fines and penalties,
and (B) costs, expenses (including reasonable legal, accounting and other costs
and expenses of professionals) incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, prosecuting, settling or satisfying any and all demands, claims,
actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments or
appeals, and in seeking indemnification therefor. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Transaction Documents" means, this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the certificates required to
be delivered pursuant to Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(c), 7.3(a), 7.3(c), and 7.3(d).

     (d) Limitations. Except as provided in the next sentence, no Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising under
this Section 6.2 until the aggregate amount of all Losses under all claims of
all Buyer Indemnitees for all such inaccuracies or breaches shall exceed
$1,500,000 (the "Deductible"), at which time only such Losses incurred in excess
of the Deductible shall be subject to indemnification. All amounts due to Buyer
Indemnitees related to Losses for (i) a breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties in Section 3.9, and to the extent related to
Taxes, Section 3.5 and (ii) a breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties in Section 3.2, shall not be subject to the provisions of this
Section 6.2(d) and shall be paid in full without any regard to the Deductible,
but shall be subject to the Cap as provided below.

(e)  Cap on Indemnification.

     (i) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
arising under this Section 6.2 to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
Losses paid to Buyer Indemnitees under this Section 6.2 exceed $13,000,000 (the
"Cap").

     (ii) The Cap shall not apply to: (A) any claims for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, or (B) any claims based on a breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations in Sections 3.1 (Organization, Standing and Power), 3.2 (Capital
Structure), and 3.3 (Authority). Each Seller's liability for indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2(a) for claims of the type described in clauses (A) and
(B), when combined with all other claims for which such Seller is liable for
indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, shall not exceed the amount of the
Merger Consideration, as finally adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8, received by
such Seller.

                                       43
<PAGE>

     SECTION 6.3. MANNER OF INDEMNIFICATION.

     (a) Claims of indemnification made under this Article VI (an
"Indemnification Claim"), may be made only in accordance with the provisions of
this Article VI and, if applicable, the Escrow Agreement. To provide a fund
against which a Buyer Indemnitee may first assert an Indemnification Claim, the
Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent in accordance with
Section 1.6.

     (b) If it is determined that a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to be
indemnified for Losses pursuant to Section 6.2(a), the obligation to pay the
amount of indemnification owing thereunder shall first be satisfied from the
Escrow Amount, and then by payment by each Seller pro rata. In the event an
Indemnification Claim arises and the amount of Loss in respect thereof has not
yet been determined, the corresponding portion of the Escrow Amount shall be
retained until the amount of Loss has been determined, and shall then be applied
or distributed as provided for in the Escrow Agreement.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any
Seller be liable with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of any other Seller contained in this Agreement or
any of the Transaction Documents.

     (d) If any payment is made from the Escrow Amount to any Buyer
Indemnitee(s) with respect to an Indemnification Claim resulting from, arising
out of or relating to an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty by any Seller (the "Affected Seller") contained in this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents, then the Seller Representative shall
promptly deliver to the Affected Seller a demand for contribution, and the
Affected Seller shall, within ten days after delivery of such demand, pay to
each other Seller, by wire transfer (upon receipt of written wire transfer
instructions of the recipient), an amount in cash equal such other Seller's
proportionate share of the excess of the amount of the payment made from the
Escrow Amount over the Affected Seller's pro rata share of such payment (the
"Contribution Amount"). For purposes of this Section 6.3(d), a Seller's
"proportionate share" of the Contribution Amount shall be an amount equal to the
product of the Contribution Amount times a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be such Seller's pro rata share and the denominator of which shall be the
aggregate pro rata shares of all of the Sellers other than such Affected Seller.
The obligations of each Affected Seller under this Section 6.3(d) are absolute
and unconditional and are not subject to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction or
defense of any kind and will not be terminated, released, discharged or in any
way affected with respect to any Affected Seller by any circumstance or
condition whatsoever that might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense. In the event any Affected Seller fails to make any payment to any other
Seller when due pursuant to this Section 6.3(d), such payment will bear interest
at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in the Wall Street
Journal, eastern edition, on the date such obligation becomes due) plus 3% or,
if less, the highest rate permitted by applicable law. If any suit or action is
instituted or attorneys are employed to collect any such payment or any part

                                       44
<PAGE>

thereof, such Affected Seller shall pay all costs of collection, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.

     (e) To the extent that any part of the Losses underlying an Indemnification
Claim would be covered by an "occurrence-based" (rather than a "claims
made-based") insurance policy of the Surviving Company, then Buyer, Sub or the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall be required to submit a claim for such
coverage to the relevant insurance carrier and to the extent such entity
actually receives payment of such claim, any claim under this Article VI shall
be reduced by such amount.

     SECTION 6.4 NOTICE OF CLAIMS.

     (a) Any Indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder shall give a notice (a
"Claim Notice") to the party from whom indemnification is sought (either the
Seller Representative (in the case of a Buyer Indemnitee) or Buyer (in the case
of a Seller Indemnitee), the "Indemnifying Party"), specifying in reasonable
detail the facts giving rise to any Indemnification Claim and shall include in
such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the
amount of such Indemnification Claim, and a reference to the provision of this
Agreement or any agreement, certificate or instrument executed pursuant hereto
or in connection herewith upon which such Indemnification Claim is based;
provided, that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity
by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought shall be
given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; and provided further, that
failure to give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such
failure.

     (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty days after the giving of any
Claim Notice pursuant hereto to provide such Indemnitee with notice that it
disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim
Notice (the "Disagreement Notice"). If a timely Disagreement Notice is not
received or to the extent an item is not objected to in the Disagreement Notice,
the Claim Notice shall be deemed to have been accepted and final and binding on
the parties, absent manifest error. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a timely
Disagreement Notice, the parties shall resolve such conflict in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 6.4(c).

     (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall have provided a Disagreement Notice,
the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the parties should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by
Buyer and the Seller Representative. In the event the parties shall fail to
reach an agreement within thirty days after the date on which the Indemnifying
Party provided a Disagreement Notice, the dispute shall be submitted to
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.6.

     SECTION 6.5. THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. If a Buyer Indemnitee becomes aware of a
third-party claim that such Buyer Indemnitee believes, in good faith, may result
in a demand by it for indemnification pursuant to this Article VI, such Buyer

                                       45
<PAGE>

Indemnitee shall notify the Seller Representative of such claim, and the Seller
Representative shall be entitled to participate in any defense of such claim.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall conduct and
control such defense in good faith but shall not settle any such claim without
the consent of the Seller Representative, which consent will be granted where
reasonable; provided, however, that, if the consent of the Seller Representative
is so obtained, neither the Seller Representative nor any other Seller shall
have any power or authority to object under any provision of this Article VI to
the amount of any demand by Buyer for indemnification with respect to such
settlement.

     SECTION 6.6. SELLER REPRESENTATIVE. The Sellers, without any further action
on the part of any Seller, consent to the appointment of J.W. Childs Associates,
L.P. as the representative of the Sellers (the "Seller Representative"), as the
attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of each such Seller, and the taking by the
Seller Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by him under this Agreement, including the
exercise of the power to (i) authorize delivery to Buyer and Sub of the Escrow
Amount, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction of an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 or any Indemnification Claims, (ii)
defend, agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and
comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any
Indemnification Claims, (iii) resolve any Indemnification Claims, and (iv) take
all actions necessary in the judgment of the Seller Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Seller Representative has
unlimited authority and power to act on behalf of each Seller with respect to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all Indemnification Claims, rights or obligations arising from and
taken pursuant to this Agreement. The Sellers will be bound by all actions taken
by the Seller Representative in connection with this Agreement, and Buyer and
Sub shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Seller
Representative. The Seller Representative will incur no liability with respect
to any action taken or suffered by him in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by him to be genuine
and to have been signed by the proper Person (and shall have no responsibility
to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction,
except his own willful misconduct or gross negligence. In all questions arising
under this Agreement, the Seller Representative may rely on the advice of
counsel, and the Seller Representative will not be liable to Sellers for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Seller Representative
based on such advice. The Seller Representative will not be required to take any
action involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is made or
provided for in a manner satisfactory to him. The Seller Representative shall be
entitled to retain counsel and to incur such expenses as the Seller
Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with its
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and all such fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the
Seller Representative shall be borne by the Sellers pro rata. In order to cover
the potential payment of such fees and expenses, the Seller Representative shall
be entitled in its discretion to withhold up to $500,000 from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to the Sellers at the Closing and to hold such
amount in an account established by the Seller Representative

                                       46
<PAGE>
with a commercial bank or other financial institution. The Seller Representative
shall be entitled to collect all amounts due to Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement and shall promptly distribute such amounts to Sellers as allocated
pursuant to this Agreement. At any time prior to the Indemnification Termination
Date, holders of a majority of the shares of Company Capital Stock as of the
date of this Agreement can appoint a new Seller Representative by written
consent by sending notice and a copy of the written consent appointing such new
Seller Representative signed by such holders. Such appointment will be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is
received by Buyer.

                  SECTION 6.7 WAIVER OF DEFENSES. To the maximum extent
permitted by law, each Indemnifying Party waives any claim or defense that the
indemnity provided for herein is unenforceable under any provision of Applicable
Law.

                  SECTION 6.8 TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. All indemnity
payments made to Buyer will be, and will be treated as, an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration.

                  SECTION 6.9. EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. If the Closing occurs, except
in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the indemnification
provisions of this Article VI shall serve as the exclusive remedy of the parties
in connection with any claim arising from or in connection with a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.10. LIMITATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. If the Closing
occurs, each of J.W. Childs Associates, Inc., J.W. Childs Equity Partners, III,
L.P. and JWC Fund III Co-Invest, LLC (the "Releasing Parties") hereby waives,
and releases each of Murray's Discount Auto Stores, Inc. and MDAS Inc. from, any
and all claims that such Releasing Party or other "Indemnitees" (as such term
is defined in Section 9.1(iii) of the Senior Subordinated Loan Agreement) may
have pursuant to (A) Section 9.1(iii)(b) and 9.1(iii)(c) of the Senior
Subordinated Loan Agreement or (B) the Subordinated Guaranty dated February 17,
2005 by MDAS, Inc. in favor of JWC Equity Funding, Inc., to be defended,
protected, indemnified or held harmless by Murray's Discount Auto Stores, Inc.
or MDAS Inc. with respect to any liability imposed on the Releasing Party as a
Seller pursuant to this Article VI.

cured within five business days following receipt by such other party of written
notice of such failure to comply;

                           (c)      by Buyer if there has been a breach of a
representation or warranty of the Company that gives rise to a failure of the
fulfillment of a condition of the Buyer's and Sub's obligations to effect the
Merger pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii) or (iii) or by Company if there has been a
breach of a representation or warranty of the Buyer or Sub that gives rise to a
failure of the fulfillment of a condition of the Company's obligations to effect

<PAGE>



                           (d)      by either Buyer or the Company if: (i) the
Merger has not been effected on or prior to the close of business on January 31,
2006; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(d)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any of its obligations contained in this Agreement has been the primary
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to have occurred on or prior
to the aforesaid date; or (ii) any court or other Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over a party hereto shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action (which order, decree, ruling or other action the parties
shall have used their reasonable efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as
applicable, subject to the provisions of Section 5.4) permanently enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final
and nonappealable.

                  The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall remain operative and in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any
Person controlling any such party or any of their respective officers or
directors, whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either Buyer or the Company, as provided in Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability
hereunder on the part of the Company, Buyer, Sub or their respective officers or
directors (except for the last sentence of Section 5.1(a) and the entirety of
Section 5.2, which shall survive the termination).

                  SECTION 8.3 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer, the Company and
the Seller Representative.

                  SECTION 8.4 WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of such party which
may legally be waived. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party. No delay on the part of any party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto of any right,
power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise
provided herein (including Section 6.9), the rights and remedies herein provided
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the parties
hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity. The failure of any party to this
Agreement



                                       51

to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

                  SECTION 9.2 INTERPRETATION.

                           (a)      When a reference is made in this Agreement
to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"

followed by the words "without limitation." This Agreement has been negotiated
by the parties and their respective counsel in good faith and will be fairly
interpreted in accordance with its terms and without any strict construction in
favor of or against any party. Prior drafts of this Agreement shall not be used
in order to interpret or construe any provisions or terms of this Agreement.

                           (b)      Each of the Company, Buyer, Sub and the
Seller Representative acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require the interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in

waived.

entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing
body of such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture
or other legal entity.

                           (d)      "Person" means any individual, corporation,
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust, association

and remedies of the seller or lender under such agreement in the event of
default are limited to repossession or sale of such property), and (iv) all
capital lease obligations (as determined in accordance with GAAP); provided,
however, that "Indebtedness" shall not include any intercompany obligation
between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries or any letters of credit,

                           (g)      "Encumbrance" means any charge, claim,

respective share of the Merger Consideration to be received by each Seller
pursuant to this Agreement.

                  SECTION 9.3 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE SIGNATURES. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. A
facsimile signature of this Agreement or any Transaction Document shall be valid
and have the same force and effect as a manually signed original.

                  SECTION 9.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES.
This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The parties
stipulate and agree that no prior drafts, memoranda, notes or discussions
relating to this Agreement shall be used at any time by either party in any
arbitration, trial or hearing, or be used or discoverable in



                                       54
<PAGE>


the discovery process pertaining thereto, to prove or evidence in any way the
intention or understanding of either party with respect to any provision or part
of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

                  SECTION 9.5 GOVERNING LAW. Except to the extent that the laws
of the State of Delaware are mandatorily applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions
thereof that would apply the laws of any other state.

                  SECTION 9.6 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

                           (a)      Any and all disputes, controversies, or
claims arising out of, or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination thereof (a
"Dispute"), shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Agreement. If a dispute cannot be resolved between the Seller
Representative and the Chief Executive Officer of Buyer, either party may submit
such Dispute to binding arbitration conducted in Chicago, Illinois, or such
other location upon which the parties may mutually agree in writing, before a
single neutral arbitrator in an arbitration by JAMS under its Streamlined
Arbitration Rules and Procedures (revised version adopted April 2003) ("JAMS
Streamlined Rules"), which rules can be viewed at www.jamsadr.com. The JAMS
Streamlined Rules will govern all aspects of the arbitration except as modified
by this Section 9.6.

                           (b)      If a party (the "Notifying Party") wishes to
submit a Dispute to JAMS, the Notifying Party shall deliver a written notice (a
"Dispute Notice") together with a copy of this Section 9.6 to the other party
(the "Responding Party") and to JAMS. In the event that either party commences a
dispute by delivering a Dispute Notice, the other party may assert any counter
claims it may have. Following receipt by the Responding Party of the Dispute
Notice, if any, the parties shall promptly meet (but in no event later than ten
business days from the date of receipt by the Responding Party of the Dispute
Notice) to agree on the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims identified by the Dispute Notice. If the parties should so agree on
a resolution of such dispute or disputes, a written memorandum (the
"Memorandum"), setting forth such agreement, shall be prepared and signed by
both parties. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement, the dispute
shall be resolved by the binding arbitration procedures set forth in this
Section 9.6.

                           (c)      The sole arbitrator, who shall be selected
in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Rules, shall be a retired or former
judge of any Federal court appointed under Article III of the United States
Constitution or any trial court of general jurisdiction or higher court.
Eligible arbitrator candidates shall not be limited to those candidates who are
listed on the JAMS "List of Neutrals". The arbitration shall be governed by the
United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. The arbitrator shall
apply New York substantive law to the proceeding.



                                       55
<PAGE>



                           (d)      In addition to the exchange of information
and discovery authorized by JAMS Streamlined Rule 13, each party may take up to
three 7-hour long depositions before the Arbitration Hearing.

                           (e)      Unless the parties agree otherwise, the
Arbitration Hearing under JAMS Streamlined Rule 17 will commence within 60 days
of the date of the JAMS Commencement Letter described in Streamlined Rule 5, and
the Arbitration Hearing will not last more than four 7-hour days (with the
hearing time equally divided between the parties). The Arbitrator will issue the
Award under Streamlined Rule 19(a) within 7 calendar days of the last day of the
Arbitration Hearing (rather than the 30 calendar days provided for under JAMS
Streamlined Rule 19(a)).

                           (f)      The arbitrator shall prepare in writing and
provide to the parties an award including factual findings and the reasons on
which the decision is based. The award and decision of the arbitrator shall be
final and binding and may be submitted to any court having jurisdiction solely
for the purpose of confirmation of the award and entry of judgment. The
arbitrator shall have the right to award or include in his award only
compensatory damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from the date due until
paid), and shall not have the right to award specific performance, injunctive
relief or exemplary or punitive damages. Any controversy concerning whether a
Dispute is an arbitrable dispute shall be determined by the arbitrator. The
parties intend that this agreement to arbitrate be valid, specifically
enforceable and irrevocable.

                           (g)      The provisions of this Section 9.6 shall
survive the expiration or early termination of this Agreement indefinitely.

                           (h)      Each party shall be responsible for its own
attorneys' fees and other costs of the arbitration.

                  SECTION 9.7 WAIVERS. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of the parties hereby further irrevocably
waives any right to specific performance, injunctive relief or exemplary or
punitive damages.

                  SECTION 9.8 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors or assigns.

                  SECTION 9.9 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to



                                       56
<PAGE>


any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

        SECTION 9.10 PERFORMANCE BY SUB. Buyer hereby agrees to cause Sub to
comply with its obligations hereunder and to cause Sub to consummate the Merger
as contemplated herein and whenever this Agreement requires Sub to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking of Buyer to
cause Sub to take such action.

        SECTION 9.11 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or
to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
