 Section 2.01. _The Merger._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged
(the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

  (b) The closing of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver (by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of all conditions to the Merger (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the closing of the Merger, but subject to satisfaction of such condition), or at such other place, date and time as may be agreed by the parties. The date on which the closing of the Merger occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date". The parties shall prepare and on the Closing Date shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law and shall make all other filings or recordings required under Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and is specified in the certificate of merger).  ##### Table of Contents

  

  (c) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the Delaware Law. 

  

   

    

 Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, 

  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or 
Section 2.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive  $37.00 in cash, without
interest (the "Merger  Consideration");  
      
      |   (b) each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or 
owned by Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries  immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and  no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and  
      
      |   (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be  converted into
and become one share of common stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall  constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the  Surviving Corporation.  
    

   

    

 Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the purpose of exchanging
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.02(a) (the "Certificates") for the Merger
Consideration, and Parent and Exchange Agent shall enter into an exchange
agreement which shall, in form and substance, be reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Parent shall, on and from time to time after the Effective Date,
make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Certificates. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send,
to each holder of Certificates a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) for use in
such exchange. 

  

  (b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02(a) shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share formerly represented by a Certificate. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.  ##### Table of Contents

  

  (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. 

  

  (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest and other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Certificate for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

  (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand. 

  

   

    

 Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section 2.02,
Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted such Shares in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal. If,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
the right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to

 receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

  

   

    

 Section 2.05. _Company Stock Options._ (a) Except as provided
in Section 2.05(b), each option (a "Company Stock Option") to purchase
Shares granted under an equity compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company (a "Company Stock Plan"), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled as of
the Effective Time, and in consideration therefor the Company shall pay the
holder of such Company Stock Option at the Effective Time an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of $37.00 over the
applicable exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option multiplied
by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased (assuming full
vesting of such Company Stock Option) had such holder exercised such
Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

  (b) (i) Each Specified Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled as of the Effective Time, and in substitution therefor Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time ( _i.e._ , during the next available time that is not a "closed period" under applicable law or Parents company policy), provide to the holder of such Specified Stock Option a stock option of equivalent value under an equity compensation plan of Parent then in effect (a "Substituted Stock Option"). A Substituted Stock Option shall be deemed to have value equivalent to the applicable Specified Stock Option if (x) the exercise price of such Substituted Stock Option is calculated pursuant to the rules of Parents scheme for substituted grants on the date of grant of such Substituted Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Parents ordinary shares ("Parent Shares") covered by such Substituted Stock Option is equal to, as rounded down to the nearest whole share, the product of the number of Shares that the holder of such Specified Stock Option could have purchased (assuming full vesting of such Specified Stock Option) had such holder exercised such Specified Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), and further _multiplied by_ a Substitution Premium (as defined below). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be a number (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) determined by dividing the pound sterling equivalent of $37.00 (using an exchange rate agreed between Parent and the Company, as in effect on the date on which the Effective Time occurs) _by_ the average of the closing sales prices of a Parent Share (expressed in pound sterling at the same exchange rate) on the London Stock Exchange during the five full trading days immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time occurs. The "Substitution Premium" shall be a number greater than 1 that Parents Remuneration 
  ##### Table of Contents

  

 Committee shall determine in its sole and reasonable discretion prior to
the Effective Time to take into account the fact that Specified Stock Options
would otherwise have vested over time, whereas Substituted Stock Options will
vest on the basis of performance. 

  

  (ii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall have effective a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of Parent Shares equal to the number of Parent Shares subject to the Substituted Stock Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained) as long as any Substituted Stock Options may remain outstanding. 

  

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options any required notices and shall take any other required or appropriate action under the terms of such Company Stock Plans, including (i) obtaining any consents from such holders and (ii) making any amendments to the terms of such Company Stock Plans, in each case that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. 

  

   

    

 Section 2.06. _Adjustments._  If, during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
Shares shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

   

    

 Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article
2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, options
or warrants, as the case may be, in respect of which the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding. 

  

   

    

 Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this Article 2.  ##### Table of Contents

 Section 4.01. _Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of
which is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure
to be so qualified is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the

 Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of the Transaction Agreements to which it is
a party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
thereby are within the Companys corporate powers and, except for obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval in connection with the consummation of
the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company. Assuming the representation in Section 5.08 is true
and correct, the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Shares (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote
of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements. Each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except (i) as the same may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium or similar laws of general application relating to or
affecting creditors rights and (ii) for the limitations imposed by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity). 

  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys 
Board of Directors has (i) determined that the Transaction  Agreements and
the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to  and in the best interest
of the Companys stockholders,  (ii) approved the Transaction Agreements and
the  transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) resolved to  recommend
adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders,  (iv) declared this Agreement
and the Merger advisable and  (v) directed that this Agreement be submitted
to a vote at  a meeting of the Companys stockholders.

 Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a
party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
thereby require no action by the Company by or in respect of, or filing by
the Company with, any governmental body, agency, official or authority,
domestic, foreign or supranational, other than (i) the filing of a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
HSR Act and any applicable competition, antitrust or similar law of any
jurisdiction outside the United States, (iii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, (iv) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under applicable state securities laws and the securities laws of
any foreign country and (v) any actions or filings the failure of which to
take is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, there is no material issue with regard to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements under the 
  ##### Table of Contents

  

 HSR Act or any applicable competition, antitrust or similar law of any
jurisdiction outside the United States.

party and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated thereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in
a violation or breach of any provision of any law, statute, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree applicable to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) require any consent or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or
permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or the loss of any
material benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled
under any provision of any agreement, other instrument, license, franchise,
permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective assets are bound or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) for such contraventions,
conflicts, violations or breaches, failures to obtain any such consent or
take any other action, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations,
losses or Liens that are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 Section 5.01. _Corporate Existence and Power._ Each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary is duly incorporated, duly organized, validly existing and,
in the case of Merger Subsidiary only, in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of

Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has heretofore made available to the
Company true and complete copies of the organizational documents of Parent

 Section 5.02. _Corporate Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of each Transaction Agreement
to which it is a party and the consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary
of the transactions contemplated thereby are within the corporate powers of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and, except for the required approval of
Parents shareholders and the adoption of this Agreement by the sole
stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, which in the case of Merger Subsidiary will
be obtained promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby,
have been duly authorized by all necessary company action on the part of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary. The only vote of the holders of any of
Parents share capital necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements is the affirmative
vote on a show of hands of a simple majority of the holders of ordinary
shares of Parent present in person at a duly convened general meeting of
Parent, or the affirmative vote on a poll of a simple majority of the votes
attached to the issued ordinary shares of Parent voted in person or by proxy
at such a general meeting in favor of the Merger. For the avoidance of
doubt, no vote of the holders of any of Parents share capital is necessary
in connection with the entry into and performance by Parent of the Dynepo
License Agreement. Each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary

the Effective  Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent  shall continue and maintain the Companys 2005 Management  Bonus
Plan on behalf of Continuing Employees in accordance with  its terms and
conditions in effect as of the date hereof and  shall pay any amounts due
thereunder in respect of the 2005  performance year in accordance with such
terms, and for the 2006  performance year and subsequent performance years,
Continuing  Employees shall participate in the bonus plans of Parent as in 
effect from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in  this
Agreement shall constitute an express or implied promise of  continued
employment for any period or at all and will not  interfere in any way with
an employers right to dismiss a  Continuing Employee from employment at any
time, with or without  cause.  
      
      |   (b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the 
Company or its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior  to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent  and its Subsidiaries
for all purposes under each Employee Plan,  International Plan or similar
plan, program or arrangement in  which such Continuing Employee is eligible
to participate after  the Effective Time ("Continuing Employee  Plans"),
except as otherwise limited or prohibited by  applicable law, statute,
ordinance, rule or regulation or the  terms of such plan ( _provided_ that no
such term shall  apply to Continuing Employees differently than other
similarly  situated employees of Parent).  
      
      |   (c) Following the Effective Time, for purposes of each 
Continuing Employee Plan that provides employee welfare  benefits, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,  (i) waive any pre-existing
condition, exclusion,  actively-at-work requirement, waiting period or
similar  limitation and (ii) provide full ##### Table of Contents

        |

      |   credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments
made  or incurred by each Continuing Employee prior to the Effective 
Time.  
      
      |   (d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, 
honor each Company Employee Plan and Company International Plan  in
accordance with its terms and all obligations thereunder that  have accrued
as of the Effective Time, including obligations  with respect to vacation,
severance agreements as set forth in  Section 7.05(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, sick  leave and paid time off. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in  this Agreement is intended to prevent Parent from
amending,  suspending or terminating any such Company Employee Plan or 
Company International Plan in accordance with its terms, or  causing a
Subsidiary of Parent to effect such an amendment,  suspension or
termination.  
      
      |   (e) Without limiting the generality of  Section 7.05(a),
Parent and the Company, as applicable,  shall provide to the employees of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries the retention, severance and other benefits
set  forth in Schedule 7.05(e) to this Agreement. Prior to the  Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good  faith (i) to prepare
the plans, programs and other  documents necessary or appropriate to provide
such benefits;  _provided_ that the Company shall not make any general 
communication regarding such plans, programs, documents or  benefits to the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries  without obtaining the prior
approval of Parent (such approval  not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and (ii) to  prepare any reports or other filings with the SEC
required to  disclose any such benefits within any applicable SEC
deadlines.

Affiliates shall  acquire, or agree to acquire, whether in the open market
or  otherwise, any rights in any equity securities of the Company  other
than pursuant to the Merger. During the period from the  date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and  the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms  hereof, except as consented to in
writing by the Company, none  of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall make
any material  acquisition that is reasonably likely to (a) materially 
impair Parents ability to consummate the transactions  contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements or (b) cause a  material delay of the Merger.
