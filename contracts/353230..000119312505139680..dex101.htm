the application for or granting of any Permits which would invalidate or, to
the Knowledge of each of the Sellers and Holder, result in the denial of
renewal or loss of material benefits of such Permits. No outstanding
violations are or have been recorded in respect of any of the Permits. No

operate such aspects of the Business as may not be operated by Buyer (or, if

(a) If Sellers or Holder terminate this Agreement as provided in Section

(c) The Parties hereby agree that damages and costs to be incurred by the
terminating Party pursuant to Sections 14.1(ii) or 14.1(iii), as applicable,
in connection with such termination will be difficult to determine and/or

(e) The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage could occur, there may exist no adequate remedy
at Law and damages could be difficult to determine. Therefore, as an
alternative to the Termination Fee any Party shall, in its sole discretion,
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any
other remedy at Law or equity; _provided_ that any Party seeking specific
performance hereunder shall waive any and all rights such Party may have to a

participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and in any compromise,
settlement or strategic decision relating thereto; _provided_ that if the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that representation by the
Indemnifying Partys counsel of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interests, then the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Partys counsel) to defend or prosecute such Third Party Claim at
its own expense through counsel of its own choosing if the Indemnifying Party
gives notice thereof to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice or such shorter time period as
required so that the interests of the Indemnified Party would not be
materially prejudiced as a result of the failure to have received such notice
(the " _Election Period_ "). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized during the Election Period to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that shall be necessary or appropriate to
protect its rights or the rights of the Indemnifying Party. If (i) the
Election Period expires or (ii) the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party during the Election Period that the Indemnifying Party does
not elect to defend or prosecute the Third Party Claim for which the
Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification hereunder, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled prosecute or defend the Third Party Claim
and recover from the Indemnifying Party all of the reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) associated therewith.
Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Third Party Claim by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this paragraph, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to approve the terms of settlement of any Third Party Claim,
which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. So long as the
Indemnifying Party is contesting any such claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim without the
Indemnifying Partys consent, which consent shall not to be unreasonably
delayed or withheld. If the Indemnifying Party is not contesting such claim in
good faith, then the Indemnified Party may conduct and control, through
counsel of their own choosing and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall  



 

49  cooperate with them in connection therewith. The failure of the Indemnified
Party to participate in, conduct or control such defense shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any obligation they may have hereunder.



(c) _Cooperation_. The Parties agree reasonably to cooperate with one another
and their respective counsel in contesting and defending any Third Party Claim
in any manner the other Party may reasonably request (including furnishing
evidence and testimony and granting reasonable access to the pertinent books,
records and personnel (to the extent such personnel are available) in their
possession or control) so as to not unreasonably expose the other to undue
risk of loss or, if appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in
question, in making (i) any counterclaim against the Third Party, or (ii) any
cross complaint against any Person.



(d) _No Settlement_. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15.3 to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (i) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the Third Party
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written release from all
liability in respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party, or (iii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim in a
manner that will require the Indemnified Party to pay any money, except as
contemplated by Section 15.3(b).



15.4. _Direct Claims_. In the event that the Indemnified Party asserts an
Indemnity Claim, including an Indemnity Claim hereunder, that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall transmit to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice (the " _Direct Claim Notice_ "). A Direct
Claim Notice shall specify, to the extent known by the Indemnified Party, the
nature of and specific basis for any such Indemnity Claim or the nature of and
specific basis of any suit, action, investigation or proceeding set forth
therein, the amount or the good faith estimated amount thereof to the extent
then practicable and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement. The failure to provide such notice will
not affect any rights hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Parties
are materially prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days from its receipt of the Direct
Claim Notice that it disputes such Indemnity Claim, the Indemnity Claims
specified in the Direct Claim Notice will be deemed payable by the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed
such Indemnity Claim, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a thirty
(30) day period after receipt of the Direct Claim Notice to resolve such
Indemnity Claim. If no resolution is reached within such thirty (30) day
period, the dispute regarding the Indemnity Claim shall be resolved by
litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction.



15.5. _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Time Limitation on
Indemnification_. All of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall  



 

50  survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date and, if a claims notice has been provided by such date, shall remain in
full force and effect until final resolution thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and without limiting any other rights and remedies available to the
Parties, the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 (Title
to Assets and Properties), Section 4.9 (Environmental Matters) and Section
4.13 (Taxes) shall survive and remain in full force and effect until sixty
(60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extension thereof) and, if a claims notice has been provided by
such date, shall remain in full force and effect until final resolution
thereof. The covenants and agreements of the Sellers, Holder and Buyer
contained in this Agreement shall survive and remain in full force and effect
for the applicable period specified therein, or if no such period is
specified, indefinitely. The provisions of this Article XV shall survive for
so long as any other Section of this Agreement shall survive. The
indemnification obligations of Sellers and Holder under Sections 15.1(c), (e)
and (f) and the indemnification obligations of Buyer under Sections 15.2(c),
and (e) shall terminate on the date eighteen (18) months following the
Closing Date, except with respect to Indemnity Claims made prior to such date.



15.6. _Limitation on Indemnity_.



(a) _Indemnity Basket of Buyer, Sellers and Holder_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer, Sellers and Holder
acknowledge and agree that, except for any Indemnity Environmental Claim,
Indemnity No Solicitation Claim, Indemnity Non-Competition Claim or Indemnity
Tax Claim, an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to an Indemnified Party
in respect of any Indemnity Claim made pursuant to Section 15.1(a), (b) or
(c), or Section 15.2(a), (b) or (c) hereunder until the amount of Losses
comprising the Indemnity Claim(s), individually or in the aggregate, exceeds
$200,000.00 (the " _Indemnity Basket_ "), whereupon, if such Indemnity Claims
exceed the amount of the Indemnity Basket, an Indemnifying Party shall be
liable and the Indemnified Party may recover, all such Losses to the extent
they exceed the Indemnity Basket, subject to the Indemnity Cap (as defined in
Section 15.6(b)). The Indemnity Basket shall not apply to Indemnity Claims by
Buyer Indemnified Parties arising from fraud, willful or criminal misconduct
of the Sellers Indemnified Parties (collectively, the " _Sellers Indemnity
Basket Exclusions_ "). The Sellers and the Holder shall be responsible for the
full amount of all Claims arising from the Sellers Indemnity Basket
Exclusions, and the amount of such Claims shall be included in the
determination as to whether the Indemnity Basket is met for all other
Indemnity Claims by Buyer Indemnified Parties. The Indemnity Basket shall not
apply to Indemnity Claims by Sellers Indemnified Parties arising from
fraud, willful or criminal misconduct by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnity Basket Exclusions_ "). Buyer shall be
responsible for the full amount of all Claims arising from the matters
addressed in the Buyer Indemnity Basket Exclusions, and the amount of such
Losses shall be included in the determination as to whether the Indemnity
Basket is met for all other Losses by Sellers Indemnified Parties.



 

51 (b) _Indemnity Cap of Buyer, Sellers and Holder_. Buyer, the Sellers and
Holder acknowledge and agree that, except for any Indemnity Environmental
Claim, Indemnity No Solicitation Claim, Indemnity Non-Competition Claim or
Indemnity Tax Claim, in no event shall an Indemnifying Party ever be required
to indemnify an Indemnified Party for Indemnity Claims made pursuant to
Section 15.1(a), (b) or (c), or Section 15.2(a), (b) or (c) of this Agreement
to the extent that the amount of such Indemnity Claim results in the aggregate
Indemnity Claims by: (i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties against the Sellers
and Holder exceeding $25,000,000; and (ii) the Sellers Indemnified Parties
against Buyer exceeding $25,000,000 (each, an " _Indemnity Cap_ "). The
respective Indemnity Caps shall not apply to Losses arising from or relating
to the Sellers Indemnity Basket Exclusions and the Buyer Indemnity Basket
Exclusions, and Losses arising from or relating to the Sellers Indemnity
Basket Exclusions and the Buyer Indemnity Basket Exclusions shall not be used
to determine whether the applicable Indemnity Cap has been met. Whenever an
Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified
Party from and against, or to reimburse an Indemnified Party for a Loss, such
Indemnifying Party will, subject to the provisions of this Article XV, pay
the Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss reduced by the net proceeds of
any insurance policy received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Loss.



15.7. _Payment_. Subject to Section 15.10, upon the determination of the
liability for a claimed Loss under this Article XV, the appropriate Party
shall pay to the other, as the case may be, within five (5) days after such
determination, the amount of such claimed Loss.



15.8. _Other Limitations_. Anything to the contrary in this Article XV
notwithstanding, no Party may assert or recover consequential damages, special
damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, punitive damages, lost profits
or similar items, whether asserted as an Indemnity Claim or otherwise. 



15.9. _Effect of Taxes_. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this Article XV shall be (a) increased to take account of any
net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the
receipt or accrual of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such
increase) and (b) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence of the Loss that
gave rise to such Indemnity Claim.



15.10. _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties acknowledge that their sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing for any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement shall be the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article XV. In addition, each Party acknowledges
that all of its obligations in this Agreement to indemnify any other Party
are subject to and shall be in accordance with this Article XV.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer
shall have no right to indemnification under Section 15.1 with respect to any
Loss or alleged Loss if Buyer shall have received a commensurate reduction in
the Purchase Price based on either the Preliminary Closing Date Statement or
the Final Closing Date Statement; _provided_ that  



 

52  such commensurate reduction relates to the facts and matters that are the
subject of such Loss or alleged Loss.



15.11. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes, the Parties
agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat)
any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws.



15.12. _Relation of Indemnity to Escrow Payment_. The amount of the Escrow
Payment shall be reduced by any unpaid amount that is owed under this Article
XV by the Sellers or Holder to any Buyer Indemnified Party at the time the
Escrow Payment is due. Any such reduction in the Escrow Payment shall
have the same effect as a direct payment by Sellers or Holder of such amount
owing under this Article XV to Buyer. The rights of any Buyer Indemnified
Party under the preceding sentence are in addition to any other rights and
remedies that such Buyer Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement.



15.13. _Relation to Escrow_. Each of the Sellers and Holder further
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to Buyer under this Agreement,
including its indemnification obligations under this Article XV, are not, in
any way, limited to funds set aside pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement. To the extent that the amount set aside pursuant to the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement is not sufficient to satisfy the Sellers and
Holders obligations under this Article XV, the Sellers and Holder shall
remain fully liable for such obligations.



ARTICLE XVI. __

_EMPLOYEE MATTERS_



16.1. _Employment_.



(a) Effective immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall (or, if applicable,
shall cause Buyer Designee to) offer employment to each Person employed by the
Business on the Closing Date, including those Persons on approved leaves of
absence, who will be offered employment upon their return from leave (an "
_Active Employee_ "). Such offers of employment shall be for the base
compensation and have benefit levels comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits enjoyed by Active Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Except
as provided in this Article XVI with respect to specific types of benefits,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, give full credit for each
Active Employees period of service with any of the Sellers or their
Affiliates prior to the Closing for all purposes (except benefit accrual in a
defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements sponsored by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing in which
any of the Active Employees are eligible to participate. 



(b) Effective as of Closing Date, the Sellers shall terminate the employment
of each Active Employee and each Active Employee who is an active participant
in any Business Benefit Plans shall cease to be an active participant. All of
the Active  



 

53  Employees shall become immediately eligible to participate in each of
Buyers employee benefit plans in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Agreement and the eligibility and other terms and conditions of each
such plan. The Sellers agree that they are responsible for terminating the
active participation of such employees in the Business Benefit Plans pursuant
to applicable Laws and shall seek any necessary approvals with respect to the
termination of any such active participation.



(c) Buyers welfare and fringe benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements (" _Buyer s Welfare Plans_") made available to Active Employees
shall treat service by Active Employees with the Sellers in the same manner as
service with Buyer for purposes of eligibility to participate in such plans,
programs, policies or arrangements, and Buyer shall cause any limitations
thereunder on participation or coverage of pre-existing conditions to be
waived with respect to Active Employees and their eligible dependents and
beneficiaries. Buyers Welfare Plans shall give full credit for deductible
and co-payment amounts incurred under Business Benefit Plans for the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs when determining deductibles and co-payments
under Buyers Welfare Plans with respect to Active Employees.



(d) _WARN Act Compliance_. For a period of sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not effect any termination or layoff that results in an
employment loss at any single site of employment during any 30-day period of
more than 33% or fifty (50) of the Active Employees working full-time
and Buyer shall not effect a plant closing that results in an employment loss
during any 30-day period of fifty (50) or more of the Active Employees working
full-time. For purposes of this Section 16.1(d), the number of employees shall
be based on the number of Active Employees at the Closing Date. For sixty
(60) days after Closing, Buyer shall not take any action which would trigger
an obligation to provide advance notice of termination pursuant to the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any other applicable advance
notice or notification Law.



16.2. _Savings Plan_. The Sellers agrees to permit each Active Employee to
effect a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of his or her account balances under the Sellers savings plan if such
rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Active Employee.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and provided that the
Sellers are reasonably satisfied consistent with the regulations under
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code that Buyers savings plan meets the
requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, the Sellers
may provide that one or more Active Employees may elect to effect, and,
provided that Buyer is reasonably satisfied consistent with the regulations
under Section 401(a)(31) of the Code that the Sellers savings plan meets the
requirements for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, Buyer agrees
to cause Buyers savings plan to accept, a "direct rollover" to Buyers
saving plan of such Active Employees account balances under the Sellers
savings plan if such rollover is elected in accordance with applicable Law by
such Active Employee, provided that the Active Employees will be required to
settle any and all  



 

54  outstanding loan balances in the Sellers savings plan in accordance with
its terms prior to such transfer.



16.3. _Maintenance of Books and Records_. Each of Buyer, the Sellers and
Holder shall preserve until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date
all records, including electronic data records, possessed or to be possessed
by such Party relating to any of the assets, liabilities or business of the
Business prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, where there is a
legitimate purpose (which shall be deemed to include tax filings of either
Party), such Party shall provide the other Party with access, upon prior
reasonably written request specifying the need therefor, during regular
business hours, to (a) the management employees of the Business or Buyer, as
applicable, (b) the books of account and records of such Party related to the
Business, and (c) the payroll and personnel records of the Business, but, in
each case, only to the extent relating to the assets, liabilities or business
of the Business prior to the Closing Date, and the other Parties and their
representatives shall have the right to make copies of such books and records;
_provided, however,_ that the foregoing right of access shall not be
exercisable in such a manner as to interfere unreasonably with the normal
operations and business of such Party; and _provided_ _further,_ that, as to
so much of such information as constitutes trade secrets or confidential
business information of such Party, the requesting Party and its officers,
directors and representatives will use due care to not disclose such
information except (i) as required by Law, (ii) with the prior written Consent
of such Party, which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (iii)
where such information becomes available to the public generally, or becomes
generally known to competitors of such Party, through sources other than the
requesting Party, its Affiliates or its officers, directors
or representatives. After the above referenced seven year anniversary, such
records may nevertheless be destroyed by a Party if such Party sends to the
other Parties written notice of its intent to destroy records, specifying with
particularity the contents of the records to be destroyed. Such records may
then be destroyed after the 30th day after such notice is given unless another
Party objects to the destruction in which case the Party seeking to destroy
the records shall deliver such records to the objecting Party.
