assign a value to any item that is greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or that is less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. The Accountant's Report shall set forth a

the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced.

been incurred and paid by Seller or its Affiliates, including the Target
Company, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
but which are payable or to be borne by Buyer under the terms of this

herein, Current Assets shall exclude (A) cash (other than petty cash located
at the premises of the Station which is delivered to Buyer at the Closing) and

Buyer or the Target Company following the Closing, (D) all rights to Tax
refunds and any Tax prepayments, which will not benefit Buyer following the

following the Closing Date, (F) receivables from Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller or any of their respective directors, officers, members or stockholders
and (G) any claim or proceeds in respect of an Interim Closing Casualty Loss

in a manner consistent with the Financial Statements and the example on
Exhibit B, including accounts payable, accrued payroll, bonus, vacation and
personal leave obligations, accrued sales commissions, deferred revenue

Liabilities, which would not burden Buyer following the Closing Date, (4)

(f) In applying the terms of this Section 2.3, if there is a conflict between
GAAP and consistency with the manner in which the Financial Statements have
been prepared, consistency with the Financial Statement preparation shall
control.

  

  

2.4 Purchase Price Allocation; Tax Reporting Covenant. The parties hereby
agree that the Purchase Price, after giving effect to the adjustments provided
in Section 2.3 above, plus any liabilities deemed assumed by Buyer from Seller
and any other relevant Purchase Price items (including the adjustment
described in Section 5.2(c)) shall be allocated among the assets of the Target
Company for all purposes (including financial accounting and federal and state
income tax reporting purposes) in accordance with Schedule 2.4 (the "Purchase
Price Allocation"). Seller shall prepare the Purchase Price Allocation and
provide a copy of such allocation to Buyer for review and comment before the
Closing (or by such date as may otherwise be agreed to by Seller and Buyer).
The parties will work cooperatively and in good faith to mutually agree on the
Purchase Price Allocation and to resolve all differences related to the
Purchase Price Allocation. After the parties mutually agree on the Purchase
Price Allocation, (i) each of the parties agrees to determine its respective
federal taxable income consequences, and, as applicable, state taxable income
consequences for any state income or franchise tax purposes, strictly and
fully in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation, and to prepare and
file all applicable Tax Returns, information returns, forms and other Tax
reports and documents (and attachments thereto) in a manner wholly consistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation; and (ii) no party shall take any position
inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation on any Tax Return or in any
audit or judicial or administrative proceedings before any Governmental Entity
or court of law (except to the extent otherwise required by a final
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code).

the Communications Act for the current operation of the Station. The FCC
Licenses are in full force and effect and have not been revoked, suspended,
canceled, rescinded or terminated and have not expired. Section 3.15(b)(ii) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all pending and/or non-consummated
material FCC applications or material requests for waiver with respect to the
FCC Licenses (the "Pending FCC Applications"). The FCC Licenses are not
subject to any conditions, except for those conditions that appear on the
faces of the FCC Licenses or that are set forth in the FCC's rules,
regulations and policies or that are applicable generally to facilities of the
same types, natures, classes or locations.

  

  

(c) [Intentionally omitted.] 
 

  

  

(d) (i) To the Knowledge of Seller, except as set forth in Section 3.15(d)(i)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there is not pending or threatened any
action by or before the FCC to revoke, suspend, cancel, rescind or adversely
modify any of the material FCC Licenses (other than proceedings to amend FCC
rules of general applicability) and there are no facts that would reasonably
be expected to result in any of the above (except with respect to the FCC
Licenses set forth in Section 3.15(d)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule),
and (ii) as of the Disclosure Schedule Delivery Date, there is not now issued
or outstanding or pending by or before the FCC any order to show cause, notice
of violation, notice of apparent liability, or notice of forfeiture against
the Target Company, the Station or the FCC Licenses. The Station is operating
in material compliance with the FCC Licenses, the Communications Act and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration. To
the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred or condition or state of facts
exists that constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a violation or non-compliance with the Communications Act or the
terms of any such FCC License, except where any failure to comply with any of
the foregoing has not had, and will not have, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

defined pursuant to the Communications Act).

  

  

(f) All material reports and filings required to be filed with the FCC and any
other Governmental Entity by the Target Company with respect to the Station
have been timely filed, except where the failure to make any timely filing has
not had and would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and the Target Company
has paid all regulatory fees due with respect to the Station.

  

  

(g) Seller is legally, financially and otherwise qualified under the
Communications Act to perform its obligations hereunder. Seller has no
Knowledge of any fact or condition that would, under the Communications Act or
otherwise, disqualify Seller as the transferor of the Station, constitute
grounds for the filing of a petition to deny or objection related to the
qualifications of Seller or cause the FCC to fail to approve the FCC
Application in a timely fashion based on the qualifications of Seller.

  

  

(h) Section 3.15(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a list of (i)

the Station; and (ii) any MVPD with more than 10,000 subscribers in the
Station's Designated Market Area that as of the date identified therein, to
Seller's Knowledge, does not carry the signal of the Station. The terms of the
Target Company's Retransmission Agreements do not conflict with, in any
material respect, the geographic limitations under the CBS Affiliation
Agreement. To Seller's Knowledge, the Station made valid retransmission
consent elections on all applicable MVPDs for the 2012-2014 election cycle.

meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a single employer pension

the Knowledge of Seller, all Company Benefit Plan "fiduciaries" (within the
meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have acted in accordance with the
provisions of all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code with respect
to the Company Benefit Plans, except to the extent any noncompliance therewith
has not had and would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller and the
Target Company have performed all material obligations required to be
performed by them under, are not in any material respect in default under or
in material violation of, and have no Knowledge of any material default or
material violation by any party to, any Company Benefit Plan, except where
such a breach, default or violation has not had and would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the Disclosure Schedule Delivery Date, no Action is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course).

  

  

(f) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified, and each trust
established in connection with any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter from the IRS which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the
exempt status of any such trust.

  

  

(g) To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan. Neither Seller nor the Target Company has
incurred any material liability for any penalty or tax arising under Section
4971, 4972, 4980, 4980B or 6652 of the Code or any material liability under
Section 502 of ERISA. Within the last five (5) years, neither the Seller nor
the Target Company has incurred any material liability under, arising out of
or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course),
including any material liability in connection with the termination or
reorganization of any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, no fact or event exists that could rise to any
such liability.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31

to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due dates. Under
each Company Benefit Plan which is a single-employer pension plan, as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Plan's most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Plan,
and there has been no material change in the financial condition of such Plan
since the last day of the most recent plan year.

  

  

(i) Except pursuant to the Severance Plan, the Stay Bonus Plan and as
otherwise contemplated under Section 5.2, and except as set forth in Section
3.16(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not, either alone or in combination
with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of
the Target Company to severance pay or any other payment from the Target
Company or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting for, or increase the
amount of, compensation due from the Target Company to any such employee or
officer.

  

  

(j) None of the Company Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date would result separately or in the aggregate (including as a
result of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) in the
payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code.

delivered by each of Buyer and the Buyer's Parents and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Seller and Seller's Parent,
constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement, when executed and delivered by each
of Buyer and the Buyer's Parents (assuming due authorization and delivery by
the other parties thereto) shall constitute, a valid and binding obligation of
each of Buyer and the Buyer's Parents, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, except in each case as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except as such enforceability is subject to general principles of equity
(whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

4.3 Qualification as a Broadcast Licensee. Buyer is, and at Closing shall be,
legally, financially and otherwise qualified under the Communications Act to
acquire the Target Company and the FCC Licenses from Seller and to be the
licensee of the FCC Licenses. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates nor any other
Person with an "attributable interest" (as defined in the Communications Act)
in Buyer, has an attributable interest in any television station or other
business regulated by the FCC that is located within the Station's Designated
Market Area. To Buyer's Knowledge, there is no fact or circumstance that
would, under the Communications Act or otherwise, (i) disqualify Buyer or its
Affiliates or any other Person with an attributable interest in Buyer as the
owner and operator of the Station or constitute grounds for the filing of a
petition to deny or objection related to the qualifications of the Buyer, or
(ii) cause the FCC to fail to provide the FCC Consent in a timely fashion
based on the qualifications of Buyer or to condition the FCC Consent on the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any of Buyer's or its Affiliates' assets
or operations, whether by consent, decree, hold separate order or otherwise.
No waiver of any FCC rule, regulation or policy existing as of the date of
this Agreement will be required, with respect to Buyer, to obtain the FCC
Consent. Buyer is not an entity in which any owner, parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of ABC Television Network, Fox Television Network or NBC Television
Network (or the WB Television Network or its successor) has a twenty percent
(20%) or greater equity interest.

  

  

4.4 Governmental Approvals. No Governmental Approvals are required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements by Buyer or the Buyer's Parents, except (a) the
Governmental Approvals identified in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 3.4, (b)
Governmental Approvals that become applicable as a result of matters
specifically related to Seller or its Affiliates, and (c) such other
Governmental Approvals the failure of which to be obtained or made would not
materially impair Buyer's or either Buyer's Parent's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise perform its obligations
hereunder.

  

  

4.5 No Conflict or Violation. The execution, delivery and performance by each
of Buyer and the Buyer's Parents of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not (i) assuming all Governmental Approvals described in Section
4.4 have been obtained, violate any applicable Law to which Buyer or either
Buyer's Parent is subject, (ii) require a consent or approval under, conflict
with, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default under,
result in the acceleration of, create in any party the right to accelerate,
terminate or cancel any Contract to which Buyer or either Buyer's Parent is a
party, or (iii) violate the Organizational Documents of any of Buyer or the
Buyer's Parents, except with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair Buyer's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

4.6 Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, threatened which challenge the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, which seek to enjoin or prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or which would otherwise
materially impair or delay Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer is not subject to any order of any Governmental
Entity which would materially impair or delay Buyer's ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.7 Acquisition of Equity for Investment. Buyer has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of Buyer's purchase of the Purchased Interests. Buyer
confirms that it can bear the economic risk of its investment in the Purchased
Interests and can afford to lose its entire investment in the Purchased
Interests, has been furnished the materials relating to Buyer's purchase of
the Purchased Interests which it has requested, and Seller has provided Buyer
the opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management employees of
the Target Company and to acquire additional information about the business
and financial condition of the Target Company. Buyer is acquiring the
Purchased Interests for investment and not with a view toward or for sale in
connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
distributing or selling such Purchased Interests. Buyer agrees that the
Purchased Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration available thereunder.

  

  

4.8 Funding.

  

  

(a) Buyer currently has, and on the Closing Date will have, all funds
necessary to pay the Purchase Price and all other amounts payable by Buyer
hereunder.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing (and with Buyer's express acknowledgement
that Buyer's obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned upon Buyer
or either Buyer's Parent receiving financing):

  

  

(i) The complete and correct copy of the existing credit facility in place
between U.S. Bank National Association, SunTrust Bank, Bank of America, N.A.,
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the Northern Trust Company, Associated
Bank, N.A. and Comerica Bank (collectively, the "Lenders") and JCI (the
"Existing Credit Facility") is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to the current report
filed by JCI on Form 8-K with the Securities Exchange Commission on August 18,
2010.

  

  

(ii) Exhibit D attached hereto sets forth complete and correct copies of the
executed written commitments and related term sheets from the Lenders to
increase the Existing Credit Facility (collectively, the "Financing
Commitments," and together with the Existing Credit Facility, the "Financing
Documents"), pursuant to which certain of the Lenders have committed to
provide JCI with financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Financing").

  

 

  

(iii) Each of the Financing Documents (A) is in full force and effect and has
not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect, and (B) in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of JCI and the other parties thereto. There are no
other agreements, fee letters, side letters or arrangements relating to the
Financing Documents (in each case other than any fee letter containing no
conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing), nor are there any
agreements, fee letters, side letters or arrangements that could limit, affect
or impair the availability of the Financing. No event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of JCI under any term or condition of the Financing Documents. JCI
has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the
Financing Commitments. JCI has fully paid any and all commitment fees and
other fees, expenses and other amounts payable prior to or on the date hereof
under the Financing Commitments and any other documentation in respect of the
Financing. The conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties to the
Financing Commitments to make the Financing available to JCI on the terms
therein consist solely of the conditions expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.9 Solvency. Each of Buyer and the Buyer's Parents is currently Solvent and
on and after the Closing Date, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, each of Buyer, the Buyer's Parents and the
Target Company shall be Solvent.

  

  

4.10 Brokers' Fees. Except for Methuselah Advisors (whose fees shall be
Buyer's responsibility as provided under Section 7.2(c)), no broker,
investment banker or finder is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Buyer or either Buyer's Parent.

  

  

4.11 No Reliance. Buyer, the Buyer's Parents and their Representatives have
received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, Contracts
and other assets of the Target Company as Buyer, the Buyer's Parents, and
their Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested to review, and
Buyer, the Buyer's Parents, and their Representatives have had full
opportunity to meet with the management of the Target Company and to discuss
the business and assets of the Target Company. Each of Buyer and the Buyer's
Parents acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (a) neither Seller, Seller's
Parent nor the Target Company nor any of their respective Affiliates nor
Representatives makes, or has made, any representations or warranties relating
to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and none of Buyer or the Buyer's Parents is
relying on any representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth
in this Agreement, (b) no Person has been authorized by Seller, Seller's
Parent or the Target Company or any of their Affiliates to make any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and if made,
such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Buyer or the
Buyer's Parents as having been authorized by such party and (c) any estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Buyer, either Buyer's Parent, or any of their Representatives are not and
shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless and
solely to the extent any such materials or information is the subject of any
express representation or warranty set forth in Article III of this Agreement.

5.2 Employment Matters.

  

  

(a) During the six (6) month period commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the Target Company to provide to employees of the Target Company
on the Closing Date, including employees not actively at work due to injury,
vacation, military duty, disability or other leave of absence (collectively,
the "Affected Employees") benefits (including benefits to spouses and other
beneficiaries of the Affected Employees), that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to the benefits listed on Annex III that Buyer or
Buyer's Parent provides to similarly situated employees. The Target Company
shall pay to each applicable Affected Employee all amounts under any bonus or
incentive arrangement which, as of Closing, are accrued as Current
Liabilities. The employee benefit plans maintained or required to be
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, as applicable, the Target
Company) to provide benefits to any Affected Employee after the Closing,
including the Continuing Company Benefit Plans (as defined in Section 5.2(b)),
are referred to herein collectively as the "Target Company Benefit Plans").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) During the six (6) month period commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause the Target Company to (i) continue to maintain and administer
without amendment (except as may be required under applicable Law) the
Severance Plan and the Stay Bonus Plan (collectively, the "Continuing Company
Benefit Plans"), and (ii) pay (subject to Section 5.2(c) below in the case of
the Stay Bonus Plan) all benefits due under the Continuing Company Benefit
Plans. Buyer expressly agrees that if any severance benefits are payable to
any Affected Employee under the Severance Plan, the "base pay" (as defined in
the Severance Plan) used for calculation of the amount of severance pay will
not reflect any reduction in base pay effected by Buyer after Closing.

  

  

(c) (i) At Closing, Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Stay Bonus
Escrow Amount to be held in an escrow account (the "Stay Bonus Escrow
Account") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement among Seller, the Target Company,
Buyer and the Escrow Agent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Stay
Bonus Escrow Agreement"), to provide a source of funds for the payments that
the Target Company may be required to make under the Stay Bonus Plan. The
Escrow Agent shall hold and distribute the funds in the Stay Bonus Escrow
Account in accordance with the provisions of the Stay Bonus Escrow Agreement.
Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that (A) the Stay Bonus Escrow Account
shall not secure the indemnification obligations of Seller and Seller's Parent
hereunder, and (B) any excess funds that remain in the Stay Bonus Escrow
Account after the Target Company processes all of the stay bonuses due to
employees shall be released to Seller pursuant to the terms of the Stay Bonus
Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(ii) If any employee becomes entitled to receive his or her stay bonus
pursuant to the Stay Bonus Plan (as in effect as of Closing), the Target
Company shall request the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Target Company from
the Stay Bonus Escrow Subaccount an amount equal to the applicable bonus
amount and the Target Company shall effect payment of the bonus to such
employee as and when due in accordance with the terms of his or her Stay Bonus
Agreement.

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company Benefit Plans that are
not Continuing Company Benefit Plans shall be, as of the Closing Date,
sponsored or maintained by Seller or one of its Affiliates, as the case may
be, and that as of the Closing Date, coverage of the Affected Employees under
the Company Benefit Plans that are not Continuing Company Benefit Plans shall
terminate. Buyer and the Target Company shall not be responsible for any
claims relating to or liabilities under the Company Benefit Plans, whether
arising prior to or after the Closing, other than the liabilities specified in
this Section 5.2.

  

  

(e) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Target Company Benefit
Plans, and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and
severance benefits under the Target Company Benefit Plans, each Affected
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Target
Company and its Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
owner of the Station) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Affected
Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under
any similar Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, but subject to applicable Laws: (i) each Affected
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all Target Company Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under
such Target Company Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Affected Employee participated before the
replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each Target Company Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability and/or death
benefits to any Affected Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Target Company
Benefit Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) As of the Closing Date, those Affected Employees participating in the LME
Retirement Plus Plan (the "Landmark 401(k) Plan"), a defined contribution
plan, described in Section 401(k) of the Code, shall be considered terminated
participants. As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing
Date, Seller shall advise Affected Employees who participate in the Landmark
401(k) Plan (the "Affected Employee Participants") of their right to elect to
receive a distribution of, or to rollover, their individual account balances
from the Landmark 401(k) Plan. To the extent permitted by Law, Seller and
Buyer agree, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, that such
amounts may be transferred by the Affected Employee Participants to the 401(k)
plan maintained by Buyer (the "Buyer's 401(k) Plan") in a direct rollover. As
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall take
such action as is reasonably necessary to enable the Affected Employee
Participants to rollover any promissory notes held in connection with plan
loans made to Affected Employee participants under the Landmark 401(k) Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that either or both of the
Landmark 401(k) Plan and the Buyer's 401(k) Plan cannot accommodate the
aforementioned rollover of the Landmark 401(k) Plan promissory notes through
plan amendments or negotiation with the respective plan vendors, the Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve a mutually
satisfactory resolution of the Landmark 401(k) Plan promissory notes.

  

  

(g) Seller shall be responsible for, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Target Company), shall have no liability under the Landmark 401(k) Plan,
the Landmark Retiree Medical Plan and Trust or the defined benefit pension
plan sponsored by Seller (the "Landmark Pension Plan").

  

  

(h) On the Closing Date, except as specified in Section 5.2(b) and (c) above,
the Target Company shall cease to be a participating company in any and all
fringe, health and welfare benefit plans, programs and policies (including the
health care reimbursement plans and dependent care reimbursement plans, the
treatment of which is described in Section 5.2(k)) sponsored by Seller or its
Affiliate that provide benefits to current and former employees of the Target
Company and their dependents and beneficiaries, or any successor plans,
programs or policies thereto, as any such plan, program or policy may be
amended and in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Landmark
Health and Welfare Plans"). Subject to Section 5.2(b) and (c) above, the
liabilities and obligations under the Landmark Health and Welfare Plans,
including all liabilities that pertain to the current and former employees of
the Target Company and their dependents and beneficiaries (including claims
that as of the Closing Date have been incurred but not reported or paid) shall
at all times remain liabilities of Seller, and Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Target Company) shall have no liability in respect thereof. For
purposes of any disability plan of Seller or Target Company, a disability is
incurred when the events giving rise to the claim under such plan have
occurred regardless of when the claim is made.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Buyer shall be responsible for providing pursuant to group health plans
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliate (including, as applicable, the Target
Company) any and all legally mandated continuation coverage of group health
benefits under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the
Code or any other Law for the current and former employees of the Target
Company and their qualified beneficiaries who have a loss of health care
coverage under any Benefit Plan that is or was a group health benefit plan due
to a qualifying event occurring on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall be
responsible for providing such legally mandated coverage for current and
former employees of Target Company and their qualified beneficiaries whose
qualifying event occurred prior to Closing.

  

  

(j) On the Closing Date, the Target Company shall cease to be named as an
insured under any plan, program or policy sponsored by Seller or its Affiliate
that provides workers compensation coverage to current and former employees of
the Target Company (the "Landmark Workers Compensation Policy") and Buyer
shall cause the Target Company to have coverage in respect of post-Closing
Date occurrences. None of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Target
Company) shall have any liability under the Landmark Workers Compensation
Policy.

  

  

(k) Following the Closing Date, Seller shall offer "COBRA-like coverage"
through the end of the applicable plan year to the Affected Employees who
immediately prior to Closing are participants ("Target Company FSA
Participants") in the Health Care Reimbursement Plan under the Landmark
Flexible Benefits Plan, or any successor plan(s) thereto, as either may be
amended and in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Landmark
FSAs"). To the extent Target Company FSA Participants elect the "COBRA-like
coverage," the Seller shall pay for one hundred percent (100%) of the COBRA-
like premium ("COBRA-like Premium") through the remainder of the applicable
plan year. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for one hundred percent (100%) of the
COBRA-like Premium within thirty (30) days following the end of the applicable
plan year. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall amend its Dependent Care
Reimbursement Plan to allow Target Company FSA Participants in the Dependent
Care Reimbursement Plan under the Landmark FSA to see reimbursement of
expenses incurred after the Closing Date but during the remainder of the plan
year of such plan (and any grace periods).

  

  

(l) On the Closing Date, Affected Employees who are participants in the
Deferred Compensation Plan shall cease to be active participants in the
Deferred Compensation Plan. None of Buyer nor its Affiliates (including the
Target Company) shall have any liabilities or obligations under the Deferred
Compensation Plan. Any liabilities and obligations under the Deferred
Compensation Plan shall be discharged by Seller in accordance with the written
terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. For purposes of the Deferred
Compensation Plan, Seller will treat Affected Employees who were participants
in the Deferred Compensation Plan as of Closing as having incurred a
"separation from service" as defined under Code Section 409A.

  

  

(m) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.12 hereof, the provisions of
this Section 5.2 are not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any Affected
Employee or former employee of the Target Company any rights or remedies;
provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall affect any vested
rights or remedies of any Affected Employee or any such former employee under
the terms of any Company Benefit Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.3 Publicity. Buyer and Seller agree to communicate with each other and
cooperate with each other prior to any public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree that no public release
or announcement concerning this Agreement or the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of
both Buyer and Seller, except as such release or announcement, upon the advice
of outside counsel, may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any
stock exchange (if any) upon which the securities of Buyer or its Affiliates
are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement, to the extent practicable, shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

  

  

5.4 Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Buyer and its Representatives (for purposes of this Section 5.4, as such
term is defined in the confidentiality letter agreement between Landmark Media
Enterprises, LLC and Journal Communications, Inc., dated June 22, 2012 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement")), shall treat all nonpublic information obtained
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
(and if Buyer is not a signatory to the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer
hereby agrees to be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
a party thereto). The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until
the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as provided
in Section 8.2 hereof in accordance with its terms.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing until the second anniversary of Closing, Seller
agrees to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to, treat and
hold as confidential (and, except as otherwise contemplated hereby, not
disclose to or provide any Person access to) Target Company Confidential
Information in its possession. For purposes of the foregoing, "Target Company
Confidential Information" shall mean the Target Company's trade secrets and
other information relating to the Target Company's business plans, budgets,
products, services, assets or liabilities which is non-public, confidential
and proprietary in nature. In the event that Seller or any agent,
representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director of Seller becomes
legally compelled to disclose any such information, Seller shall provide Buyer
and the Target Company with written notice of such requirement as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and to the extent permissible by applicable Law, so
that Buyer or the Target Company may at their sole cost and expense seek a
protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Section 5.4. In
the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Buyer
waives compliance with this Section 5.4, Seller shall furnish only that
portion of such confidential information which Seller is advised by opinion of
counsel is legally required to be provided.

  

 

  

5.5 Access to Information; Notification.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.4 hereof, during the period beginning on the date of
this Agreement and ending on the earlier of the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall cause its
Representatives to afford the Representatives of Buyer reasonable access
during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities of the Target Company and its books and records,
including access to any Real Property to conduct surveys, tower inspections or
environmental assessments thereof (subject, in the case of Leased Real
Property, to the express written consent of the landlord prior to such
access), and shall furnish Buyer with such financial, operating and other data
and information with respect to the Target Company, as Buyer, through its
Representatives, may reasonably request. In exercising its rights hereunder,
Buyer shall conduct itself so as not to interfere in any material respect with
the conduct of the business of the Target Company prior to Closing and shall
comply with all of the Target Company's safety and security requirements.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any contact by Buyer and its
Representatives with officers, employees, customers or agents of the Target
Company hereunder shall be arranged through and supervised by representatives
of Seller (using Deborah F. Turner as the primary point of contact at the
Station), unless Seller otherwise expressly consents with respect to any
specific contact. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Target
Company) shall be required to disclose to Buyer or any agent or representative
thereof any (i) information (A) relating to any sale or divestiture process
conducted by Seller or its Affiliates for any of Seller's or its Affiliates'
business (including the business of the Target Company) or Seller's or its
Affiliates' (or their Representatives') evaluation of the Target Company or
its business in connection therewith, including projections, financial or
other information relating thereto, (B) if doing so could violate any Contract
or Law to which Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Target Company)
is a party or is subject or (C) which it believes in good faith could result
in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege
(including the attorney-client and work product privileges), or (ii)
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return of which Seller or any
current or former Affiliate is the common parent or any other information
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns other than information relating solely to the
Target Company.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to Seller and its Representatives access, during normal
business hours, to such information and assistance relating to the Target
Company as is necessary for any reasonable business purpose, including
financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any
Tax Return, the defense of any Tax claim or assessment, in connection with any
disclosure obligation or the defense of any Action. In exercising its rights
hereunder, Seller shall conduct itself so as not to interfere in any material
respect with the conduct of the business of Buyer or the Target Company and
will reimburse Buyer for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in
connection with furnishing Seller requested documents. Buyer shall make all
reasonable accommodations to assist Seller when Seller exercises its rights
hereunder.

  

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall require any party to take any action
that would (i) constitute a waiver of, or result in an impairment of, the
attorney-client or other privilege held by such party, (ii) violate any
applicable Law, or (iii) violate any agreement with any third party regarding
the confidentiality of information relating to that third party or its
business.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) At all times prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the
other party in writing of the discovery of any fact or condition, or the
occurrence of any event, that will or is reasonably likely to result in the
failure of any of the conditions contained in Article VI to be satisfied.

  

  

(e) Between the thirtieth (30th) day after the date hereof and the Closing,
upon reasonable notice and at Buyer's expense, Seller shall (i) afford Buyer
and its auditors reasonable access to the books and records and financial and
operational data of the Target Company and Seller (solely as it relates to the
Target Company) relating to the periods prior to the Closing, in order to
permit Buyer to prepare to conduct a financial audit for calendar years 2009,
2010, 2011 and 2012, such as may be necessary, or financial review of any
calendar quarter of 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 or 2013, and (ii) provide Buyer and
its auditors with reasonable assistance compiling information relating to the
Target Company's operations during such periods, whether held by the Target
Company, Seller or Seller's Parent, to the extent that such information (A) is
not otherwise contained in the accessed books. records and data, and (B) is
reasonably necessary to permit Buyer to obtain from its auditors (after
Closing) audited financial statements for the periods set forth above;
provided that in each case such access and assistance shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the Target Company's and the Seller's respective
businesses, shall not require Seller to compile information other than
information that is in the possession and at the disposal of the Target
Company, Seller or Seller's Parent (e.g., Seller shall not be required to
produce special studies), and shall be subject to routine work paper access
and release protocols.

  

  

5.6 Filings and Authorizations, HSR Act Filing and FCC Application. During the
period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the earlier of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms:

  

  

(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable on their respective parts, (i) to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all filings, applications and other materials necessary in
connection with Governmental Approvals (including filing by September 14, 2012
all filings, applications and other materials required under the HSR Act, with
a request for early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act) and
(ii) to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all Governmental
Approvals and other consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. To the
extent practicable, Buyer and Seller will (A) consult the other on all
information relating to Seller, the Target Company or Buyer, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) provide the other in
advance of filing copies of such portions of the draft filings as the other
party may reasonably request. In exercising the foregoing right, each of Buyer
and Seller shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) (i) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the parties' obligations
under Section 5.6(a) above, on or before September 10, 2012, Buyer and Seller
shall prepare and file with the FCC applications requesting FCC consent to the
transfer of control of the FCC Licenses from Seller to Buyer (collectively,
the "FCC Application"). After filing, Buyer and Seller shall diligently
prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain the FCC Consent as promptly as practicable. Each party shall
promptly provide to the other party a copy of any pleading, order or other
document served on them relating to any such FCC Application. In addition,
each party further covenants and agrees to (A) prepare, file and prosecute any
alternative application, petition, motion, request or other filing (including
any motion for leave to withdraw or dismiss any FCC Application filed by the
parties with the FCC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby)
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Additional Applications"); and (B) cooperate in good faith with the other
party with respect to the foregoing, all as may be necessary, appropriate or
advisable in order to obtain FCC Consent or otherwise to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Closing shall not have
occurred for any reason within the original effective period of any FCC
Consent, and neither party shall have properly terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, the parties shall jointly request an extension of the
effective period of such FCC Consent; provided, no extension of the effective
period of any FCC Consent shall limit any right of either party under Section
8.1.

  

  

(ii) Each party agrees to comply with any condition imposed on it by any FCC
Consent, except that no party shall be required to accept any condition
imposed by the FCC that is reasonably likely to materially and adversely
affect such party's financial condition, assets, results of operations or
business, taken as a whole. Buyer and Seller shall oppose any petitions to
deny or other objections filed with respect to any FCC Application and any
requests for reconsideration or review of any FCC Consent.

  

  

(c) Buyer and Seller shall each keep the other informed of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices, documents, or
orders or summaries of other communications received by Buyer or Seller, the
Target Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, as
the case may be, from any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby within three (3) Business Days after receipt thereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall also
provide one another with advance notice of any proposed discussions or
meetings with any Governmental Entity in connection with permitting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall provide one
another with an opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings.

  

 

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 5.6, Seller and Buyer (in all cases below) agree to take or cause to
be taken the following actions: (i) provide promptly to any Governmental
Entity information and documents requested by any Governmental Entity or as
are otherwise necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) in the event that, after substantial
compliance with all requests for information, any complaint or challenge by
any Governmental Entity seeking a preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order (in all cases other than a request for information) becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be made or filed and such injunction or other order would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby unlawful or would prevent
or prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, take
promptly all reasonable steps necessary to prevent, vacate, modify or suspend
such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as
close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement. In addition to and
not in limitation of any other obligation contained in this Agreement, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall commit to any and all divestitures, licenses or hold
separate or similar arrangements with respect to their assets or conduct of
business arrangements which (A) relate to any market in Tennessee, and (B) are
a condition to obtaining any and all approvals, including, without limitation,
the FCC Consent, from any Governmental Entity for any reason in order to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the Outside Date,
including taking any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no
requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent or approval of any authority
enforcing applicable antitrust Laws or other Governmental Entity, (y) no
decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order
in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust
Laws, would preclude consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Outside Date.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.7 Reasonable Best Efforts. During the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending on the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms:

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, and without limiting the obligations of
the parties under Section 5.6, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or
cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other party hereto in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby (the foregoing
notwithstanding, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall be solely
responsible with respect to the requirements of its Financing).

  

  

(b) Each party hereto shall inform the other within three (3) Business Days of
receipt thereof of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
any Governmental Approval or otherwise regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If any party or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to a Governmental
Approval or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as practicable and after consultation with the other
party, a response that complies with such request.

  

 

  

(c) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall
make appropriate requests and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and deliver as expeditiously as possible (i) all notices and third
party consents necessary under any Specified Company Contract (which shall not
require any payment to any such third party, except as provided in the
immediately succeeding sentence), and (ii) all notices and consent and
estoppel certificates by lessors necessary under any Company Leases, if any,
in the case of both clause (i) and (ii) to the extent that Buyer specifically
requests Seller to deliver such notice or obtain any such third party consent
or estoppel certificate. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, shall each be responsible for and pay one-half of all administrative or
processing fees imposed by a Person pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Specified Company Contract or Company Lease as a condition to processing any
consent or estoppel certificate request. Seller shall consult with Buyer in
connection with the preparation of the forms of consent and estoppel
certificate and shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of
obtaining any such consents and estoppel certificates. Buyer will not be
required to accept or agree or accede to any condition to transfer any
Specified Company Contract or Company Lease, or any modifications or
amendments to such Specified Company Contract or Company Lease that would
make, or are reasonably likely to make, the underlying Specified Company
Contract or Company Lease materially more onerous in the aggregate or that
would materially reduce, or be reasonably likely to materially reduce, the
benefits available under the Specified Company Contract or Company Lease in
respect of which the consent or estoppel certificate relates. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the obligation of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not subject to Seller
delivering any notice or obtaining any third party consent with respect to any
Specified Company Contract or any estoppel certificate with respect to any
Company Lease other than as described in Annex I. Nothing in this Section
5.7(c) shall limit Section 5.12 below.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.8 Compliance with WARN Act and Similar Statutes. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause the Target Company not to, at any time within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, effectuate (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act))
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of the Target Company or (ii) a
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or
facility of the Target Company; or, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), any
similar action under any comparable Law requiring notice to employees in the
event of a plant closing or layoff. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer
shall be responsible for notices or payments due to any employees, and all
notices, payments, fines or assessments due to any Governmental Entity,
pursuant to any applicable federal, state, local or foreign Law with respect
to the employment, discharge or layoff of any employees by Buyer or the Target
Company on or after the Closing, including the WARN Act or any comparable Law.
(For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be responsible for notices or
payments due to any employees, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments
due to any Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable federal, state,
local or foreign Law with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of
any employees by Seller or the Target Company prior to the Closing, including
the WARN Act or any comparable Law.)

  

  

5.9 Resignations. Seller shall cause each of the directors and officers of the
Target Company listed in Section 5.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to
deliver a written resignation from each such position, effective as of the
Closing Date.

  

  

5.10 Insurance Coverage.

  

  

(a) The Target Company shall not have post-Closing coverage under the
insurance policies and self-insurance programs of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Target Company), including, without limitation, the
policies and programs described in Section 3.19 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; provided, however, that, subject to Section 5.10(b) below, with
respect to insurance coverage written on an "occurrence basis" or "claims made
basis," to the extent the Target Company is insured under such policies and
subject to applicable requirements or limitations in such policies, the Target
Company shall be entitled to seek enforcement of claims under such policies to
the extent the occurrences or wrongful acts or circumstances giving rise to a
claim under such policies occurred prior to the Effective Time and, in the
case of a claim under a claims made policy, the claim was properly made with
the insurer prior to the Effective Time. At Buyer's sole cost and expense,
Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer (i) in Buyer's assertion and
prosecution of such claims under Seller's insurance policies and (ii) by
executing appropriate assignments to the extent permitted by law, and the
Seller shall remit any recoveries promptly to the Buyer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If between the date hereof and Closing, the Target Company suffers damage
(excluding any damage resulting from ordinary wear and tear) or loss to any of
its tangible property, whether now owned or acquired prior to Closing,
excluding tangible property that is obsolete or unnecessary for the continued
operation of the Target Company or Station (an "Interim Closing Casualty
Loss"), Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of (A) the applicable Interim
Closing Casualty Loss, (B) whether such loss is covered by insurance and the
amount of any insurance retention, and (C) the action that Seller intends to
take in order to repair or replace the property subject to the Interim Closing
Casualty Loss to substantially the same condition as existed immediately prior
to the applicable loss. Seller shall at its cost and expense complete such
repair or replacement prior to Closing if reasonably practicable, and in such
case Seller shall be entitled to retain all insurance proceeds, except to the
extent such insurance proceeds expressly include business continuation
insurance proceeds in respect of periods of operation after Closing. In the
event Seller is unable to complete the applicable repair or replacement prior
to Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer for its review and approval, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, prior to Closing a description of
the unfinished work or procurement and the special capital expenditure budget
adequate to cover the cost to repair or replace the property subject to the
Interim Closing Casualty Loss to substantially the same condition as existed
immediately prior to the applicable loss (the "Special Reserve Liability"). In
such case, any insurance proceeds received by Target Company, Seller or Buyer
under Seller's policies shall be used to first reimburse Seller for the amount
of the Special Reserve Liability and then any excess amount shall be divided
equally between Buyer and Seller, provided that any business continuance
insurance proceeds shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer based on their
respective losses prior to or from and after Closing, as applicable, as
determined by the insurance carrier (or if the carrier fails to make that
determination, a mutually acceptable independent third party). Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate with each other and with the applicable insurance
carrier(s) to expeditiously adjudicate claims in respect of Interim Closing
Casualty Losses and assign proceeds in conformity with the foregoing. In the
event of any Interim Closing Casualty Loss occurring within ten (10) days
prior to Closing, the parties shall, acting in good faith and reasonably,
establish the Special Reserve Liability in the Revised Closing Balance Sheet
in a mutually acceptable manner.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the forgoing, at Closing, Buyer shall cause the Target
Company to be covered by such policies of commercial insurance as are
customary for businesses in the television broadcast industry.

  

 

  

(d) If reasonably practicable, prior to Closing, Seller shall install on the
Station's transmitter tower such additional lighting as may be necessary to
cause the lighting to comply with current FAA regulations (without regard to
any grandfathering rules). In the event Seller is unable to complete the
installation prior to Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer for its review
and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, prior to Closing
a description of the unfinished work and a special capital expenditure budget
adequate to cover the cost to complete the work, which budgeted amount shall
be added to and become a part of any Special Reserve Liability.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.11 Provision of Certain Services.

  

  

(a) Buyer acknowledges that the Target Company currently receives from Seller
and its Affiliates the administrative and corporate services and the benefits
described in Section 5.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Support
Services"). Seller, the Target Company and Buyer acknowledge and agree that,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and
the Continuing Arrangements (in each case, if at all), the Support Services
shall cease at Closing, and all agreements and arrangements (whether or not in
writing) in respect thereof shall terminate as of the Closing Date, with no
further obligation of any party thereto.

  

  

(b) Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that from and after Closing, the
Target Company shall cease to have any rights under, or otherwise be a
beneficiary of, the Contracts listed under Section 5.11(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and Buyer shall be solely responsible to cause the Target
Company to obtain a separate contract with respect to the subject matter of
such contracts.

  

  

5.12 Retransmission Agreements.

  

  

(a) Prior to Closing, (i) Seller or Seller's Affiliate shall give notice of
the sale transaction contemplated hereby to each MVPD identified in Section
5.12(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms of
the Retransmission Agreement with that MVPD, as identified on the schedule
(such Retransmission Agreements, the "Parent Level Retransmission
Agreements"), and (ii) Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each such MVPD to agree in writing (a "Special MVPD Agreement") that from and
after Closing, (A) the Station shall cease to be covered by the Parent Level
Retransmission Agreement and Seller and Seller's Affiliate shall be released
and discharged in respect of any obligations or liabilities under the Parent
Level Retransmission Agreement in respect of the Station, and (B) the Station
shall be added to Buyer's existing retransmission agreement with such MVPD or
otherwise covered by Buyer's own retransmission consent agreement with the
MVPD. Seller shall provide Buyer with such assistance as Buyer may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. If prior to Closing, Buyer is unable
to obtain a Special MVPD Agreement with respect to a Parent Level
Retransmission Agreement, then, at Closing, Seller (or Seller's Affiliate, as
applicable) and the Target Company shall execute and deliver an assignment and
assumption agreement by which (1) the rights of Seller (or Seller's Affiliate)
under the Parent Level Retransmission Agreement in respect of (and solely in
respect of) the Station with respect to periods from and after Closing are
assigned to the Target Company, (2) the obligations and liabilities of Seller
(or Seller's Affiliate) under the Parent Level Retransmission Agreement in
respect of (and solely in respect of) the Station with respect to periods from
and after Closing are assumed by the Target Company, and (3) the Target
Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and Seller's
Affiliates from any and all claims, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses
in respect of the assumed obligations and liabilities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) After Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Target Company to, give
notice of the consummation of Closing to the MVPDs identified in Section
5.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule in accordance with the terms of the
respective Retransmission Agreements with those MVPDs, as identified on the
schedule.

  

  

5.13 Use of Certain Marks. Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Target
Company to, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date, cease to (i) make any use of any names or
Trademarks that include the terms (A) "Landmark", "Landmark Media Enterprises"
or "Landmark Television", or any other Trademark used by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Target Company), and (B) any names or Trademarks
related thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing, including any names
or Trademarks confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof (the "Seller
Marks"), and (ii) hold themselves out as having any affiliation with Seller or
any of its Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable but in
no event later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause the Target Company to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all
Seller Marks from all assets and other materials owned by the Target Company,
including, without limitation, any vehicles, business cards, schedules,
stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials,
manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and other materials and
systems. Any use by the Target Company of any of the Seller Marks as permitted
in this Section 5.13 shall be subject to the Target Company's compliance with
Seller's quality control requirements and guidelines.

  

  

5.14 Conduct of Business by Buyer Pending Closing. Buyer covenants and agrees
with Seller and the Target Company that between the date hereof and the
Closing or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article VIII, except as may be consented to in writing by Seller and Target
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Buyer:

  

  

(a) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any of its
Organizational Documents of Buyer or any of its respective Subsidiaries in any
manner that would be likely to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby;

  

  

(b) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take or agree to
take any other action that would be reasonably likely to prevent or cause a
material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VI
or the Closing; and

  

  

(c) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire or agree
to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or
any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any
Governmental Approvals or other authorizations, consents, orders, declarations
or approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) materially increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise or (iv)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

  

 

  

5.15 Control of the Station. Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not, directly
or indirectly, control, manage, supervise or direct, or attempt to control,
manage, supervise or direct, the operations of the Station, and such
operations, including complete control, management and supervision of all the
Station's programs, employees and policies, shall be the sole responsibility
of Seller and the Target Company until the consummation of the Closing
hereunder.

  

  

5.16 Financing Activities.

  

  

(a) Each Buyer's Parent and Buyer shall use (and shall cause their Affiliates
to use) their best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing and the Financing Documents, including by
complying with its obligations under the Financing Commitments, (ii) arrange
and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitments, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive financing
agreements with respect to the Financing on terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitments, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly
as practicable but in any event no later than the Closing Date (any definitive
agreements entered into in respect of the Financing being referred to as the
"Financing Agreements"), and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to
Closing. Buyer's Parents and Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of all
documents relating to the Financing and shall keep Seller informed on a
reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of material developments in
respect of the financing process relating thereto, including by from time to
time advising Seller of the status of the Financing. Prior to the Closing,
each Buyer's Parent and Buyer shall not (and shall not permit their Affiliates
to) agree to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver under,
the Financing Commitments or other documentation relating to the Financing
without the prior written consent of Seller.

  

  

(b) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the
manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments (or any
Financing Agreement relating thereto), (i) Buyer's Parents and Buyer shall
immediately notify Seller and (ii) Buyer's Parents and Buyer shall use their
best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, including
by entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto (any such
definitive agreements in respect of alternative financing also shall
constitute Financing Agreements hereunder). Each Buyer's Parent and Buyer
shall (x) furnish to Seller complete, correct and executed copies of the
Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give Seller prompt
notice of any breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments, any
alternative and/or supplemental financing commitment, or the Financing
Agreements of which either Buyer's Parent or Buyer becomes aware or any
termination thereof and (z) otherwise keep Seller reasonably informed of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacement and/or
supplement thereof). Each Buyer's Parent and Buyer shall, shall cause their
Affiliates to, and shall use their best efforts to cause their Representatives
to, comply with the terms, and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions, of
the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitments, the
Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material
breach of the Financing Commitments, the Financing Agreements, any alternative
financing commitment and any related fee and engagement letter by either
Buyer's Parent or Buyer shall be deemed a breach by Buyer's Parents and Buyer
of this Section 5.16.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) In the event that all conditions in Section 6.1 of this Agreement have
been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, each Buyer's Parent and
Buyer shall use their best efforts to cause such Persons providing such
Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Financing, including by enforcing
their rights under the Financing Commitments to cause the Financing to be
funded at the Closing. Each Buyer's Parent and Buyer acknowledge and agree
that (i) the Closing is not conditioned on the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing arrangement, and (ii) Seller shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of each Buyer's Parent and Buyer's obligations under
this Section 5.16, including Buyer's Parents and Buyer's obligation to enforce
their rights under the Financing Commitments to cause the Financing to be
funded at Closing.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Seller and
Seller's Parent (and any of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
including the Target Company, directors, officers, employees, representatives
or agents) agrees that it will not bring any Action, including any cross-claim
or third party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Financing
Documents, the Financing (or any other financing of all or a portion of the
Purchase Price) or in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Financing Commitments, the
Financing Documents or Financing (or any other financing of all or a portion
of the Purchase Price), including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Financing Documents, the Financing Commitments or any agreement
entered into by the Financing Sources in connection with the Financing (or any
other financing of all or a portion of the Purchase Price) or the performance
thereof; provided that nothing herein shall limit Seller's rights against
Buyer and Buyer's Parents under Section 5.16(c). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Financing Sources" means the Lenders and any Person that provides,
or has or in the future enters into any Contract with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to provide, any of the Financing (or any other financing of all or
a portion of the Purchase Price), any of such Person's Affiliates and any of
such Person's or any of its Affiliates' respective current, former or future
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, stockholders, limited
partners, managers, members or partners.

  

  

5.17 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
Tax Returns with respect to the Target Company (or that include the Target
Company on a consolidated or combined basis) for taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Periods"). If the due date of a Tax
Return for the Target Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period is before the
Closing Date, Seller or an Affiliate of Seller shall file, or cause to be
filed, such Tax Return on a timely basis. If the due date for such a Tax
Return is after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver such Tax Return to
Buyer not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return
and Buyer shall cause the Tax Return to be timely filed. All such Tax Returns
shall be complete and correct in all material respects. Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. Seller
shall reimburse Buyer to the extent Buyer pays any Taxes payable with respect
to the Target Company for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall file, or cause the Target Company to
file, on a timely basis all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the
Target Company for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. All such Tax
Returns shall be complete and correct in all material respects. Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
To the extent any such Tax Returns are for a taxable year or period that
commences before and ends after the Closing Date ("Straddle Period"), Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for all Taxes payable by the Target Company which are
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period deemed to end on the Closing
Date. For purposes of this Section 5.17(b), whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of the Target Company for a Straddle Period,
the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following
the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and
state and local apportionment factors of the Target Company for the Straddle
Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a
"closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Target Company
were closed at the close of the Closing Date. However, (i) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation and (ii) periodic taxes such real and personal
property taxes shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily
basis. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to filing, Buyer shall deliver
all proposed Tax Returns for Straddle Periods to Seller for Seller's review,
and Buyer shall accept all changes to such returns reasonably requested by
Seller.

  

  

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller and their Affiliates will provide the other with
such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return with respect to the Target Company, any
audit or other examination by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Target Company, any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liabilities for Taxes of the Target Company, and each will retain and provide
the others with any records or information that may be relevant to any such
Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or claims. Such assistance shall
include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and
shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax Returns and supporting work
schedules. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other
for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance.
Seller hereby agrees that it will retain, until all appropriate statutes of
limitation (including any extensions) expire, copies of all Tax Returns filed
by the Target Company prior to the Closing Date and all supporting work
schedules and other records or information which may be relevant to such Tax
Returns. To the extent that any taxing authority proposes an increase in Taxes
for which Seller could be responsible for under the terms of this Agreement,
Seller (at its own expense) shall be entitled to actively participate in the
defense against such increase in Taxes and neither Buyer, the Target Company
nor any person affiliated with Buyer or the Target Company shall agree to pay
any portion of the proposed increase in Taxes without first obtaining the
written agreement of Seller (which agreement shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.18 Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the period from the Closing Date
through the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not in any way, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or employ any officers or employees of the Target Company, or
induce or attempt to induce any of them to leave the employ of the Target
Company or violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment
arrangements, with the Target Company; provided, however, that the foregoing
will not (A) prohibit the hiring of any Person pursuant to a general
solicitation to the public of general advertising or (B) apply to any
Affiliate at such time as it ceases to be an Affiliate of Seller. Seller
acknowledges that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.18 are an
essential element of this Agreement. Seller has independently consulted with
its counsel and after such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in
this Section 5.18 are reasonable and proper. Seller agrees and acknowledges
that remedies at law for any breach of its obligations under this Section 5.18
are inadequate and that, in addition thereto, Buyer shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event
of any such breach.

  

  

5.19 No Shop. From the date hereof until the earlier of Closing or termination
of this Agreement, neither Seller nor any Affiliate, agent or representative
of Seller shall directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate or encourage
submission or accept any proposal or offer from any Person relating to any
acquisition or purchase of (i) the assets of the Target Company not permitted
under Section 5.1(a)(vii) or (ii) the Equity Interests of the Target Company
(each, an "Acquisition Proposal"), or (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish to any person or entity any information with
respect to, or otherwise assist, facilitate, encourage or participate in or
cooperate with, any effort or attempt by any person or entity to make or
effect an Acquisition Proposal (provided that if Seller receives an
Acquisition Proposal, Seller may advise the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal that an exclusivity agreement is in effect and Seller is unable to
engage in discussions while the agreement is in effect).

ARTICLE VII

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

7.1 Indemnification by Seller. Subject to Section 7.5, from and after Closing,
Seller and Seller's Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against any
claim, expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, liability or
loss (collectively, "Losses"), whether or not involving a Third Party Claim,
suffered, sustained, incurred or paid by any Buyer Indemnitee which arises out
of, results from or relates to:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or Seller's
Parent in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to Section
6.1(a)(iii);

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant made by Seller in this Agreement;

  

  

(c) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by any such Person with Seller or Seller's Parent or, prior to the
Closing, the Target Company (or any Person acting on their behalf other than
Buyer or its Representatives) in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or

  

  

(d) the matters set forth in Annex IV.

  

  

7.2 Indemnification by Buyer. From and after Closing, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (the "Seller Indemnitees")
from and against any Losses, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim,
suffered, sustained, incurred or paid by any Seller Indemnitee which arise out
of, result from or relate to:

  

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer or either
Buyer's Parent in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 6.2(a)(iii);

  

  

(b) any breach of any covenant made by Buyer or either Buyer's Parent in this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any breach by Buyer or either
Buyer's Parent of any obligation in this Agreement to cause the Target Company
and its post-Closing Subsidiaries to perform any of their post-Closing
obligations under this Agreement, if any); or

  

  

(c) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by any such Person with Buyer or either Buyer's Parent in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

7.3 Indemnification Procedure--Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of a claim from a
third party (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party shall, if a claim is to be
made against an indemnifying party, promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
days of receiving the Third Party Claim) give notice to the indemnifying party
of such Third Party Claim, which notice shall include a reasonably specific
description of the basis for such claim, a reasonable estimate of the amount
of asserted Losses (to the extent the indemnified party is able to estimate
such Losses), copies of all documents relating to the claim, and such other
material information as is reasonably available regarding the Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to notify or any delay in
notifying the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party of
any liability that it may have to any indemnified party, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such action is
prejudiced by the indemnified party's failure to give or delay in giving such
notice, and then only to the extent of such prejudice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The indemnifying party will have the right to defend the indemnified party
against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. In the event that the indemnifying
party undertakes defense of or opposition to any Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party, by counsel or other representative of its own choosing and
at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with the
indemnifying party and its counsel concerning such Third Party Claim, and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and their respective counsel
shall cooperate in good faith with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(c) Unless and until the indemnifying party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim, the indemnified party may defend against the Third Party Claim in
a manner it deems reasonably appropriate. The indemnified party shall not in
any event consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
indemnifying party.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.3,
the indemnifying party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only
the payment of money damages and does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the indemnified party.

  

  

7.4 Indemnification Procedure-Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for
any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the
party from whom indemnification is sought and shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature of the claim and, if such amount is liquidated and
determinable, the dollar amount of the Loss or, if the dollar amount is not
then liquidated and determinable, a good faith estimate thereof, and shall
include copies of all documents relating to the claim.

  

  

7.5 Limitations.

  

  

(a) From and after the Closing, except in the case of another party's actual
fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy for all claims, whether in contract,
tort, statutory claim or otherwise, resulting from, arising out of, relating
to, in the nature of, or caused by any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach
or inaccuracy, of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder shall be indemnification in
accordance with this Article VII. (For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations
under the Continuing Arrangements are independent obligations and are not
subject to the limitations expressed herein.)

  

 

  

(b) (i) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing. Notwithstanding such survival, after Closing, an
indemnifying party shall not have liability with respect to any breach of a
representation or warranty unless on or before the Expiration Date applicable
to such representation or warranty the indemnified party gives the
indemnifying party written notice, with reasonable specificity (in the manner
contemplated by Section 7.3 or Section 7.4, as applicable), of a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement based on the breach of that
representation or warranty; in that event, the indemnifying party shall remain
liable (subject to the terms and limitations in this Article VII) for Losses
to the extent that they (A) were asserted in the notice of claim, and (B)
arise out of, result from or relate to the breach of the representation or
warranty asserted in such notice. The "Expiration Date" shall be (i) the first
(1st) anniversary of Closing for all representations and warranties other than
the Fundamental Representations/Warranties, and (ii) the third (3rd)
anniversary of Closing in the case of any representation or warranty in any of
the following sections (the "Fundamental Representations/Warranties"): Section
3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3 (excluding subsection (d)), Section 4.1 and
Section 4.2.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) None of the covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing except to the extent such covenants contemplate performance after the
Closing, in which case such covenants shall remain in effect (A) in the case
of Items (i) and (ii) of Annex IV referenced in Section 7.1(d), until the
third anniversary of Closing, (B) in the case of Item (iii) of Annex IV
referenced in Section 7.1(d), until the expiration of the applicable three (3)
year statute of limitations, and (C) in the case of the other covenants, until
performed in accordance with their terms (however, for the avoidance of doubt,
any indemnification obligations in respect of breach of any representation or
warranty shall expire and terminate as provided in Section 7.5(b)(i)).

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Section 7.1):

  

  

(i) Neither Seller nor Seller's Parent shall have any obligation to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Losses under Section 7.1(a) (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, does not include Losses under any item on Annex IV
referenced in Section 7.1(d)), until the aggregate amount of all Losses that
the Buyer Indemnitees have suffered, sustained, incurred and/or paid exceeds
One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), and then Seller and
Seller's Parent shall be liable for Losses only to the extent such aggregate
Losses exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), subject to the other
limitations in this Article VII;

  

  

(ii) Except in the case of another party's actual fraud, the aggregate,
collective liability of Seller and Seller's Parent for Losses under this
Agreement shall not exceed Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the "Cap"),
and neither Seller nor Seller's Parent shall have any obligation to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnities from and against any Losses in excess of the Cap; and

  

  

(iii) Neither Seller nor Seller's Parent shall have any obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Losses to the extent that
the Losses were fully accounted for in calculating the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3.

  

  

(d) Each indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the amount of any Losses for which it is entitled to seek
indemnification hereunder.

  

 

  

(e) In the event that any Losses incurred by a party for purposes of this
Article VII are potentially covered by insurance, the indemnified party agrees
to use reasonable efforts to seek recovery under such insurance and any such
insurance recovery shall reduce the amount of Losses payable by the
indemnified party. If the indemnified party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall promptly reimburse the
indemnifying party for any reasonable payment made or expense incurred by such
indemnifying party in connection with making such indemnification payment up
to and including the amount received by the indemnified party, net of any
expenses incurred by such indemnified party in collecting such amount.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Any calculation of Losses shall be reduced to take into account any net
Tax benefit available to the indemnified party as a result of such Losses.

  

  

(g) The amount of any Loss with respect to which an indemnified party is
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VII after Closing shall
not include consequential, incidental, special, punitive or diminution in
value damages (except, in each case, to the extent awarded by a court of
competent jurisdiction in connection with a claim made by a third party).

  

  

7.6 Indemnification Escrow.

  

  

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall deliver to SunTrust Bank (the "Escrow Agent") the
sum of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Indemnification Escrow Amount")
to be held in an escrow account (the "Indemnification Escrow Account")
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement among Buyer, Seller, Seller's Parent and
Escrow Agent in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "Indemnification
Escrow Agreement") to secure the indemnification obligations of Seller and
Seller's Parent hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall hold and distribute the
funds in the Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with provisions of
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that to the extent Buyer is entitled
to receive any payment in respect of any Losses, such payment shall be
satisfied to the extent possible from the Indemnification Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement before Buyer
seeks recourse against Seller or Seller's Parent personally. For the avoidance
of doubt, for purposes of determining whether the Cap has been met, all sums
paid from the Indemnification Escrow Account to Buyer shall be taken into
account on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

  

  

(c) Seller will be treated as the owner of the Indemnification Escrow Account
for income tax purposes and shall be entitled to withdraw from the
Indemnification Escrow Account the amounts necessary to pay federal, state,
local, income and Medicare taxes on the interest or other income earned.

  

  

7.7 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any amount paid under this Article VII
directly or indirectly to any Buyer Indemnitee shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a final determination of liability by
a Governmental Authority or change in applicable law (including a revenue
ruling or other similar pronouncement) causes any such amount not to
constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

ARTICLE VIII 
 

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

8.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

  

  

(b) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before January 28, 2013 (the "Outside Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)
shall not be available to Seller if the failure of Seller to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;

  

  

(c) by Buyer, by written notice to Seller, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the Outside Date; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to
Buyer if the failure of Buyer to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to such date; provided, further, that if, as of
the Outside Date, all conditions to this Agreement under Section 6.1 above
shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature may be satisfied at the Closing) other than any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(b) or 6.1(c), then Seller may, at its option and in its
sole discretion, extend the Outside Date for purposes of this Section 8.1(c),
from time to time, by up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate (but in no event
shall such extensions extend the Outside Date beyond March 31, 2013);

  

  

(d) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if the conditions set forth in
Section 6.1 of this Agreement are satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and Buyer
does not, within two (2) Business Days of Seller's delivery of such notice of
satisfaction to Buyer, (i) deliver the Closing Payment to Seller in accordance
with Section 6.2(e) and (ii) consummate the Closing;

  

  

(e) by Seller, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Buyer, if
Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and
if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) and (ii) cannot be cured on
or before the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured within thirty (30)
days after Seller gives Buyer written notice stating Seller's intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and the basis for
such termination;

  

  

(f) by Buyer, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Seller, if
Buyer is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and
if Seller shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) and (ii) cannot be cured on
or before the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by the later of (i)
the Outside Date, or (ii) the thirtieth (30th) day after Buyer gives Seller
written notice stating Buyer's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(f) and the basis for such termination; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) by either Seller or Buyer, by written notice to the other party, if any
court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Entity shall
have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable, unless the failure to consummate the Closing because
of such action by a Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated by any party hereto in accordance with Section 8.1 above, this
Agreement shall forthwith terminate and become void and have no effect,
without any liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto (or their
Affiliates or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or other
Representatives), except that (a) any such termination shall not (i) relieve
Seller or Buyer from liability for any fraud or intentional and material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or (ii) if Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(d), relieve Buyer from liability for Buyer's breach of its
obligation to deliver the Closing Payment and consummate the Closing, and (b)
the provisions of, and any liability or obligation contemplated under, Section
5.4(a) (final sentence only), this Section 8.2, and Article IX shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

9.1 Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement and the rights hereunder may
not be assigned by a party (excluding any collateral assignment for the
benefit of the Financing Sources) without the prior written consent of the
other party; provided, however, that Seller may, without Buyer's consent,
assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more of
its Affiliates, so long as Seller notifies Buyer in writing prior to such
assignment and Seller remains liable for its obligations under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and all the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

9.2 Governing Law. As permitted by Section 2708 of Title 6 of the Delaware
Code Annotated, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.3 Specific Performance; Consent to Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) The parties agree and acknowledge that the failure to perform under this
Agreement will be an actual, immediate and irreparable harm and injury and
that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, it is agreed
that, except where this Agreement is properly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Section 5.16)
and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith. The
parties further agree that they shall not object to, or take any position
inconsistent with respect to, whether in a court of law or otherwise, the
appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy for a breach of this
Agreement, and each party waives any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with any such remedy. The parties further agree that
by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.3 a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement, including monetary damages;
provided, however, if a party seeks specific performance as a remedy for
breach of this Agreement and is granted the requested specific performance,
then, in such event (and solely in the event of such granted relief), such
party shall not be entitled to also recover consequential, incidental, special
or punitive damages in respect of the applicable breach, except for its costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, relating to enforcing its
right to specific performance (for the avoidance of doubt, the limitation in
the foregoing proviso shall not in any event apply to direct damages, which
shall be fully recoverable).

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of
itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party in accordance with the terms of Section 9.5 below and nothing in this
Section 9.3 shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law, (ii) irrevocably consents to submit itself and
its property to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts"), in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iv) agrees that any
Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be brought, tried and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware), and (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue of any such Action in any such court or that such Action in
such court was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that a final judgment by a
Chosen Court in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.3(a) or 9.3(b), and
without limiting Seller's rights under Section 5.16(c) or the agreements of
Seller and Seller's Parent under Section 5.16(d), each of the parties hereto
agrees that Buyer's Parents and Buyer will not bring or support any Action,
including any cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to the Financing Commitment
or the Financing Documents, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to any agreement entered into by the Financing Sources in
connection with the Financing (or any other financing of all or a portion of
the Purchase Price) or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
state or federal courts located in the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (and
appellate courts thereof) (it being understood, however, that any Action
relating to this Agreement (including any Action with respect to the Financing
Sources) shall not be brought in any forum other than the state or federal
courts located in Delaware (and appellate courts thereof)). The parties hereto
further agree that all of the provisions of Section 9.4 relating to waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any Action, including any cross-claim or third party
claim referenced in this Section 9.3(c).

  

  

9.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

9.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, including the Seller Disclosure Schedule), and the Ancillary
Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter;
provided, however, for purposes of clarity, it is understood that this

Agreement.

9.9 Interpretation. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Annex, such reference shall
be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or Annex to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor statutes. Any agreement or other contract defined or
referred to herein means such agreement or other contract as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to
currency of the United States of America. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a "director" of the Target Company or Seller, or any of their
Affiliates, such reference shall be to a member of the board of directors or
equivalent board of such entity. The term "or" is not exclusive.

  

  

9.10 Disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed for the purposes of, and
shall qualify, each representation and warranty in the section or subsection
of this Agreement with the corresponding number, and any other representation
or warranty in any other section or subsection of this Agreement where the
relevance of such disclosure to such other representation or warranty is
reasonably apparent, in each case even if there is no reference to the Seller
Disclosure Schedule in any such representation or warranty or the disclosure
in the Seller Disclosure Schedule does not reference any such representation
and warranty, and in the case of any such other representation and warranty
even if the disclosure in the Seller Disclosure Schedule does not reference
the section or subsection of this Agreement in which it is set forth. The
disclosure of a particular item of information in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall not constitute an admission by Seller that such item is
material, that such item has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect or
that the disclosure of such item is required to be made under the terms of
this Agreement.

  

  

9.11 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by
Seller and Buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure
of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligations, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

9.12 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein express or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder, except that each Lender and its Affiliates and their respective
successors and assigns are third-party beneficiaries of Sections 5.16(d), 9.1,
9.3(c), 9.4 and 9.12 of this Agreement, and such provisions shall be
enforceable by the Financing Sources, their respective Affiliates and their
respective successors and assigns (and shall not be amended or modified
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources).

  

  

9.13 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof.

  

  

9.14 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered, shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one
and the same instrument binding upon all of the parties hereto notwithstanding
the fact that all parties are not signatory to the original or the same
counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile or other electronic
signatures shall be deemed originals, and the parties agree to exchange
original signatures as promptly as possible.

  

  

9.15 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5(a), any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

  

  

9.16 No Right of Setoff. No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof may deduct
from, set off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner whatsoever any
amount owed to it hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement against any
amounts owed hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement by such Persons
to the other party hereto or any of such other party's Affiliates.

  

  

9.17 Guaranty.

  

  

(a) Each Buyer's Parent, as a primary obligor and not merely as surety, hereby
absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the full and
prompt payment and performance of any and all obligations and liabilities of
Buyer under this Agreement that are required to be paid or performed at or
prior to Closing, including, without limitation, Buyer\'s obligation to pay
the Closing Payment, the Escrow Amounts and all other payments required to be
made pursuant to Article II or any other provision of this Agreement, and any
and all damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) arising out of or related to any breach of this Agreement by Buyer or
the enforcement of this guarantee (collectively, the "Guaranteed
Obligations").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) The guarantee under this Section 9.17: (i) is a continuing guarantee of
payment and performance and not of collection; (ii) shall be binding upon each
Buyer's Parent, its successors and assigns; (iii) shall inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by Seller and its successors and assigns; and (iv) shall
continue in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations have been
fully paid, performed and satisfied.

  

  

(c) Each Buyer's Parent agrees that: (i) its obligations hereunder shall be
enforceable against it without Seller having to proceed first against Buyer or
pursuing or exhausting any remedy or claim against Buyer or any other
guarantor; (ii) it may be joined in any suit or action against Buyer and
recovery may be had against such Buyer's Parent in such suit or action; and
(iii) the obligations of the Buyer's Parents hereunder are joint and several.

  

  

(d) The obligations and liability of each Buyer's Parent shall not be
discharged, released, affected or impaired by: (i) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or similar proceedings
affecting Buyer, or the disaffirmance or rejection of this Agreement in any
such proceeding; (ii) any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement
or change or extension of the time for payment or performance, or renewal or
alteration of, any obligation hereunder; (iii) the exercise, non-exercise or
delay in exercising, by Seller of any of its rights or remedies; or (iv) any
assignment by Seller of its rights in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

  

  

(e) In the event that any payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is
rescinded or required to be returned, this guarantee shall continue to be
effective and each Buyer's Parent shall remain liable hereunder as if such
payment had not been made.

  

  

(f) Each Buyer's Parent waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance
of this guarantee and of the obligations hereunder, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses which
may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other
similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling
of assets of Buyer, and all suretyship defenses generally, other than any
defenses that are available to Buyer under this Agreement (excluding any
defenses (i) arising from the bankruptcy or insolvency of Buyer, (ii) based on
Buyer's corporate status, power or authority or the validity or enforceability
of Buyer's obligations, (iii) that arise by operation of law, or (iv) that
have been expressly waived).
