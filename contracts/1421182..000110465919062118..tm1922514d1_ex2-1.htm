expenses incurred in connection with this _Section 2.5_. The costs and

proportion as is appropriate to reflect their relative success in the
resolution of the applicable dispute. For example, if Seller challenges the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price by an amount of $100,000, and the
Accounting Firm determines that Seller has a valid claim for $60,000, then
Buyer shall bear 60% of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
Seller shall bear the other 40% of such fees and expenses.

Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ and payment of the Additional
Payment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ in any court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 10.10_. The substance of any
determination of the Accounting Firm shall not be subject to review or
appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest error. It is the intent of the
parties to have any final determination of the Final Purchase Price by the
Accounting Firm proceed in an expeditious manner; _however_ , any deadline or
time period contained herein may be extended or modified by the written
agreement of the parties and the parties agree that the failure of the
Accounting Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained
herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination
rendered by the Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to the terms of this
_Section 2.5_.

  



  

(e)   _Final Payment_. Within five Business Days after the

and thereof will not: (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the

Governmental Authority or any other Person except (i) in the cases of clauses

individually or in the aggregate in the aggregate, in any material respect
adversely affect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Agreements and (ii) in the cases of clauses (b) and (d), other
than any waiting period under the HSR Act, the FERC Approval, the FERC Waiver,

As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Legal Proceeding which is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer which would

Section 4.5   _Financial Capacity_.

  



  

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete copies of
(i) the final and fully executed equity commitment letter, dated the date
hereof, between Buyer and those certain equity investors party thereto (the
"Equity Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which such equity investors have
each committed, subject to (and only to) the terms and conditions thereof, to
invest the cash amounts set forth therein in the manner set forth therein, and
of which Seller is a third party beneficiary and entitled to specifically
enforce the terms thereof (the "Equity Financing") and (ii) the final and
fully executed debt commitment letter, dated the date hereof, among Buyer,
Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch and
Citizens Bank, N.A. (together with all exhibits, schedules, term sheets
and attachments thereto, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together with the
Equity Commitment Letter, the  "Financing Letters"), pursuant to which the
Debt Financing Sources party thereto have committed, subject to (and only to)
the terms and conditions thereof, to lend to Buyer the amounts set forth
therein (the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing, the
"Financing"). Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the
Financing Letters, the aggregate amounts to be provided pursuant to the
Financing Letters, together with Buyer's cash on hand and amounts available
to be drawn under Buyer's revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for
Buyer, when required by the terms of this Agreement, to (A) pay an amount in
cash equal to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and (B) pay any
and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions and the Financing. Buyer has also delivered to
Seller a true and complete copy of any final fee letter (which may be
redacted as to fee amounts, "market flex" terms and other
customary commercial terms other than any such terms that would (x) reduce
the amount of the Debt Financing or (y) impose any additional conditions or
other contingencies (or adversely amend, modify or expand any existing
conditions or other contingencies) to the obligations of the Debt Financing
Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter to fund the Debt Financing)
executed in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee letter,
as it may be redacted, a  "Fee Letter").

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(b)  As of the date hereof, (i) none of the Financing Letters or
the Fee Letters has been amended or modified, (ii) no such amendment or
modification is contemplated or in discussion by any party thereto with
respect to the Equity Commitment Letter or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters (other than, in the
case of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters, any customary
amendment or modification solely to join additional financing sources,
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, documentation agents or other
agents, managers, co-managers or similar entities as contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter), (iii) the respective commitments set forth in the
Financing Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and no
such withdrawal or rescission is contemplated or in discussion with respect to
the Equity Commitment Letter or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, with respect to
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters, and (iv) assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Article
III_ and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ at Closing, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the Financing Letters
will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the funding of the Financing
will not be made to Buyer on a timely basis in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  As of the date hereof, the Financing Letters are in full
force and effect and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of
Buyer and, with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter, the other parties
thereto and, with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters,
to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
law or equity). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing (including any flex
provisions), other than as set forth in the Financing Letters or the Fee
Letters. As of the date hereof, other than the Financing Letters or the Fee
Letters, there are no side letters or other contracts, arrangements or
understandings (written or oral) that could (i) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Financing, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing or any other terms of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (B) make the
timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtain the Financing, less likely to occur or (C) materially adversely impact
the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights and remedies against the
other parties to the applicable Financing Letter. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_,
as of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach under the Financing Letters by
Buyer or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any other party to any Financing Letter.
Buyer has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment or
other fees which are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof pursuant
to the terms of the Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter. For
purposes of this _Section 4.5(c)_ , the term Debt Financing shall not include
the incremental revolving credit facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(d)  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing
shall not be a condition to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.6   _No Broker 's or Finder's Fees_.

  



  

No agent, broker, or finder acting on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates is or will be entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any
other commission or fee in connection with the performance of its obligations
under the Transaction Agreements.

  



  

Section 4.7   _Investment Representations_.

  



  

Buyer is acquiring the Interests for Buyer's own account and not with a view
to any resale or distribution within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the
Securities Act. Buyer is (a) knowledgeable, sophisticated and experienced in
business and financial matters and fully understands the limitations on
transfer described above, (b) an "accredited investor" as such term is defined
in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and (c) capable of
bearing the economic risks of acquiring the Interests. Buyer understands that
the Interests to be acquired by Buyer hereunder have not been registered under
the Securities Act on the basis that the sale provided for in this Agreement
is exempt from the registration provisions thereof. Buyer acknowledges that
such securities may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the
registration and other provisions of applicable securities laws or
pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom.

  



  

Section 4.8   _No Other Representations and Warranties_.

  



  

Buyer acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in _Article III_ hereof or set forth in any of the other
Transaction Agreements, neither Seller nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, regarding Seller Group, the
Company, GIPOP or the Business.

  



  

Section 4.9   _FERC Regulations_.

  



  

Buyer is not subject to regulation as: (a) a "holding company" as that term
is defined in PUHCA, or (b) a "public utility,"  "electric utility,"
"electric corporation," or similar entity under the laws of any state. Buyer
is subject to regulation as a "public utility" as that term is defined in the
FPA.

Section 5.2   _No Solicitation by Seller Group; Board
Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause the other members
of Seller Group and any of its and their respective Representatives not to,
(i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), any
Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, in each case, except for this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) directly or indirectly
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (except for Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any such
Person, any nonpublic information with respect to, or afford access to
properties, books or records to any Person in connection with or for the
purpose of soliciting or knowingly encouraging or facilitating, or cooperate
in any way with any such Person with respect to, any Competing Proposal or
any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of
any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to
its shareholders) that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Competing Proposal, or (iii) grant any waiver or release under or knowingly
fail to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement in
respect of a proposed Competing Proposal, unless the Board concludes in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that a failure to take
any action described in this clause (iii) would be inconsistent with the
Board's fiduciary duties to Seller Parent's stockholders under applicable
Law. Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the other members of Seller Group
and any of its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any Person (except for Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Competing Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such Person or
its Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller
Parent acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any Representative of
Seller Group takes any action at Seller Parent's direction or with Seller
Parent's knowing encouragement that if taken by Seller Parent would be a
breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_, the taking of such action by such
Representative shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section
5.2(a)_ by Seller Parent. In furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to the
extent that any of the members of Seller Group has knowledge that
any Representative of Seller Group has taken an action that, if taken by
Seller Parent, would violate the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.2(a)_, then such member of Seller Group shall promptly instruct such
Representative to cease such action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval (but not
after), in response to the receipt of a written Competing Proposal made after
the date of this Agreement that does not result from a material breach of
this _Section 5.2(a)_ by Seller Group (or a Representative of Seller Group)
that the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then Seller Group and its
Representatives may (1) furnish information with respect to Seller Group to
the Person making such Competing Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement that contains customary provisions (including
nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions and non-solicitation provisions)
at least as favorable in the aggregate to Seller Group as the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement and which does not contain any provision that would not
allow Seller Group to comply with its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement (provided that Seller Group furnishes any nonpublic information
furnished to such Person to Buyer (to the extent such information has not
been previously furnished by Seller Group to Buyer) as promptly as practicable
after, and in any event within one Business Day after, it is provided or made
available to such Person) and (2) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such Competing Proposal, including terms of a definitive agreement
with respect thereto, and the negotiation of such terms with the Person
making such Competing Proposal (and such Person's Representatives).

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ and except for the
public disclosure of a Recommendation Change Notice, neither the Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify
in any manner adverse to Buyer, or propose publicly to withdraw, change,
qualify, withhold or modify in any manner adverse to Buyer, the approval of
this Agreement or the Board Recommendation, (ii) adopt, approve, endorse or
recommend, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Competing Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (iv) take any
formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer (except for a recommendation against
such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (any action in
the foregoing clauses (i)-(iv) being referred to as a "Adverse Recommendation
Change"). Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ and the execution of a
confidentiality agreement consistent with _Section 5.2(a)_, neither the
Board nor any committee thereof shall authorize, permit, approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or allow
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or
commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Superior Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any
time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Seller to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ if (i) an Intervening Event has occurred or (ii)
Seller Parent has received a Competing Proposal that does not result from a
material breach of _Section 5.2_ by Seller Group (or a Representative of
Seller Group) and, in each case, the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) that (x) in
the case of clause (ii), such Competing Proposal is a Superior Proposal and
(y) the failure to effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the
Seller to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ as a result
of the occurrence of such Intervening Event or in response to the receipt of
such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, would be inconsistent with the
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that, prior
to making such Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Seller to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ : (1) the Board provides prior
written notice to Buyer (a "Recommendation Change Notice") that it intends to
effect a Adverse Recommendation Change at least four Business Days prior to
taking such action, which notice shall specify the basis for such Adverse
Recommendation Change and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, include a
summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
identifies the Person making such Superior Proposal and, if applicable,
provide a copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement (it being
understood that such Recommendation Change Notice shall not in itself be
deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change and that if Buyer has committed in
writing to any changes to the terms of this Agreement and there has been any
subsequent material revision or amendment to the terms of a
Superior Proposal, a new notice to which the provisions of clauses (2) and
(3) of this _Section 5.2(c)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ except that, in
the case of such a new notice, all references to four Business Days in this
_Section 5.2(c)_ shall be deemed to be three Business Days), (2) after
giving such notice and prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change or cause the Seller to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_ , Seller negotiates (and causes its Representatives to negotiate) in
good faith with Buyer (to the extent Buyer wishes to negotiate), to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that the Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal,
and (3) at the end of the four Business Day period, prior to taking action to
effect a Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Seller to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ , the Board takes into account any
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Buyer
in writing, and determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) the Competing Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

  



  

(d) Seller shall promptly (and in any event no later than 24
hours) advise Buyer of any Competing Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of any such Competing Proposal and the identity of the Person
making any such Competing Proposal and, if applicable, provide Buyer with an
executed copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with
such Competing Proposal. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed in all
material respects on a reasonably current basis (and in any event no later
than 24 hours) of the material terms and status (including any change to the
terms thereof) of any Competing Proposal. Seller shall provide to Buyer as
promptly as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event
within 24 hours of receipt or delivery) copies of all material documentation
comprising such Competing Proposal or other documentation that is material to
understanding such Competing Proposal received by Seller or any member of
Seller Group from the Person or group making a Competing Proposal (or such
Person's Representatives) and of all material documentation provided by
Seller Group to the Person or group making a Competing Proposal (or such
Person's Representatives) that comprises any counterproposal or any other
material substantive response by Seller (to the extent such counterproposal
or substantive response is permitted under this _Section 5.2_) to the Person
or group making such Competing Proposal. Seller Parent shall not, and shall
cause Seller Group not to, enter into any confidentiality or other agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits Seller
from providing such information to Buyer.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(e)  Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit any
member of Seller Group from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Seller Parent if, in the good-faith judgment of the Board
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to so disclose would
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided, however,
that in no event under clause (i) or (ii) shall the Board make an Adverse
Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section 5.2(c)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes a
member of Seller Group's receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of
this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

  



  

(f)  For purposes of this Agreement:

  



   | (i)| "Competing Proposal" means a proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Seller Parent, (B) sale, lease, contribution or
other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint
venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Subsidiary
of Seller Parent or otherwise) of (i) the Business or (ii) any other business
or assets of Seller Group (including the Business) representing 20% or more
of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Seller Group, taken as
a whole, or (C) any combination of the foregoing; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| "Superior Proposal" means a written Competing Proposal (provided
that for purposes of this definition, the applicable percentage in the
definition of Competing Proposal shall be "50.1%" rather than "20%"), which
includes the Business, and which the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor, and taking
into account the legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of
such Competing Proposal, the identity of the Person making the proposal and
any financing required for such proposal, the ability of the Person making
such proposal to obtain such required financing and the level of certainty
with respect to such required financing and to obtaining such regulatory
approvals, and such other factors that are deemed relevant by the Board,
is more favorable to Seller Parent's stockholders than the Contemplated
Transactions (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that are committed to in writing by Buyer (including pursuant to
_Section 5.2(c)_)). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

58

 



    



  

   | (iii)| "Intervening Event" means any fact, circumstance, effect,
change, event or development that (A) is unknown to or by the Board as of the
date hereof (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which
were not known to the Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (B) becomes
known to the Board prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 5.3   _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders
Meeting_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement (and in any event, within 20 Business Days), unless the Board
has made an Adverse Recommendation Change, Seller Parent shall prepare and
cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of Seller Parent relating to the Stockholders Meeting (together
with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") in
preliminary form. Buyer shall furnish all information concerning itself and
its Affiliates to Seller Parent, and provide such other assistance, as may be
reasonably requested by Seller Parent or its outside legal counsel in
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement.

  



  

(b)  Seller Parent agrees that (i) assuming the truth, accuracy
and completeness of the information supplied to Seller Parent by Buyer for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement, the Proxy
Statement will not, at the date it is first mailed to Seller Parent's
stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and
(ii) assuming the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information
supplied to Seller by Buyer for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement, the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Buyer agrees that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by Buyer for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to Seller Parent's stockholders or at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(c)  Seller Parent shall promptly notify Buyer after the receipt
of any comments from the SEC with respect to, or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement and shall provide Buyer with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Affiliates and
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Unless, the Board has made an Adverse Recommendation
Change, Seller Parent shall:

  



   | (i)| use its reasonable best efforts (1) to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement and
(2) to have the SEC advise Seller Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| file the Proxy Statement in definitive form with the SEC and
cause such definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of
Seller Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC advises
Seller Parent that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement,
and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| include the Board Recommendation in the preliminary and
definitive Proxy Statement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless the Board has made an
Adverse Recommendation Change, prior to filing the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form with the SEC, responding to any comment from the SEC with
respect to, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the
Proxy Statement, or any amendments or supplements pursuant to _Section
5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_, or mailing the Proxy Statement in definitive
form to the stockholders of Seller Parent, Seller Parent shall (i) provide
Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) consider in good faith any of Buyer's comments thereon.

  



  

(d)  If, prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any event occurs
with respect to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by Buyer for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, that is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller Parent
of such event, and Buyer and Seller Parent shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and, as
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to Seller Parent's stockholders. Nothing in this _Section
5.3(d)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section 5.3(a)_.

  



  

(e) If prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any event occurs with
respect to Seller Group, or any change occurs with respect to
other information supplied by Seller Group for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement, that is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Seller Parent shall promptly notify Buyer
of such event, and Seller Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to Seller Parent's stockholders. Nothing in
this _Section 5.3(e)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under
_Section 5.3(a)_.

  



   

60

 



    

   



  

(f)  Unless the Board has made an Adverse Recommendation
Change, Seller Parent shall, as soon as practicable after mailing of the
definitive Proxy Statement to the shareholders of Seller Parent, duly convene
and hold the Stockholders Meeting and, subject to _Section 5.3(c)_, solicit
the Stockholder Approval.

  



  

Section 5.4   _Access to Information; Cooperation with Employees_.

  



  

(a)  Upon reasonable notice, during the Pre-Closing Period,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the other members of the Seller
Group to, give Buyer, its authorized Representatives and the Debt Financing
Sources reasonable access to its offices and its books and records, in each
case, exclusively related to the Business, as Buyer may reasonably request for
the sole purpose of preparing for the transfer of the Business to Buyer;
provided, however, that such access or furnishing of information shall be
conducted at Buyer's expense, during normal business hours, under the
supervision of Seller's personnel, in compliance with Seller's safety rules
and policies, including the Company's IT Security Policy, and in such a
manner that does not interfere with the normal operations of the Business and
Buyer, its Representatives and any Debt Financing Sources shall schedule all
such access and visits in advance through a designated officer of Seller.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement during
the Pre-Closing Period, (i) Buyer, its Representatives and any Debt Financing
Sources shall not have access to (A) personnel records of any member of
Seller Group relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories, (B) information which, in Seller's reasonable
judgment, it or any of its Affiliates is under a contractual or legal
obligation not to supply or (C) any other information which, in Seller's
opinion, is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject any member of
Seller Group or the Business to any material risk of Liability, including
pursuant to any Antitrust Laws; provided that in the case of sub-clauses (B)
and (C), Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer thereof, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek alternative means to disclose such information as nearly as possible
without adversely affecting such confidentiality obligations, attorney client
privilege or applicable Law or otherwise in a manner that addresses such
risks, (ii) no member of Seller Group shall be required to take any action
which would constitute a waiver of the attorney client or other privilege or
would compromise such Person's confidential information not related to the
Business, (iii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to,
contact any vendor, supplier or customer of the Business regarding the
business, operations, or prospects of such Business or this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of Seller Parent,
and (iv) in no event shall Buyer be permitted to conduct any sampling or
testing of environmental media (including any soil, sediment, groundwater, or
surface water) or building material without the prior written consent of
Seller Parent.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(b)  All information provided to or obtained by Buyer pursuant
to _Section 5.4(a)_ will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer and its Representatives may disclose any
information relating to the Business, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
VES or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any Debt Financing
Sources or rating agencies (in each case, without any obligation on the
part of the Debt Financing Sources or rating agencies to comply with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement) so long as, in the case of any Debt
Financing Source, such Debt Financing Source is subject to confidentiality
undertakings set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or that are at least as
restrictive as those applicable to the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter or, in the case of any rating agency, such rating agency is
subject to customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to
dissemination of such information to such rating agency.

  



  

(c)  For a period of seven years following the Closing, upon
reasonable written notice, Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
Seller or its Representatives at Seller's sole expense, reasonable access
during normal business hours, to such information, books, records, documents,
instruments, accounts and other files relating to the Business, and to Buyer's
employees and to make the same available for inspection and copying by Seller
(at its expense) during normal business hours of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
notice. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4(c)_ shall be
conducted in such manner so as not to interfere with the conduct of the
business of Buyer. This _Section 5.4(c)_ shall not apply with respect to Tax
matters, which are the subject of _Section 8.6_.

  



  

Section 5.5   _Efforts_.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and to applicable legal
requirements, each of the parties shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Contemplated Transactions, including the satisfaction of the
respective conditions set forth in _Article VI_.

  



  

Section 5.6   _[Reserved]_.

  



  

Section 5.7   _Guaranties_.

  



  

(a) Members of Seller Group have provided or secured certain
guaranties, letters of credit, performance bonds, surety bonds,
indemnities and similar obligations with respect to the Business, as set
forth on _Schedule 5.7_ (each, an  "Existing Guaranty"). On or as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof but prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the release of Seller Group, its Affiliates, and any third party issuer
of any Existing Guaranty, from each Existing Guaranty, as applicable, and
the substitution of a similar obligation of Buyer, an Affiliate of Buyer or a
third party as the guarantor, indemnitor or responsible party (each, a
"Substitute Guaranty") under each Existing Guaranty, which
Substitute Guaranties will be effective as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if any Existing Guaranty is not released prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Existing
Guaranty to be replaced by a Substitute Guaranty, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Existing Guaranty to be released, cancelled
or discharged, or otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
Liability of any member of Seller Group and any third party issuer under any
Existing Guaranty to be released as promptly as practicable after the Closing
Date, and in no event later than 30 days after the Closing Date. In the case
of Existing Guaranties in the form of letters of credit, a Substitute
Guaranty shall include the posting of cash collateral supporting such existing
letter of credit until Buyer replaces such letter of credit.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(b)  Without limiting the foregoing, if any Existing Guaranty
remains outstanding and not fully released as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall perform, pay and discharge all obligations under such Existing Guaranty
within two Business Days after receipt of notice of any such obligation until
such time as it is released (other than any payment which was due and fully
payable in all respects under an Existing Guaranty prior to the Closing Date)
and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Group, its Affiliates and
any third party issuer of any Existing Guaranty with respect to all Damages
arising out of or relating to any such Existing Guaranty, including any
failure of Buyer to perform, pay and discharge all obligations under such
Existing Guaranty, with respect to claims arising from the conduct of the
Business after Closing. No member of Seller Group shall be under any
obligation to extend or renew any Existing Guaranty that expires by its
terms, nor to agree with any beneficiary of an Existing Guaranty to any
amendment, waiver, or assignment thereof, in each case, other than in
connection with the substitution thereof with a Substitute Guaranty after the
Closing.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the Seller Group
against any Damages incurred following the Closing in connection with any
Existing Guaranty, to the extent not replaced by a Substitute Guaranty prior
to the incurrence of any Damages.

  



  

Section 5.8   _Consents_.

  



  

(a)  During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Buyer and Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all
Consents from, all Persons required pursuant to any Material Contract, to the
extent such Material Contract will be assigned to the Company pursuant to the
Restructuring or will remain a Contract of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after giving effect to the Restructuring; provided, however,
that neither Buyer nor any member of Seller Group shall have any
obligation to (i) amend or modify any Contract, (ii) pay any consideration or
give anything of value to any Person for the purpose of obtaining any such
Consent or (iii) pay any costs and expenses of any third-party resulting from
the process of obtaining such Consent. If such Consent is not obtained prior
to the Closing, then, until the earlier of such time such Consent is
obtained or 12 months after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause
any other applicable member of the Seller Group to, cooperate with Buyer in
any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller intended to (i)
provide Buyer, to the fullest extent reasonably practicable, the economic and
other claims, rights and benefits of any such Material Contract and (ii) cause
Buyer to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing
Date in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Buyer acknowledges that certain Consents and waivers with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions may be required from parties to the
Material Contracts and that such Consents and waivers may not be obtained
prior to Closing and that receipt of any such Consent shall in no event be a
condition to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Except to the
extent expressly provided in the Transaction Agreements, Seller shall not
have any liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such Consents or the termination of any such Contract as
a result of the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

Section 5.9   _Governmental Approvals_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Section
5.9_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each of Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain, or cause to be obtained, the
Consents of the Governmental Authorities set forth on _Schedule 5.9(a)_ ,
including to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or
expire at the earliest possible date after filing, (ii) respond promptly to
any requests for information, including any second request, made by any
Governmental Authority, including the FTC or the DOJ, (iii) cooperate fully
with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents, and
(iv) not take any action that would reasonably be expected to have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any such Consents. Buyer and
Seller shall, as promptly as practicable and, in no event, later than ten
Business Days after the date hereof, prepare and file (A) required
Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the DOJ
(which filing shall specifically request early termination of the waiting
period prescribed by the HSR Act) and (B) notifications, filings,
registrations, submissions or other materials required or necessary to obtain
the other Consents of Governmental Authorities set forth on _Schedule 5.9(a)_.
All filings made in connection with the foregoing sentence shall be made in
substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable Law, including
Antitrust Laws. All filing fees payable in connection with the notifications,
filings, registrations, submissions or other materials contemplated by this
_Section 5.9(a)_ shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.

  



  

(b)  Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to draft and file with
FERC no later than 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement an
application seeking FERC Approval and a petition for any necessary FERC
Waiver. The parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, diligently
take all necessary and proper actions and provide any additional information
requested by FERC and other regulatory agencies in connection with any
required approvals and waivers and shall file such additional information that
may be required by FERC in connection with the application for authorization
under FPA Section 203 and petition for any necessary waiver of
FERC's Capacity Release Regulations. All filing fees, if any, payable in
connection with the notifications, filings, registrations, submissions or
other materials contemplated by this _Section 5.9(b)_ shall be borne 50% by
Buyer and 50% by Seller.

  



  

(c) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each of
Buyer and Seller shall (i) promptly notify and furnish the other party copies
of any correspondence or communication (including, in the case of any oral
correspondence or communication, a summary thereof) between it or any of
their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, or any filing such party submits to any
Governmental Authority, (ii) consult with and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed filing and any written or oral communication or
correspondence by such party to any Governmental Authority, and (iii)
consider in good faith the views of such other party in connection with
any proposed filing and any written or oral communication or correspondence
to any Governmental Authority, in each case, to the extent relating to the
subject matter of this _Section 5.9_ or the Contemplated Transactions.
Neither Buyer nor Seller shall agree to, or permit any of its Representatives
to, participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority
in respect of any filings, investigation, inquiry or any other matter
contemplated by this _Section 5.9_ or any Contemplated Transactions unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
including Buyer's undertaking pursuant to _Section 5.5_, Buyer shall not be
required to take or cause to be taken, any of the following actions to the
extent such action or actions would reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to be adverse to Buyer, the Company or their Subsidiaries in
a magnitude that would be material to the Business, taken as a whole:

  



   | (i)| entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree,
stipulation or agreement with or required by any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, or
disposition of any or all assets, categories of assets or businesses of Buyer,
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| creating or terminating relationships, ventures, contractual
rights or obligations, of Buyer, Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| defending through litigation any claim asserted in court by any
party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing, and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| effectuating any other change or restructuring of Buyer, the
Business, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(e)  In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary including Buyer's undertaking pursuant to  _Section 5.5_, Buyer
shall not be required to take or cause to be taken, any action related to
defending through litigation any claim asserted in court by any party in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order
or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing.

  



  

(f) During the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or
the Closing, except as required by this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any
action to be taken or transaction to be entered into, that would materially
impair or materially delay Buyer's ability to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions or perform its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, none of Buyer, the Subsidiaries of Buyer or their
respective Affiliates shall acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock
or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire, any amounts of
assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or division
thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not reasonably be
expected to (i) increase the risk of not obtaining any authorizations,
Consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act, or
(ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

Section 5.10   _Restructuring_.

  



  

Seller shall cause the Seller Group to, as promptly as practicable, carry
out, prior to the Closing Date, the Restructuring in accordance with the
Restructuring Agreement. Seller shall cause the Seller Group to take all
actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Restructuring at or prior to the times
set forth therein. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably apprised with respect
to the status of all material matters and activity relating to or concerning
the status of the Restructuring and the transactions contemplated thereby and
shall consult with Buyer on a regular basis, allow Buyer the opportunity to
review and approve Business Transfer Documents (as defined in the
Restructuring Agreement), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and cooperate in good faith in connection with
Buyer's reasonable requests for information related to the Restructuring.

  



  

Section 5.11   _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters and any related
Fee Letter (including any "market flex" provisions contained in any related
Fee Letter). Buyer will not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Equity
Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would, or would
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity
Financing or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Equity Financing
or any other terms of the Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (B) make the timely
funding of the Equity Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to
obtain the Equity Financing, less likely to occur or (C) materially adversely
impact the ability of Buyer or Seller, as applicable, to enforce their rights
and remedies against the other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter. Buyer
shall promptly deliver to Seller true and complete copies of any amendment,
modification or waiver to or under the Equity Commitment Letter entered into
in accordance with this _Section 5.11_. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall not
permit any amendment, modification or supplement to be made to, or any waiver
of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any related
Fee Letter (other than (x) a waiver of any closing conditions to the funding
of the Debt Financing by the Debt Financing Sources or their agents or (y) to
add additional financing sources, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents,
documentation agents or other agents, managers, co-managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof) if such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount, except as set forth in
the "market flex" provisions of the Fee Letters) to an amount that, when
taken together with the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing then in
effect, Buyer's cash on hand and amounts available to be drawn under Buyer's
revolving credit facility, would be insufficient for Buyer to (A) pay an
amount in cash equal to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3 _and (B)
pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions and the Financing or (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or other terms of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or
delay the Closing, (B) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to
occur or (C) materially adversely impact Buyer's ability to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing (such other terms that
satisfy the foregoing requirements are referred to as "Permitted
Other Terms"); provided that Buyer shall have the right to substitute other
debt financing (or additional equity financing on the same terms as the
Equity Financing (as it may be amended, modified, supplemented or waived in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) so long as Buyer delivers
commitment letters to Seller with respect to such additional equity
financing) for all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter from the same and/or alternative financing sources;
provided further that such substitution shall not (1) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount (except as set forth in any
applicable "market flex" provisions)) to an amount that, when taken together

cash on hand and amounts available to be drawn under Buyer's revolving credit
facility, would be insufficient for Buyer to (A) pay an amount in cash equal
to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3 _and (B) pay any and all fees
and expenses required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions and the Financing or (2) impose new or additional conditions or

occur. Any reference in this Agreement to (x) "Financing", "Equity Financing"
and "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the
Financing Letters as amended, modified, supplemented, waived, replaced or
substituted in compliance with this _Section 5.11 _and (y)

conditions thereof, (ii) to negotiate and, no later than the Closing Date,
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related Fee Letter
(including the "market flex" provisions contained in any related Fee Letter)
or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to Buyer and that are
Permitted Other Terms, (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to
the funding of the Debt Financing set forth in such definitive agreements that
are applicable to Buyer and within its control in accordance with the terms
and conditions thereof, (iv) to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior
to the Closing if the conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements with
respect thereto have been satisfied, (v) to comply with its obligations under
the Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter that are within its control
in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, and (vi) upon
satisfaction of all conditions herein to Buyer's obligations to effect the
Closing and satisfaction of all conditions to the funding of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, to enforce its rights under the Financing
Letters (other than through litigation), subject to the terms and conditions
of the Financing Letters and the definitive agreements with respect thereto,
in the event of a breach or repudiation by any other party thereto that could
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the Closing
(after giving effect to the availability of any Alternate Financing, Buyer's
cash on hand and amounts available to be drawn under Buyer's revolving credit
facility). Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall give Seller prompt written notice (and in any event within three
Business Days after it becomes aware thereof) (A) of any material breach or
default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach
or default) by any party to any Financing Letters, Fee Letter or any other
definitive document related to the Financing of which Buyer becomes aware, in
each case, that could impact the funding or closing of the Financing, (B) of
the receipt by Buyer of any written notice or other communication from any
Financing source with respect to (1) any material breach or default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Letters, any Fee
Letter or any other definitive document related to the Financing of
any provisions of the Financing Letters, Fee Letter or any other definitive
document related to the Financing or (2) any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any Financing Letters, any Fee Letter or any
other definitive document related to the Financing, in each case, that could
impact the funding or closing of the Financing, and (C) if for any reason
Buyer believes in good faith that there is a reasonable possibility that it
will not be able to obtain on a timely basis all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Financing Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing in any
manner which impairs, delays or prevents the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within three Business Days of the date Seller delivers Buyer a written
request, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by
Seller of which Buyer is aware relating to any circumstance referred to in
clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(c) If the Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or if any
portion of the Debt Financing necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than as a result of
obtaining substitute debt or equity financing in accordance with _Section
5.11(a)_), Buyer shall promptly notify Seller and use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event to obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative
sources on terms and conditions no materially less favorable to Buyer and
Seller than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee
Letters, in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be, less other sources of cash
available to Buyer, on terms and conditions that would not be reasonably be
expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing or (ii) make the timely funding
of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing less likely to occur (the "Alternate Financing"), and to
obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternate
Financing (the "New Commitment Letter"), which shall replace or supplement
the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true and complete copy of which
(together with any related fee or other letter, which may be redacted as to
fee amounts, "market flex" provisions and other customary commercial
terms) shall be promptly provided to Seller. In the event any New Commitment
Letter is obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing" shall be deemed to mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as modified or supplemented pursuant to clause (B) below,
(B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be
deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter that is not superseded by a New
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Commitment Letter to
the extent then in effect, and (C) any reference in this Agreement to "Fee
Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee or other letter relating to the
Debt Commitment Letter that is not superseded by a New Commitment Letter at
the time in question and any fee or other letter relating to any New
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect.

(d)  Buyer agrees not to incur "Indebtedness" in reliance on the
"Incremental Cap" (as each such term is defined in the Existing Credit
Agreement (as such term is defined in the Debt Commitment Letter)) on or after
the date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the incurrence of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date)
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or materially
delay the Closing or (ii) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing materially less
likely to occur.

  



  

(e)  For purposes of this Section 5.11, the term Debt Financing
shall exclude the incremental revolving facility contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter.

and providing to the financing sources customary authorization and

assisting Buyer in procuring a public corporate credit rating and a public
corporate family rating in respect of the borrower under the Debt Financing

therewith, (iv) facilitating customary due diligence, (v) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents, surveys and title insurance as
reasonably requested by Buyer or its Debt Financing Sources in connection
with the Debt Financing, (vi) cooperating with Buyer's legal counsel in

Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act and the requirements of 31 C.F.R.
§1010.230, in each case, to the extent that such documentation and information
has been reasonably requested at least ten days prior to the Closing Date.
Seller Parent hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos
in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or the reputation or
goodwill of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates. All non-public or
otherwise confidential information regarding Seller Parent or its Affiliates

of the Closing (for the avoidance of doubt, it being acknowledged by Buyer
that the Seller Group is providing any authorization and representation
letters to the financing sources in connection with the Debt Financing as an
accommodation to assist Buyer, that Buyer is not relying, and will not rely,
on any such authorization and representations letters executed or delivered by
any member of the Seller Group, that the execution or delivery of any such
authorization and representation letters by a member of the Seller Group shall
not modify or expand the rights of or remedies available to Buyer hereunder,

from each of the title policies referenced in clause (i) above, dated as of a
date reasonably proximate to the Closing Date and certified to the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary, any lender, and the title company. Each of Seller
Parent and Seller agrees that any such cooperation will include
commercially reasonable efforts on the part of Seller Parent and Seller to
cause the removal or discharge of any Liens other than Permitted Liens,
delivery by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of any reasonable and
customary affidavits required by the title company, and the granting of
access to the applicable Owned Real Property by the above-referenced

_Section 7.1(f)_ or (ii) _Section 7.1(h)_ , then Seller Parent shall pay to
Buyer (or its designated Affiliates) a termination fee of $15,000,000 in cash
(the "Seller Termination Fee") as liquidated damages in connection with any
such termination, to be paid within two Business Days of the date on which
this Agreement is terminated. Such Seller Termination Fee shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollars to the applicable account
or accounts designated in writing to Seller Parent by Buyer.

  



  

(c)  (i) (x) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)_ (but only if Seller Termination Fee is not also payable
under _Section 7.3(b)_), (y) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)_, or (z) either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d),_ (ii) a Competing Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed or privately made to the Board after the date hereof, and, in the
case of any privately made proposals to the Board, not withdrawn, (x) in the
case of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(e)_,
prior to the date of such termination, or (y) in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting,
and (iii) within 12 months after the termination of this Agreement, Seller
shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or consummated a
Competing Proposal, then Seller Parent shall pay Seller Termination Fee
to Buyer (to an account designated in writing by Buyer) within two Business
Days after the date Seller consummates such transaction (provided that for
purposes of this _Section 7.3(c)(iii)_, the applicable percentage in the
definition of Competing Proposal shall be "50.1%" rather than "20%").

  



  

(d)  In the event this Agreement is terminated by either Seller
or Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ without the Stockholder Approval
having been obtained or _Section 7.1(d)_, then Seller Parent shall pay to
Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly following
delivery by Buyer to Seller of a written statement setting forth the amount of
Buyer Expenses and reasonable documentation thereof), all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions (the "Buyer Expenses"); provided
that Seller Parent shall not be obligated to pay Buyer Expenses in excess of
$3,500,000; provided further that any payment of Buyer Expenses shall not
affect Buyer's right to receive any Seller Termination Fee otherwise due under
_Section 7.3_ that becomes due and payable and all Buyer Expenses so paid
shall reduce the amount of the Seller Termination Fee.

  



  

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_  or _(d)_ , as
applicable, the party failing to pay the applicable termination fee shall also
pay any costs, fees and expenses incurred by such other party (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with a legal action
to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against
such party. Either party may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with (and subject to the limitations set forth in) _Section 10.11_
and the payment of Seller Termination Fee or Buyer Termination Fee, as
applicable, and the fees and expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_;
provided that under no circumstances shall either party be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance resulting in the
Closing and of payment of Seller Termination Fee or Buyer Termination Fee, as
applicable, or any such fees and expenses. Seller Termination Fee and Buyer
Termination Fee shall be considered liquidated damages (and not a penalty)
for any and all Damages suffered or incurred by Seller or Buyer or any other
Person, as applicable, in connection with this Agreement, any other
Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (and
the abandonment or termination thereof) or any other matter forming the basis
for such termination.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(f) Without limiting the rights of Seller under _Section
10.11_ prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1_, if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Buyer is
obligated to pay the Buyer Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(a)_, except as
otherwise contemplated by the provisos at the end of this sentence, upon
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee, Buyer, its Affiliates and any of the
Debt Financing Source Related Parties and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, including the Financing, to
Seller Group, and payment of the Buyer Termination Fee by Buyer shall be
Seller Parent's and Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for any claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable
fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements,
suffered or incurred by Seller Group or any other Person in connection with
this Agreement, the Contemplated Transactions, including the Financing (and
the termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and Seller Parent and Seller shall not have, and expressly
waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity), including against any Debt Financing Source
Related Party; provided that regardless of whether Buyer pays or is obligated
to pay the Buyer Termination Fee, nothing in this _Section 7.3(f)_ shall
release Buyer from liability for Fraud; provided further that Seller may
elect by written notice to Buyer within two Business Days of the date this
Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which Buyer is obligated to
pay the Buyer Termination Fee that Seller intends to pursue a claim against
Buyer for willful breach by Buyer of this Agreement, in which case the Buyer
Termination Fee shall not be so payable. If this Agreement is
terminated under circumstances in which Seller Parent is obligated to pay the
Seller Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_ except as
otherwise contemplated by the proviso at the end of this sentence, upon
payment of the Seller Termination Fee, Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall
have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, and payment of the Seller Termination Fee shall be Buyer's
sole and exclusive remedy for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by
Buyer, Affiliates and any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the
Contemplated Transactions (and the termination thereof) or any matter forming
the basis for such termination, and Buyer shall not have, and each expressly
waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity); provided that regardless of whether Seller
Parent pays or is obligated to pay the Seller Termination Fee, nothing in
this _Section 7.3(f)_ shall release Seller Parent or Seller from liability
for Fraud; provided further that Buyer may elect by written notice to Seller
within two Business Days of the date this Agreement is terminated under
circumstances in which Seller is obligated to pay the Seller Termination
Fee to pursue a claim against Seller for willful breach by Seller of this
Agreement, in which case the Seller Termination Fee shall not be so payable.
The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Seller Parent or
Buyer, as applicable, be required to pay the Seller Termination Fee or the
Buyer Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion.

ARTICLE VIII 
 OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

  



  

Section 8.1   _Employee and Employee Benefits Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Transfer of Business Employees_. On or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, to take all necessary
action to (i) transfer the employment of each Business Employee (other than an
Inactive Business Employee) to the Company (or a Subsidiary thereof) and (ii)
ensure that, effective as of the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have no employees other than the Business Employees. No later
than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to, make a written offer of employment or an offer to
engage as an independent contractor the individual providing service
primarily to the Business who is not employed in the U.S. by the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof (the "Foreign Service Provider"). On or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, to assign to the
Company and its Subsidiaries all restrictive covenant agreements in respect
of any Business Employees and Former Employees.

  



  

(b) _Company-Sponsored Plans_. With respect to participation by
the Business Employees in the Plans that are listed on _Schedule 8.1(b)_
 (such plans, the "Seller-Sponsored Plans"), Seller shall either (i) cause to
be established, in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries, a stand-alone
payroll and human resources information system ("HRIS") as well as stand-
alone Plans sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries (such plans, the
"Company-Sponsored Plans") that replicate the terms of the corresponding
Seller-Sponsored Plans in all material respects, as such terms are in effect
immediately prior to Closing, and cause the Business Employees (other than the
Inactive Business Employees) to become, as of the Closing Date, covered
exclusively by the Company's payroll and HRIS and participants in
the corresponding Company-Sponsored Plans, or (ii) in the event that such
stand-alone payroll, HRIS or one or more Company-Sponsored Plans are not yet
in effect as of the Closing, allow the Business Employees and any newly hired
employees hired by the Company or its Subsidiaries after the Closing, who
would otherwise be eligible under the Seller-Sponsored Plans (if employed
prior to the Closing), to remain or become, as applicable, participants in the
corresponding Seller-Sponsored Plans (and, if necessary to continue such
Seller-Sponsored Plan participation, remain or become, as applicable, covered
under the payroll and HRIS of Seller and its Affiliates) or to be provided
with the benefits offered under the Seller-Sponsored Plans during a
transition period commencing upon the Closing pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement (which shall provide that Buyer shall pay Seller for the
cost of all such benefits and payments made to, with respect to, or incurred
by the Business Employees (and any such newly hired employees) during such
transition period) and ending not later than December 31, 2020. Not later
than 30 days prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of
all Company-Sponsored Plans that shall be in effect as of the Closing, and in
respect of any Seller-Sponsored Plan for which the corresponding Company-
Sponsored Plan is not set forth on such list, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
in good faith to enter into the Transition Services Agreement with respect to
any such Seller-Sponsored Plan described in the immediately preceding
sentence prior to the Closing.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(c)   _Represented Employees_. Each Business Employee (other
than any Inactive Business Employee) who is employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing and who is represented
by a labor union as of immediately prior to the Closing shall remain employed
with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries at Closing and Buyer shall, as of
the Closing Date, recognize each applicable labor union, assume the
Collective Bargaining Agreement(s) in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date governing those Business Employees and comply with all the
obligations thereunder pursuant to the terms therein. Following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall credit Business Employees represented by a labor union for
years of service with the Company, Seller and any Seller Affiliate for all
purposes and as required by the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement
(other than for purposes of defined benefit pension plans (except for any
plan with respect to which assets and liabilities will transfer to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 8.1) and post-employment welfare plans or
arrangements).

  



  

(d)   _Non-Represented Employees_. Each Business Employee (other
than any Inactive Business Employee) who is employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing and is not represented
by a labor union as of immediately prior to the Closing (each, a "Non-
Represented Employee") shall remain employed with the Company or Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer at Closing and, upon the Closing, Buyer shall be
responsible for providing compensation (including any incentive
bonuses, commissions and/or other incentive opportunities) and employee
benefits to such Business Employees following the Closing in accordance with
this Section 8.1(d). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.1(d) shall not
create any right in any Business Employee or any other Person to any
continued employment or service with Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or alter the "at-will" nature of any such Business
Employee or other Person or create any right to any compensation or
benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever. All Business Employees (other than
any Inactive Business Employees) who as of the date immediately prior to the
Closing Date are employed and are not represented by a labor union and/or
governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall be employed by the Buyer
following the Closing Date and until (i) December 31, 2020, if the Closing
Date occurs on or prior to March 31, 2020, or (ii) the one year anniversary
of the Closing Date, if the Closing Date occurs after March 31, 2020 (or,
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), such earlier date on which such Business
Employee's employment with Buyer and its Affiliates terminates for any
reason), in each case, on terms and conditions that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the terms and conditions in place for those Business
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding for this purpose
any one-time or otherwise special or non-ordinary course incentive
compensation opportunities and any equity-based or equity related
compensation, any defined benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare
benefits).

  



  

(e) _Inactive Business Employees_. Immediately following the
date on which any Business Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is on
an approved leave of absence from which such Business Employee is entitled to
return to active employment pursuant to the applicable written employment
policies of Seller or any of its Affiliates or pursuant to applicable Law or
any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (each, an "Inactive Business
Employee") presents himself or herself to Buyer or its Affiliates for active
employment and is able to return to work, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, offer employment to such Inactive Business Employee, on
terms consistent with those applicable to Business Employees generally under
this Section 8.1, except with respect to timing, such offer shall be to
commence employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates upon such Inactive
Business Employee's return to active status (the date that employment with
the Buyer or one of its Affiliates commences, the "Employment Commencement
Date"). For each Business Employee who was an Inactive Business Employee
prior to the Employment Commencement Date, (i) the Buyer's (or
its Affiliate's) obligations hereunder shall commence on such Employment
Commencement Date and (ii) all references to  "Closing Date" or "Closing", as
applicable, in this Section 8.1, except for the reference to the  "one year
anniversary of the Closing Date" in Section 8.1(d), shall instead refer to the
Employment Commencement Date. Buyer shall be under no obligation to offer
employment to any Inactive Business Employee after the later of (A) the
end of the six (6) month period immediately following the Closing Date and
(B) the applicable period for reinstatement rights required under the terms
of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of Section 8.1(f), Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
and its Affiliates harmless from and against any Liabilities in respect of
any Inactive Business Employee in respect of the period prior to the
Employment Commencement Date.

  



  

   

79

 



    

  



  

(f)   _Employee Liabilities_. Seller shall indemnify, defend
and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless from and against any Liabilities
in respect of any current or former officer, employee, agent, director,
consultant, independent contractor or other service provider of Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than, in respect of any Liability arising after the
Closing, the Business Employees) and any Plan sponsored by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than, in respect of any Liability arising after the
Closing, any Company Plan, and any Liabilities in respect of the period prior
to the Closing explicitly assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates or an employee
benefit plan sponsored thereby pursuant to Section 8.1(i), 8.1(j), 8.1(k) or
8.1(p)). For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall retain any Liabilities for
any Business Employees or Former Employees for any event or incident covered
by any Seller-Sponsored Plans occurring prior to the Closing Date. Except as
set forth in Section 8.1(e), Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
Seller harmless from and against any Liabilities in respect of any Business
Employees or Company Plan arising after the Closing Date and any Liabilities
explicitly assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates herein.

  



  

(g) _Service Credit_. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
each Non-Represented Employee to receive service credit for purposes
of eligibility to participate and vesting, and, solely in cases of vacation
and severance benefits, benefit accruals ("Service Credit") under any
employee benefit plan, program or policy (including any vacation or paid time
off program or policy) sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates for the Business Employees following the Closing Date
(other than for purposes of defined benefit pension plans (except for any plan
with respect to which assets will transfer to Buyer pursuant to this _Section
8.1_ ) and post-employment welfare plans or arrangements), to the same extent
such service is recognized under comparable plans, programs and policies
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by a member of the Seller Group
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section 8.1(g)_ shall
require the crediting of service that would operate to duplicate any benefits
or funding of any such benefits or with respect to any plan, program or
policy of Buyer or its Affiliates that is no longer open to new
participants or under which benefits accruals by participants thereunder have
ceased.

  



  

   

80

 



    



   



  

(h)   _Terms of Coverage_. As of the Closing Date, with respect
to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which any Business
Employee and in which current spouses, former spouses, domestic partners,
covered dependents and beneficiaries of such Business Employees participate,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be
waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions (if
any) or requirement for evidence of insurability to the extent such
limitation had already been satisfied under the applicable Plan, and (ii)
recognize or cause to be recognized any expenses for purposes of satisfying
any out of pocket maximums or deductibles in plans, programs or arrangements
of Buyer for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent
recognized under a Plan.

  



  

(i)   _401(k) Plan-to-Plan Transfers_. As soon as
administratively practicable following the Closing Date, but no later
than the date that is six months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
the trustee of its defined contribution 401(k) plan to accept a direct
transfer of all amounts in any account balance and related liabilities which
any Business Employee (or current spouse, or former spouse or beneficiary of
an Business Employee) has in the 401(k) Plan, (the "401(k) Transfer").
The 401(k) Transfer shall be done in accordance with Section 414(l) of the
Code and the regulations, and the 401(k) Transfer shall be made in cash or in
cash equivalents or, with respect to outstanding loans, loan receivables.
Prior to the 401(k) Transfer, Buyer shall provide Seller Parent with
reasonable written assurance that Buyer's 401(k) plan is qualified under
Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code and its related trust is tax exempt
under Section 501(a) of the Code and Seller Parent may delay such
transfer until it receives such assurance. Seller Parent and Buyer shall each
reasonably cooperate with the other and shall provide to the other such
written documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably necessary
to effect the provisions of this _Section 8.1(i)_. Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities arising out of the failure by Seller to administer Seller's
401(k) Plan in compliance with its terms or applicable Law.

  



  

(j)  Verso Plan Plan-to-Plan Transfer.

  



  

   

81

 



    



   | (i)| Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to cause the
Appropriate Defined Benefit Plan  to assume in compliance with ERISA § 208
all Assumed Benefit Liabilities under the Verso Plan. As soon as 
administratively practicable following the Closing Date, but no later than the
date that is six months after the Closing Date  (such date, the "Plan
Liability Transfer Effective Date"), Buyer shall cause the trustee of the 
Appropriate Defined Benefit Plan to assume all benefit obligations accrued by
the Business Employees and Inactive Business  Employees (or current spouses,
or former spouses or beneficiaries of the Business Employees and Inactive
Business Employees)  and a group of other participants (or current spouses,
or former spouses or beneficiaries of such participants) under the  Verso
Plan (the "Qualified Verso Plan Transfer"), which other participants shall be
selected in accordance with _Schedule 8.1(j)_ (such participants, together
with the Business Employees and Inactive Business Employees who have accrued
benefits under the Verso Plan as of the Closing Date, collectively, the
"Qualified Verso Plan Participants"). As of the Plan Liability Transfer
Effective Date, Seller Parent shall cause to be transferred from the trust for
the Verso Plan to the trust maintained for the Appropriate Defined Benefit
Plan (i) all Liabilities with respect to benefits accrued by the Qualified
Verso Plan Participants in the Verso Plan determined as of the Closing Date
(the "Assumed Benefit Liabilities"), calculated using the Pension Liability
Assumptions, and (ii) assets related to the Assumed Benefit Liabilities
determined in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 414(l)
of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder (the
"Transfer Amount"). The Transfer Amount shall be (A) adjusted for the
earnings or losses from the Closing Date through the date that is no more
than five (5) days before the Plan Liability Transfer Effective Date based on
the performance of the asset identified in Annex III during such period,
provided that if Buyer's actuary and Seller's actuary agree that
such adjustment would cause an amount of assets to be transferred to the
Appropriate Defined Benefit Plan that exceeds the applicable requirements of
Section 414(l) of the Code, then within five days following the Plan Liability
Transfer Effective Date, Seller shall pay Buyer an amount in cash equal to
the shortfall and (B) reduced by the amount of any benefit payments paid
from the trust for the Verso Plan to Qualified Verso Plan Participants during
the period commencing on the Closing Date through the Plan Liability Transfer
Effective Date. The transfer of the Transfer Amount from the trust for the
Verso Plan to the trust maintained for the Appropriate Defined Benefit Plan
shall consist of an amount in cash equal to the Transfer Amount adjusted in
accordance with Section 8.1(j)(i)(A) and (B). Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 8.1(j)_ to the contrary, following the Closing Date and until
the Plan Liability Transfer Effective Date, the Seller shall cause the trust
under the Verso Plan to continue to make benefit payments to the Qualified
Verso Plan Participants as they come due under the terms of the Verso Plan, if
any, to the extent that such benefits have accrued on or before the Closing
Date. 
---|---|--- 
  

  



   | (ii)| For purposes of this _Section 8.1(j)_ , the "Appropriate Defined
Benefit  Plan" shall mean the defined benefit plan sponsored by Buyer or one
of its Affiliates that is qualified under  Section 401(a) of the Code and
whose related trust is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. Prior to
the Qualified  Verso Plan Transfer, Buyer shall provide Seller Parent with
reasonable written assurance that the Appropriate Defined Benefit  Plan is
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and its related trust is tax
exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code and Seller Parent may delay such
transfer until it receives such assurance. Seller Parent and Buyer shall each
reasonably cooperate with the other and shall provide to the other such
written documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably necessary
to effect the provisions of this _Section 8.1(j)_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

82

 



    

  



   | (iii)| The amount of the Assumed Benefit Liabilities shall be
determined as of the Closing Date using the Pension Liability Assumptions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the amount of such Assumed Benefit Liabilities
less the Transfer Amount, determined as of the Closing Date and excluding any
adjustments under _Section 8.1(j)(i)_ (A) and (B) (the  "Net Pension
Liability"), shall be as close as reasonably feasible to the Assumed Unfunded
Pension Amount, shall not be less than the Assumed Unfunded Pension Amount
and shall not exceed the Assumed Unfunded Pension Amount by more than
$2,500,000.00. The Appropriate Defined Benefit Plan shall assume the Assumed
Benefit Liabilities (as reduced in accordance with clause (B) of  _Section
8.1(j)(ii)_ ) on the Plan Liability Transfer Effective Date, but with effect
from the Closing Date, and subject to receipt of the Transfer Amount. If the
Net Pension Liability is greater than the Assumed Unfunded Pension Amount,
within five days following the Plan Liability Transfer Effective Date, Seller
shall pay Buyer an amount in cash equal to the Net Pension Liability minus
the Assumed Unfunded Pension Amount, which amount in cash shall be adjusted to
reflect an assumed rate of investment earnings (or losses) for the period
commencing on the Closing Date through the Plan Liability Transfer Effective
Date based on the performance of the asset identified in Annex III. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| As soon as practicable, but not more than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Seller Parent shall  provide Buyer with a detailed summary of
the calculations and any back-up data reasonably requested by Buyer in respect
of  the Assumed Benefit Liabilities and Transfer Amount, as set forth in
_Section 8.1(j)(ii)_. If Buyer or Buyer's  actuary does not notify Seller
Parent to the contrary within 60 days after the delivery to Buyer of such
detailed summary and  data, the calculations of the enrolled actuary for the
Verso Plan pursuant to this _Section 8.1(j)_ shall be deemed to  be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. If, however, Buyer notifies Seller
Parent in writing within such period that  there is a good faith dispute
between the calculations of the enrolled actuary for the Verso Plan and
Buyer's actuary  as to the calculation of the Assumed Benefit Liabilities or
the Transfer Amount, then the parties shall then attempt to  resolve their
differences with respect thereto. If the parties are unable to resolve their
dispute within 60 days after the  date Buyer notifies the Seller Parent of
any objections to the calculations of the enrolled actuary for the Verso Plan,
then  any unresolved objections shall be resolved conclusively and bindingly
for the parties through a determination made by the  Neutral Actuary Firm
(acting solely as an expert and not as an arbitrator). The Neutral Actuary
Firm shall be instructed to  make a determination with respect to such
unresolved objections. The parties shall provide the Neutral Actuary Firm
with  all necessary documents as requested by it as soon as possible and
shall instruct the Neutral Actuary Firm to render its  decision in accordance
with the terms set forth in this _Section 8.1(j)_ and as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The  Neutral Actuary Firm shall be instructed to
grant the parties the opportunity to state their points of view and, if the 
Neutral Actuary Firm determines that a hearing would be appropriate, the
Neutral Actuary Firm may conduct a hearing on the  unresolved objections
submitted to the Neutral Actuary Firm. All submissions by Seller Parent or the
Buyer to the Neutral  Actuary Firm shall be in writing and shall
simultaneously be delivered to the other party and there shall be no ex
parte  communication with the Neutral Actuary Firm. The Neutral Actuary Firm
shall be instructed to submit its decision and its  reasoning in writing to
the parties. Absent fraud, intentional misconduct or manifest error, the
resolution by the Neutral  Actuary Firm of the unresolved objections referred
to the Neutral Actuary Firm shall be final and binding upon the parties.  The
fees and disbursements of the Neutral Actuary Firm shall be allocated between
the Seller Parent and the Buyer in the same  proportion that the aggregate
amount of unresolved objections so submitted to the Neutral Actuary Firm are
unsuccessfully  disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Neutral Actuary Firm) bears to the total amount of the unresolved  objections
so submitted, as determined by the Neutral Actuary Firm in its final
determination. Notwithstanding any of the  foregoing provisions relating to a
dispute, in the event that the aggregate amount in controversy is less than
$50,000 and  remains unresolved on the last day of the 60-day period
following the date Buyer notifies Seller Parent of any objections  to the
calculations of the enrolled actuary for the Verso Plan, the dispute shall not
be submitted to the Neutral Actuary  Firm and, instead, the parties shall be
deemed to have agreed to settle the dispute for an amount equal to one-half of
the  amount in controversy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities arising out of the failure
by Seller to administer the Verso Plan in compliance with its terms or
applicable Law if such failure occurred prior to the Plan Liability Transfer
Effective Date. 
---|---|---

(k) _FSA Spin-Off_. Effective as of the Closing Date (or, if
later, the date that participation by Business Employees in the Seller-
Sponsored Plan that is a FSA Plan in accordance with _Section 8.1(b)_
terminates (the later of such dates, the "FSA Transfer Date")), any Business
Employee (or current spouse, or former spouse, domestic partner, covered
dependent or beneficiary of a Business Employee) shall cease to participate in
any Seller-Sponsored Plan that is a health care and/or dependent care
flexible spending account (a "FSA"). With respect to any Business Employee
(or current spouse, or former spouse or beneficiary of a Business Employee)
who immediately prior to the FSA Transfer Date was a participant in any
Seller-Sponsored Plan that is a health care or dependent care flexible
spending account plan (a "FSA Plan") (and, if applicable pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)_ , any other employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries hired
after the Closing Date who is a participant in any Seller-Sponsored Plan that
is an FSA Plan (all such participants, the "FSA Participants")), Buyer shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, accept a spin-off of such FSA Participant's
FSA (if any) (or of a current spouse, or former spouse, domestic partner,
covered dependent or beneficiary of a FSA Participant) for the calendar year
in which the FSA Transfer Date occurs to the Company-Sponsored Plan that is a
FSA Plan or any other FSA Plan designated by Buyer, and Buyer shall honor
and continue through the end of the calendar year in which the FSA Transfer
Date occurs the election of the FSA Participant's FSA (if any) (or of a
current spouse, or former spouse, domestic partner, covered dependent
or beneficiary of a FSA Participant) in effect under the applicable Seller-
Sponsored Plan that is a FSA Plan immediately prior to the FSA Transfer Date.
On and after the FSA Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume obligations to
administer and pay, under the Company-Sponsored Plan that is a FSA Plan or
any other applicable plans of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, all eligible
reimbursement claims of any FSA Participant (or current spouse, or former
spouse, domestic partner, covered dependent or beneficiary of a FSA
Participant) incurred, but not paid, in the calendar year in which the FSA
Transfer Date occurs that are eligible for reimbursement and are submitted
for payment on or after the FSA Transfer Date, whether such claims arose
before, on or after the FSA Transfer Date, other than any claims arising out
of the failure by Seller or its Affiliates to administer the FSA Plan in
compliance with its terms or applicable Law. As soon as practicable following
the FSA Transfer Date, Seller or its Subsidiaries shall cause to be
transferred to Buyer an amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of all
contributions to each applicable FSA made with respect to the calendar year in
which the FSA Transfer Date occurs by any FSA Participant (or current spouse,
or former spouse, domestic partner, covered dependent or beneficiary of such
FSA Participant), reduced by (ii) the sum of all reimbursement payouts for
claims paid to such FSA Participant (or current spouse, or former spouse,
domestic partner, covered dependent or beneficiary of such FSA Participant)
under the Seller-Sponsored Plan that is a FSA Plan in the calendar year in
which the FSA Transfer Date occurs that were paid prior to the FSA Transfer
Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Section 8.1(k)_ to the contrary,
from and after the Closing, the Seller-Sponsored Plan that is a FSA Plan
shall retain and be solely liable for the FSA of each FSA Participant in
respect of the calendar year ending immediately prior to the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs, and in the event that there is a period of time
remaining under the terms of such Seller-Sponsored Plan that is an FSA Plan
for such FSA Participant to submit claims and the FSA Participant has a
remaining balance thereunder, Seller shall cause the applicable Seller-
Sponsored Plan to make reimbursement payouts thereunder as though the Closing
had not occurred.

  



  

(l) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent any claims for benefits under any Plan that is a
health plan are incurred with respect to any Business Employee (or current
spouse, or former spouse, domestic partner, covered dependent or beneficiary
of an Business Employee) for services rendered prior to the Closing Date, such
claims shall remain a Liability of the applicable Plan of Seller Parent or
its Affiliates, and any claims under any Plan that is a life insurance plan
or disability plan with respect to any Business Employee (or current spouse,
or former spouse, domestic partner, covered dependent or beneficiary of an
Business Employee) arising out of events occurring prior to the Closing Date
shall remain a Liability of the applicable Plan of Seller Parent or its
Affiliate.

(m)   _Workers ' Compensation_. Seller and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for all claims for workers' compensation benefits which are
incurred on or prior to the Closing Date by Business Employees and covered
under Seller's worker compensation policies. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
be responsible for all claims for workers' compensation claims that are
incurred after the Closing Date by Business Employees and covered under
Buyer's workers compensation policies. For purposes of this  _Section 8.1(m)_
, a claim for workers' compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred
when the event giving rise to the claim occurs; provided that responsibility
for a workers' compensation claim that arises from a repetitive activity that
occurs over a period both preceding and following the Closing Date shall be
apportioned pursuant to applicable workers' compensation law and in
accordance with applicable workers' compensation insurance policies held by
each party.

  



  

(n)   _COBRA Benefits_. With respect to each Plan that is a
"group health plan," (as defined under Section 4980B of the Code and the
regulations thereunder ("COBRA")), effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be responsible for all obligations to provide or offer COBRA
continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA to any Business Employee who is
actively employed as of immediately prior to the Closing and for the current
or former spouse, domestic partner, or covered dependent or beneficiary of
any such Business Employee. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
all obligations to provide or offer COBRA continuation coverage pursuant to
COBRA to any Former Employee and for the current or former spouse, domestic
partner, or covered dependent or beneficiary of a Former Employee and to any
other Business Employee who is not actively employed as of immediately prior
to the Closing.

  



  

(o)   _WARN Act_. Any Liability under the WARN Act with regard
to any Business Employee that arises following the Closing shall be the sole
responsibility of Buyer and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and
its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all such resulting
Liabilities under the WARN Act. Further, Seller and its Affiliates shall
provide any required notice under, and shall retain all Liabilities relating
to the WARN Act with respect to any triggering event under the WARN
Act affecting Former Employees.

  



  

(p) _Treatment of Annual Bonuses_. Seller and its Affiliates
shall retain all Liability for any cash incentive compensation payable
under each annual compensation plan or arrangement in which any Business
Employee participates in respect of fiscal year 2019. Buyer shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, assume all Liability for any cash incentive
compensation payable under each incentive compensation plan or arrangement in
which any Business Employee who is employed as of immediately prior to
the Closing participates in respect of the fiscal year 2020 to any such
Business Employee in connection with their services to the Business (the
"2020 Cash Incentive Compensation"). All 2020 Cash Incentive Compensation
shall be governed by plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) on terms and
conditions no less favorable than those that applied to each such Business
Employee prior to the Closing Date, including with respect to target
incentive opportunities and applicable performance metrics. Seller
shall consult with Buyer in good faith regarding the terms and conditions of
any 2020 Cash Incentive Compensation prior to adopting the applicable plans,
programs or arrangements.

(q)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee, independent
contractor, any beneficiary, or any other Person any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish or be treated
as an amendment or modification of any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement, arrangement, policy or scheme (ii) shall alter or limit Buyer's,
the Company's, any member of the Seller Group's or their Affiliates' ability
to amend, modify or interpret or terminate any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement, arrangement, policy or scheme at any time in accordance with the
terms thereof and applicable Law or (iii) give any third party, including
any Business Employee, any right to rely upon or demand or enforce the
provisions of this _Section 8.1_.

applicable Law, Buyer and Seller agree that for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date, they will follow the Alternate Procedure of Rev.
Proc. 2004-53, 2004-34 IRB 320, so that Buyer shall be responsible for
employment Tax reporting with respect to Business Employees for that calendar
year; provided that Seller provides Buyer with all employment Tax information
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyer's preparation and
filing of employment Tax Returns for the Business Employees for that year.

  



  

(s)   _Seller Parent Equity Awards_. Seller Parent and its
Affiliates shall take all actions necessary such that, as of

Section 8.2   _Non-Solicitation_.

  



  

(a)  For 12 months following the Closing Date, Seller Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly
(except on behalf of and for the benefit of Buyer) solicit or offer employment

shall prohibit Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates from employing any such
employee as a result of a general solicitation to the public or general
advertising or the solicitation of any Business Employee whose
employment with Buyer has terminated at least six months prior to the date of

86

 



    



  

Section 8.3   _Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of two years after the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Seller Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (it being acknowledged and agreed that, solely for the purposes of
this _Section 8.3_ , the term "Affiliates" shall not include any stockholder
of Seller Parent), that neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly (i) engage in, or (ii) own, operate or assist
any Person or business which engages in the business of designing,
manufacturing and selling any specialty paper products related to (a) coated
thermal transfer papers manufactured and sold at the Stevens Point Mill, (b)
coated direct thermal base papers, manufactured and sold at the Stevens
Point Mill or (c) uncoated flexible packaging manufactured and sold at the
Androscoggin Mill (any such business, a "Competitive Business").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit Seller Parent or
any of its Affiliates, at any time, from:

  



   | (i)| being a passive owner of no more than 5% of the outstanding
shares of any class of securities of a Person that, directly or indirectly,
engages in a Competitive Business, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| performing any services for Buyer or any of its Affiliates, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| acquiring (whether by equity purchase, asset purchase, merger,
consolidation or otherwise) and, after such acquisition, owning an interest
in any business or Person (or its successor) that is engaged in a Competitive
Business, provided, that, (A) such Competitive Business represented less than
10% of such business' or Person's assets in the last completed fiscal year of
such Person prior to the consummation of the applicable acquisition or (B)
Seller Parent or its Affiliate, as applicable, uses commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the acquired business or Person (or its successor) to, within
one year after such acquisition is consummated, enter into a definitive
agreement with a Third Party Buyer (as defined below) to divest itself of the
Competitive Business or a portion thereof such that such acquisition would
satisfy the requirements set forth in sub-clause (A) of this clause (iii), or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| carrying out its obligations pursuant to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event that any bona fide third party Person or Persons acquire (whether by
equity purchase, asset purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) (such
Person or Persons, a "Third Party Buyer"), directly or indirectly, any or all
of the assets or business of the Seller Group as of the
Closing (collectively, the "Restricted Assets"), nothing herein shall
restrict such Third Party Buyer or its Affiliates from engaging in, owning or
operating any Person or business that engages in any of the businesses or
activities in which such third party and its Affiliates are engaged as of
immediately prior to such acquisition or may be engaged in the future;
provided that in no event shall any such third party or an Affiliate thereof
engage in, own or operate any Competitive Business through use of the
Restricted Assets for the remainder of the Restricted Period.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(c)  If, at the time of enforcement of this _Section 8.3_ , a
court or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall hold
that the subject matter, duration, scope, geographic area or other
restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then
existing, the maximum subject matter, duration, scope, geographic area or
other restrictions deemed reasonable under such circumstances by such court
shall be substituted for the stated subject matter, duration, scope,
geographic area or other restrictions.

  



  

(d)  Seller Parent acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
restrictions contained in this _Section 8.3_ are reasonable in all respects
(including with respect to the subject matter, duration, scope and geographic
area) and are necessary to protect the value of the Company (including the
goodwill related thereto) and (ii) Buyer would not have agreed to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby without the restrictions contained in
this _Section 8.3_.

  



  

(e)  Seller Parent recognizes and affirms that in the event of
breach by it of any of the provisions of this _Section 8.3_ , money damages
would be inadequate and Buyer would have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and
remedies existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and Seller Parent's
obligations under this  _Section 8.3_ not only by a claim for damages, but
also by a claim for specific performance, injunctive or other
equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the
provisions of this _Section 8.3_.

  



  

(f)  For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.3 shall
prohibit Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, at any time, from
manufacturing and selling any products that are currently manufactured and
sold by Seller Parent and its Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement at
any facility other than the Stevens Point Mill and the Androscoggin Mill.

  



  

Section 8.4   _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a)  The confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference as if set forth
herein and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, unless
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, in which case the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

(b) From and after the Closing until the date that is two years
after the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Representatives to, keep confidential any and all non-public information
relating to the Business; provided, however, that Seller Parent shall not be
liable hereunder with respect to any disclosure to the extent such disclosure
is determined by Seller Parent (with the advice of counsel) to be required by
any applicable Law or Governmental Order, including applicable rules of any
securities exchange. In the event that a member of Seller Group or its
Representatives are required by any applicable Law or Governmental Order to
disclose any such non-public information, Seller Parent shall, (i) to the
extent permissible by such applicable Law or Governmental Order, provide Buyer
with prompt notice of such requirement, (ii) disclose only that information
that Seller Parent determines (with the advice of counsel) is required by
such applicable Law or Governmental Order to be disclosed, and (iii) use
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such non-public
information, including by, at Buyer's request, reasonably cooperating with
Buyer to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public information (at
Buyer's sole cost and expense). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such non-public
information shall not include information that (A) is or becomes available to
the public after the Closing other than as a result of a disclosure by a
member of Seller Group or its Representatives in breach of this _Section
8.4(b)_, (B) becomes available to a member of Seller Group or its
Representatives after the Closing from a source other than Buyer or its
Affiliates or its Representatives if the source of such information is not
known by a member of Seller Group or its Representatives to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to, Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to
such information, or (C) is independently developed by a member of Seller
Group or its Representatives without breach of this _Section 8.4(b)_.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Closing until the date that is two years
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, keep confidential any and all non-public information
relating to a member of Seller Group, including any information that was
furnished to Buyer and its Affiliates or Representatives by a member of Seller
Group or its Representatives in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be liable hereunder
with respect to any disclosure to the extent such disclosure is determined to
be required by Buyer (with the advice of counsel) by any applicable Law or
Governmental Order, including applicable rules of any securities exchange. In
the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives are required
by any applicable Law or Governmental Order to disclose any such non-public
information, Buyer shall, (i) to the extent permissible by such applicable
Law or Governmental Order, provide Seller Parent with prompt written notice
of such requirement, (ii) disclose only that information that Buyer determines
(with the advice of counsel) is required by such applicable Law or
Governmental Order to be disclosed, and (iii) use reasonable efforts to
preserve the confidentiality of such non-public information, including by, at
Seller Parent's request, reasonably cooperating with Seller Parent to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public information (at
Seller Parent's sole cost and expense). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
non-public information shall not include information that (A) is or becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Buyer or its
Affiliates or Representatives in breach of this _Section 8.4(c)_ or (B)
becomes available to Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives from a source
other than a member of Seller Group or its Representatives if the source of
such information is not known by Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives
to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal
or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, a member of Seller Group with
respect to such information, or (C) is independently developed by Buyer or
its Affiliates or Representatives without breach of this _Section 8.4(c)_.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

Section 8.5   _Publicity_.

  



  

Except with respect to (a) an Adverse Recommendation Change, a Superior
Proposal or any matter related to any of the foregoing, (b) any dispute
between or among the parties regarding this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, and (c) a press release or other public statement that is
consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by a party in accordance with this
Agreement, including in investor conference calls, filings with the SEC, QandAs
or other publicly disclosed documents, in each case under this clause (c), to
the extent such disclosure is still accurate, Buyer and Seller Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
written public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
written public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party
reasonably concludes (based upon advice of its outside legal counsel) may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to the
rules of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation
system. Buyer and Seller Parent agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall
be in a form agreed to by the parties.

  



  

Section 8.6   _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Mutual Cooperation_. Seller Parent and Buyer shall,
solely with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Business, (i)
each provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by
either of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or the
defense or administration of any Tax Contest, (ii) each retain and provide the
other upon reasonable request any records (or portions thereof) that may be
relevant to any Tax Return or Tax Contest; provided that (x) with respect to
any Consolidated Group Tax Return, provision of solely the portions relevant
to the Business is sufficient to meet this obligation, (y) the exceptions
provided in _Sections 5.4(a)(i)(B)_ and (C) (including the proviso with
respect thereto) are incorporated herein by reference, _mutatis mutandis_ and
(z) neither party shall be required to provide the portions of any records
or other documentation pertaining to assets other than the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Business, and (iii) each provide the other with any
final determination of any such Tax Contest if the other party is responsible
for any Liability that arises therefrom. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer and Seller Parent shall retain, until the applicable
statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have expired, copies of
all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and other records or
information that may be relevant to such Tax Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods.

  



  

(b)   _Transaction Taxes_. Seller Parent and Buyer shall each
bear 50% of any Transaction Taxes arising from or with respect to the sale
and purchase of the Interests, and Seller shall bear 100% of any other
Transaction Taxes. Buyer and Seller Parent agree to reasonably cooperate with
each other to timely complete and file (i) all Tax Returns for Transaction
Taxes, and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
exemption certificates or other documents that may reduce or eliminate any
Transaction Taxes.

  



  

(c)   _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any Straddle Tax
Period, Taxes shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
Post-Closing Tax Period in the case of (i) real property Taxes, personal
property Taxes, or ad valorem obligations and similar recurring Taxes, on a
daily pro rata basis and (ii) Taxes other than the Taxes described in clause
(i), as if such period ended on the Closing Date.

  



  

   

90

 



    



  

(d)   _Tax Returns_. Seller Parent shall prepare and timely file
(or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or relating directly to the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (other than a Straddle Tax Period) and, to the extent due on or prior
to the Closing Date, any Straddle Tax Period. Buyer shall prepare and timely
file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all other Tax Returns, other
than Seller Parent's Consolidated Group Tax Returns, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating directly to the Business with respect to any Straddle
Tax Period. If Seller Parent or Buyer is required to (i) file any Tax Return
to be prepared by the other party or (ii) bear the economic burden of any
portion of the Tax payable in connection with any Tax Return to be prepared
by the other party, the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return (the
"Preparer") shall deliver to the other party (the "Reviewer") a copy of
such Tax Return and any supporting work schedules, work papers and other
documentation relevant to the Reviewer's review of such Tax Return not later
than 45 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (including applicable
extensions) (the "Due Date"). The Preparer shall not file such Tax Return
until the earlier of (i) the receipt of written notice from the Reviewer
indicating the Reviewer's consent thereto, or (ii) one day prior to the Due
Date, and shall incorporate all reasonable comments of the Reviewer. If the
Reviewer is required to file such Tax Return, the parties will discuss in good
faith any reasonable comments of the Reviewer and revise the Tax Return
accordingly prior to the filing of such Tax Return.

  



  

(e)   _Refunds and Credits_. If one party receives a refund (or
credit) of Taxes that were allocable to, payable by, and actually paid or
reimbursed by the other party (which refund or credit shall be allocable
between the parties based on the same methodology used to allocate the
original taxes refunded or credited), such party shall promptly pay such
refund or credit over to the other party.

  



  

(f)   _Tax Contests_.

  



   | (i)| If, following the Closing Date, Buyer receives written notice of
any Tax Contest relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or in respect of which Seller Parent may have any
Liability, including pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly provide
a copy of such notice to Seller Parent. Except with respect to any Tax
Contest dealing with a Straddle Tax Period or any Consolidated Group Tax
Return of Buyer or its Affiliates, Seller Parent shall have the right, but
not the obligation, at Seller Parent's expense, to control, manage and be
responsible for, and to contest or settle, any such Tax Contest in connection
with such notice. Buyer may participate in such Tax Contest at its
own expense. Seller Parent shall keep Buyer informed of the progress of all
such Tax Contests and provide copies of all written communications with any
Taxing Authority related to such Tax Contests. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| If, following the Closing Date, Seller Parent receives written
notice of any Tax Contest relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Seller Parent shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to Buyer. If such
Tax Contest relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (not a Straddle
Period), then Seller Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, at
Seller Parent's expense, to control, manage and be responsible for, and to
contest or settle, any such Tax Contest in connection with such notice. Buyer
may participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense. Seller Parent shall
keep Buyer informed of the progress of all such Tax Contests and provide
copies of all written communications with any Taxing Authority related to
such Tax Contests. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

  

   

91

 



    



   | (iii)| Buyer shall have the right to control, manage and be
responsible for, and to contest or settle (in its sole discretion) all other
Tax Contests relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries. If such Tax Contest
is with respect to a Straddle Tax Period, Seller Parent may participate at
its own expense; provided that Buyer may not settle any claims with respect
to a Straddle Tax Period without Seller Parent's prior written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(g)   _GIPOP Elections_. If requested in writing by Buyer prior
to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause GIPOP to (i) make a valid election under Section 754 of the Code for
the taxable period that includes the Closing Date, and (ii) use the interim
closing of the books method under Section 706 of the Code in respect of the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

Section 8.7   _Payments_.

  



  

If following the Closing, a member of Seller Group receives payment on behalf
of one of the Business that constitutes an asset of the Business (after
giving effect to the Restructuring), such payment shall be the property of,
and Seller Parent and Seller shall cause the applicable member of the Seller
Group to forward and remit to Buyer, as promptly as practicable, but no later
than ninety days, after receipt thereof. In the event that Buyer or the
Company receives any payments on behalf of any business of a member of Seller
Group or Affiliates (other than the Business) after the Closing, such
payments shall be the property of, and shall be forwarded and remitted to
such member of Seller Group or Affiliate as promptly as practicable, but no
later than ninety days, after receipt thereof.

  



  

Section 8.8   _Use of Names and Logos_.

  



  

(a) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall not assist others to, in any way adopt, use, seek to
use, apply to register or register the Retained Marks, or any confusingly
similar Trademark, on or in connection with any product, service, corporate
name, Trademark, trade name, domain name, service mark or service name. On and
after the Closing Date, Buyer further shall not, directly or indirectly,
challenge, and shall not assist any other party in challenging, by
cancellation, opposition or otherwise, the validity of the Retained Marks or
any current or future applications for registration or registrations thereof,
or Seller Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' ownership thereof or title
thereto, except in the event Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries first
initiates any action, lawsuit or other claim against Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as provided in _Section 8.8(b)_, in no event
shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates, use any such Retained Mark on or after
the Closing in any way, including in any manner likely to cause confusion, or
to cause mistake or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or
association of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, or as to the origin,
sponsorship, or approval of such products or services. Within 60 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, submit all necessary and appropriate requests with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and all other applicable
Governmental Authorities to amend the company name of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries to remove "Verso" from its company name.

  



  

   

92

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of one hundred
180 days commencing on the Closing Date, Seller Parent hereby grants to Buyer
and Buyer hereby accepts, a limited and non-exclusive right and license (which
right and license shall not be sublicensable or transferable or assignable,
including by change of control or operation of law) to use the Retained Marks
solely in connection with the operation of the Business (and subject at all
times to Seller Parent's right to exercise quality control with respect to
the use of the Retained Marks and the goodwill associated therewith) solely
for the purpose of exhausting the inventory of printed purchase orders, sales
invoices, marketing materials, stationery, printed forms, other documents and
office and shipping supplies, and other products, equipment, items and
web/Internet pages bearing the Retained Marks as of the Closing Date on a
royalty-free basis, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Buyer's use of the Retained Marks during this 180 day phase-out license
period shall be strictly conform to the manner in which such marks were used
by Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing and all use of such
marks shall be, at all time, subject to Seller Parent's direction and control.
Buyer shall correct any use that materially deviates from the written quality
standards provided to Buyer prior to the Closing. Upon the termination of the
one hundred 180 days license period, Buyer shall terminate all use of the
Retained Marks, including from all signage, web/Internet use, and other
business materials and documents, and certify the same in writing. Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to destroy any remaining items which bear
the Retained Marks upon the termination of the foregoing license.

  



  

Section 8.9   _Know-How Documentation_.

  



  

The parties agree that the documentation in which any Know-How of the
Business is embodied is already available to Buyer and a separate handover of
such documentation is therefore not necessary. To the extent that Seller
Parent or its applicable Subsidiary, including but not limited due to
statutory safekeeping periods or contractual obligations, is not authorized to
transfer such documentation, such transfer will not take place together with
the transfer of the Business. In such a case Seller Parent will, as far as
legally possible, grant to Buyer the necessary access to such documents at
any time within the statutory safekeeping periods. As far as is
legally permissible, Buyer may have copies of such documents made at its own
cost.

  



  

Section 8.10   _Certain Proprietary Information of Seller_.

  



  

Prior to the Closing Date, the Business was routinely supplied copies of
proprietary and confidential information relating to strategic, technical, or
marketing plans of Seller Parent and its Affiliates and their various
operations unrelated to the Business (collectively, "Seller Information").
Although Seller Parent has attempted to recover such Seller Information
related to the Business, some of this confidential information may still be
present within the Company. Buyer therefore agrees that it will not use or
disclose Seller Information that is specifically identified as such for any
purpose whatsoever, and shall destroy any remaining copies of such
specifically identified Seller Information in its possession after Closing.

Section 8.11   _Further Assurances_.

  



  

Following the Closing, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer, Seller Parent and Seller shall execute and deliver, or
cause other members of the Seller Group to execute and deliver, such
additional documents, instruments and assurances and take such other actions
as may reasonably be requested to carry out and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions. Members of the Seller Group agree, for the benefit of Buyer,
that the Business Transfer Documents referred to in the Restructuring
Agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer and that Buyer shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review the same prior to the Closing Date.

Section 9.1   _Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Covenants_.

  



  

(a)  All of the representations and warranties (other than the
Buyer Fundamental Representations, the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.16_ and the Seller Fundamental Representations) of the
parties set forth in this Agreement shall terminate and expire, and shall
cease to be of any force or effect, upon the Closing Date. The Buyer
Fundamental Representations and the Seller Fundamental Representations and
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.16_ shall
survive until 60 days after the applicable statute of limitations has run
(taking into account any extensions or waivers thereof), and all Liability
and indemnification obligations with respect to any such representations and
warranties shall thereupon be extinguished (except to the extent a claim for
indemnification has been made in writing prior to such time for any breach
thereof). All covenants and agreements set forth herein which by their terms
are to be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions,
subsequent to the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing for the period
expressly specified therein. All covenants and agreements contained herein
which by their terms are to be performed in whole on or prior to the Closing
Date shall survive the Closing for 12 months.

  



  

(b)  As used in this _Article IX_, any reference to a
representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Section of this
Agreement shall include the appropriate Disclosure Schedule, relating to such
Section.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
_Article IX_, and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.4_,
from and after the Closing, Seller Parent hereby agrees to hold harmless and
indemnify Buyer, its equityholders, directors, officers, Affiliates,
employees, successors and permitted assigns (hereinafter
individually referred to as a "Buyer Indemnified Party") from and against,
without duplication, any and all losses, Liabilities, damages, demands,
claims, suits, actions, causes of action, judgments, assessments, Taxes, costs
and expenses, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or
litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (collectively, "Damages") incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party, as
a result of or arising from: (i) a breach of any Seller Fundamental
Representation or other representation or warranty made by Seller Parent in
_Section 3.16_, (ii) a breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement
made by any member of Seller Group in this Agreement or the Restructuring
Agreement (or the Business Transfer Documents referred to therein), (iii)
without duplication, any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, any Transaction Taxes allocable to Seller Parent
under _Section 8.6(b)_ and any Consolidated Return Taxes, (iv) Retained
Liabilities, and (v) any claim that Buyer's use of the Retained Marks
pursuant to _Section 8.8(b)_ infringes a Trademark owned by any third party
(clauses (i) through (v) collectively,  "Buyer Indemnifiable Claims").

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

(b)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
_Article IX_, and subject to the limitation set forth in  _Section 9.4_,
from and after the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify
Seller, its shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, employees,
successors and permitted assigns (hereinafter individually referred to as a
"Seller Indemnified Party"), from and against, without duplication, any and
all Damages incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party as a result of or
arising from: (i) a breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation, (ii) a
breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this
Agreement or the Company in the Restructuring Agreement (or the Business
Transfer Documents referred to therein) to be performed following the Closing
and (iii) any Transaction Taxes allocable to Buyer under _Section 8.5(b)_
(collectively, "Seller Indemnifiable Claims").

  



  

(c)  As used herein, the term "Indemnified Party" means a Buyer
Indemnified Party when applied to _Section 9.2(a)_ hereof and means a Seller
Indemnified Party when applied to _Section 9.2(b)_ hereof; and the term
"Indemnifiable Claims" means Buyer Indemnifiable Claims when applied to
_Section 9.2(a)_ hereof and Seller Indemnifiable Claims when applied to
_Section 9.2(b)_ hereof.

  



  

Section 9.3   _Claim Procedure_.

  



  

(a)  An Indemnified Party seeking indemnity under this _Article
IX_ shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the party from whom
indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") promptly upon becoming
aware of the matters forming the basis of such Indemnifiable Claim, whether
the Damages sought arise from matters solely between the parties or from
third-party Indemnifiable Claims described in _Section 9.3(d)_. The Claim
Notice shall contain (i) a description of the matter and a good faith
estimate of the amount of the Damages (the "Claimed Amount") incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice, (iii) a demand for
payment of those Damages, and (iv) a certification that the Indemnified Party
has in good faith already sustained some (though not necessarily all) Damages
with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim.

  



  

(b) _Response to Claim Notice_. Within 30 days after delivery
of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response (the "Response") in which the
Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount and pay the Claimed Amount in
accordance with a payment and distribution method reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party or (ii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in such an event, the Response
shall be referred to as an  "Objection Notice"). If the Indemnifying Party
fails to deliver a Response in the required 30 day period, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have delivered an Objection Notice.

  



  

   

95

 



    



  

(c)   _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party disputes, or
is deemed to dispute, its obligation to pay the Claimed Amount pursuant to an
Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller Parent shall attempt in good faith to reach
an agreement as to the disputed matter. If Buyer and Seller Parent shall have
failed to resolve such disputed matters within 90 days from the Indemnifying
Party's receipt of the Objection Notice, then such outstanding dispute shall
be determined by litigation conducted in accordance with _Section 10.10_ of
this Agreement.

  



  

(d)   _Third-Party Claims_. Except with respect to any Tax
Contest, which shall be governed by _Section 8.6(f)_:

  



   | (i)| If an Indemnified Party receives notice or otherwise learns of
the assertion by a Person other than a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Parent Indemnified Party of any Indemnifiable Claim with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification under this
_Article IX_, the Indemnified Party shall give a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party within five days thereafter; provided, however, that no
delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability
hereunder except to the extent of any Liability caused by or arising out of
such failure or to the extent such delay or deficiency prejudices or
otherwise adversely affects the rights of the Indemnifying Party with respect
thereto. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the
defense of such suit or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume
control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| The party not controlling such defense (the "Non-Controlling
Party") may  participate therein at its own expense; provided, however, that
if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of  such defense and the
Indemnified Party concludes, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party have materially  conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to such suit or proceeding, the reasonable fees and  expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement. The  party controlling such defense (the "Controlling Party")
shall keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably  advised of the status of
such suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in good
faith recommendations  made by the Non-Controlling Party with respect
thereto. The Non-Controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with
such information as it may have with respect to such suit or proceeding
(including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading that may have
been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise
cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such
suit or proceeding. Each of Buyer and Seller Parent (or a duly authorized
Representative of such party) shall furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

  

   

96

 



    



   | (iii)| The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that the
consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying
Party agrees to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or
judgment, such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party with respect to the Indemnifiable Claim and the only remedy
required by such settlement or judgment is monetary. The Indemnified Party
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(e)   _Subrogation_. To the extent that the Indemnifying Party
makes or is required to make any indemnification payment to the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be
subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights
of contribution and other rights of recovery) that the Indemnified Party or
any of the Indemnified Party's Affiliates may have against any other Person
with respect to any Damages to which such indemnification payment is directly
related. Promptly following a request by an Indemnifying Party, such
Indemnified Party will take all reasonably necessary, proper or desirable
actions (including the execution and delivery of any document reasonably
requested) to accomplish the foregoing.

  



  

(f)   _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by it or any Person it controls from an
Indemnifiable Claim for which such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnification under this _Article IX_, including through the pursuit of any
Tax refund, upon becoming aware of any fact, event or circumstance which has
resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any such
Damage. If an Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after the Indemnifying
Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of
this Agreement in respect of such Damages, the Indemnified Party must notify
the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the value of the
benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation within 10 Business Days
after the benefit is received.

  



  

   

97

 



    



  

Section 9.4   _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

  



  

(a)  No Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or otherwise
responsible to any Indemnified Party for (i) punitive Damages, that arise out
of or relate to this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement, or the performance
or breach thereof or any liability retained or assumed hereunder or
thereunder or (ii) any Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) a
liability or reserve relating to such matter is expressly included in the
Business Financial Information (except to the extent relating to Taxes), (B)
the Indemnified Party has otherwise been compensated for such Damages
pursuant to an insurance policy or separate indemnity claim for a breach of
one or more other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements giving
rise to the same or duplicative Damages or (C) it was included in the
calculation of the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.5_. No party shall be entitled to rescission of this Agreement after
Closing as a result of breach of any other party's
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, or for any other matter
set forth herein.

  



  

(b)  The amount of any and all Damages shall be determined net
of any amounts actually recovered by any Buyer Indemnified Party under
insurance policies or from other collateral sources (such as contractual
indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with
respect to such Damages (after giving effect to any applicable deductible,
retention, collection costs, retrospectively rated premiums and actual
increase in future premiums primarily as a result of or incurred in connection
with the claim).

  



  

(c)  Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover
any Damages resulting from or in connection with any Tax for a Post-Closing
Tax Period, except to the extent any such Damages constitute Consolidated
Return Taxes or Transaction Taxes that are payable by Seller Parent under
_Section 8.6(b)_.

  



  

(d)  In any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers, under
insurance policies or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of
a matter for which such Buyer Indemnified Party was indemnified pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to
Seller Parent the amount so recovered (after giving effect to any applicable
deductible, retention, collection costs, retrospectively rated premiums and
actual increase in future premiums primarily as a result of or incurred in
connection with the claim) (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the
expenses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid
to or on behalf of such Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and
(ii) any amount expended by Seller Parent in pursuing or defending any
claim arising out of such matter.

  



  

(e)  (i) Seller Parent shall not be liable for any Buyer
Indemnifiable Claims pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ in an amount in excess
of the Purchase Price and (ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any Seller
Indemnifiable Claims pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ in an amount in excess
of the Purchase Price.

  



  

   

98

 



    



  

(f) Following the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section 9.2(a)_
 for any Damages arising under Environmental Law or relating to the Release
of Hazardous Materials and relating to any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property to the extent such Damages arise from or are the result of Buyer, its
Affiliates, the owner of the Business or its Affiliates, or their
representatives (a) undertaking excavation, drilling or similar intrusive
activities impacting the subsurface or invasive sampling or testing activities
of environmental media (including any soil, sediment, groundwater, or surface
water) or building material at the Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property other than: (i) as a result of any order or direction of any
Governmental Authority with authority to issue such order or direction
(provided such order or direction is not solicited by or on behalf of the
Buyer, its Affiliates, the owner of the Business or its Affiliates, or their
representatives for the purpose of triggering an indemnification right under
this Agreement), (ii) as required by applicable Law or any Permit or to
respond to a third-party claim, or (iii) in connection with any construction,
maintenance or repair activities or any excavation, drilling or similar
intrusive activities conducted in the ordinary course of operating the
Business and for a legitimate business purpose; (b) disclosing, without the
prior consent of Seller Parent, any presence or Release of any Hazardous
Materials in, to or from any environmental media that existed or occurred
prior to the Closing Date to any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property (it being understood that the
mere reporting of information as required by applicable Environmental Law or
any Permit shall not be construed as an unauthorized disclosure), or (c)
changing the zoning classification of any specific Owned Real Property after
the Closing Date to a non-commercial or non-industrial, as applicable, use.
Furthermore, Seller Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party under _Section 9.2(a)_ for any Damages for
any investigation, remediation or corrective action related to any
contamination or other environmental condition arising from a Release of
Hazardous Materials at any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property to the
extent such investigation, remediation or corrective action exceeds (i) that
which is required by applicable Environmental Law or any Permit or any Lease
first entered into prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) the most cost-effective
means of investigating, remediating or undertaking remedial or corrective
action regarding such contamination or other condition that is permitted
by Environmental Law and all Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over
such matter for the continued use of such Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property, consistent with its use at the time of the Closing Date (for the
avoidance of doubt, if the means of investigating, remediating or undertaking
corrective action is not the most cost-effective means, then Seller Parent
shall be liable for Damages up to the most cost-effective means and Buyer
shall be responsible for any Damages in excess of the most cost-effective
means).

  



  

Section 9.5   _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

From and after the Closing, except for payment of the Additional Payment
Amount pursuant to _Section 2.5_, the rights to reimbursement and
indemnification set forth in _Section 5.7(c)_ and _Section 5.12(b)_, claims
under the Transition Services Agreement or the Pulp Supply Agreement and
Fraud (collectively, the "Excluded Claims") _Section 9.2_ will provide the
exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or
other agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
preclude any party's right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in
respect of any other party's failure to fulfill or perform any of its
covenants, agreements or obligations contained herein or pursuant to the
Restructuring Agreement if such claim for injunctive or other equitable
relief is submitted within the applicable time period. Except for Excluded
Claims and as specifically set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section
9.2(b)_, Buyer and Seller Parent each waives on behalf of itself and all
other Indemnified Parties and its and their successors and assigns any other
claims that it or it's Indemnified Parties may have against the other party
and its or their representatives related to the Contemplated Transaction;
provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Buyer Indemnified Party from
seeking recovery, or recovering, against the RandW Insurance Policy
in accordance with its terms; provided further that nothing herein shall
operate to limit the Liability of any party to the other parties for Fraud in
the event such Fraud is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

  



   

99

 



    

   



  

Section 9.6   _Payment_.

  



  

(a)  All indemnification payments required to be made pursuant
to this _Article IX_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds by the Indemnifying Party to an account(s) provided by the Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(b)  Amounts paid in respect of indemnification obligations of
the parties shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
including all applicable Tax purposes.

  



  

Section 9.7   _R andW Insurance Policy_.

  



  

The parties acknowledge that, as of the date hereof, Buyer has bound the RandW
Insurance Policy and that a true and correct copy of such RandW
Insurance Policy has been delivered to Seller. The RandW Insurance Policy shall
provide that the insurer shall waive and not pursue any subrogation rights
against Seller, unless the Loss (as defined in the RandW Insurance Policy) is
caused by the Fraud of Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including _Section 9.4_), Buyer shall not be obligated
to make a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy for any Damages arising from
or related to a failure of a Seller Fundamental Representation or
representation contained in _Section 3.16_ to be true and correct until three
years after Closing and then only to the extent there is any limit remaining
under such policy after satisfaction of all pending claims thereunder.

  



  

Section 9.8   _Transfer of Indemnity_.

  



  

In the event that Seller Parent consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or assets to
any Person, then Seller Parent shall make proper provision in a written
agreement reasonably satisfactory to Buyer so that Seller Parent's successors
and assigns or, as applicable, the transferee of such properties or assets,
shall assume all of Seller Parent's obligations under this _Article IX_.

  



  

ARTICLE X 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 10.1   _Expenses_.

  



  

Except as otherwise set forth herein, each party will bear its respective
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, and
performance of the Transaction Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions,
including all fees and expenses of Representatives. For the avoidance of
doubt, all expenses incurred by any member of Seller Group in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by Seller or Seller Parent and
not by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

Section 10.3   _Waiver_.

  



  

The parties' rights and remedies are cumulative and not alternative. A
party's failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under
this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude _any_ other or
further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power, or privilege.

  



  

Section 10.4   _Entire Agreement and Amendments_.

  



  

The Transaction Agreements (including the exhibits and schedules included
herewith and therewith), together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
supersede all prior agreements between the parties with respect to their
respective subject matter and constitute a complete and exclusive statement
of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to the
respective subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Debt Financing Provision (and no other provision
of this Agreement to the extent that an amendment, supplement, change or
waiver of such provision would modify the substance of any Debt Financing
Provision) may be amended, supplemented, changed or waived in a manner
adverse to any Debt Financing Source Related Party without the prior written
consent of its related Debt Financing Source.

  



  

   

102

 



    



  

Section 10.5   _Assignments, Successors, and Third-Party Rights_.

  



  

No party hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of each other party hereto;
provided, however, that Buyer may, without any other party consent (a) grant a
security interest in, and collaterally assign, any of its rights under this
Agreement or any related agreement entered into in connection with
this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing, (b) assign any or all
of its rights and interests under this Agreement to one or more of its
Affiliates (in which case, Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations under this Agreement), (c) designate
one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations under this Agreement
(in which case, Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance
of all of its obligations under this Agreement), and (d) assign this
Agreement to a subsequent purchaser of all or a substantial portion of Buyer
(in which case, Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder). This Agreement will apply
to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than
the parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement
and all of its provisions and conditions are for the sole and exclusive
benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. Any
attempted assignment of this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 10.5 _shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall be an express third-
party beneficiary with respect to this _Section 10.5_, _Section 7.3(e)_,
_Section 7.3(f)_ , the last sentence of _Section 10.4_, the last sentence of
_Section 10.8_, _Section 10.9_, the last sentence of _Section 10.10, _the
last sentence of _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.18(b)_ (such provisions,
collectively, the "Debt Financing Provisions") (it being understood that the
foregoing provisions may not be amended, supplemented, changed or waived in a
manner adverse to any Debt Financing Source Related Party without the prior
written consent of its related Debt Financing Source).

  



  

Section 10.6   _Severability_.

  



  

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in
such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if
any term or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable
under applicable Law, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.7   _Section Headings_.

  



  

The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only
and will not affect its construction or interpretation. Unless otherwise
specified, references to " _Section_ " or " _Sections_ " refer to the
corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement.

Section 10.10   _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

Each party irrevocably agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its successors or
assigns shall be brought and determined in any State or federal court in the
State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transaction
Agreements and the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the parties agrees not
to commence any Legal Proceeding relating thereto except in the courts
described above in the State of New York, other than Legal Proceedings in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in New York as described herein. Each of the
parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
in New York as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) that (i) the Legal Proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such
Legal Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to _Section 10.18(b)_, each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any of its Affiliates to,
bring or support any Legal Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity and whether in contract or tort or otherwise, against the
Debt Financing Source Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including, but not limited
to, any dispute arising out of or relating to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof) in any forum other than the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, located in the Borough of Manhattan or, in either
case, any appellate court from any thereof.

Section 10.11   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly (a) the
parties shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief, and (c) the parties will waive, in any
action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law.
In circumstances where Buyer is obligated to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions and the Contemplated Transactions have not been consummated,
Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that Seller Group and its
stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will
be inadequate to compensate Seller Group, and that Seller on behalf of itself
and Seller Group shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to
enforce specifically Buyer's obligations to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, including to cause Buyer to cause the Equity Investors to fund
the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter.
Seller's pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an
election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or
remedy to which Seller Group may be entitled, including the right to pursue
remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by any member of
Seller Group and its stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance and payment of Buyer Termination Fee. The
parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance (or any other
equitable relief) to cause Buyer to effect the Closing on the terms and
subject to the conditions in this Agreement, only if: (i) all conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which to
be satisfied is caused by a breach by Buyer of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) shall have
been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or (to the
extent permissible under applicable Law) waived, (ii) the full amount of the
Debt Financing has been funded or would be funded at the Closing, and (iii)
Buyer has failed to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall Seller or any member of Seller Group and
its stockholders be entitled to or cause Buyer to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against the Debt Financing Sources, solely
in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the
Debt Financing.

  



  

Section 10.12   _Bulk Transfer Laws_.

  



  

Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and its Affiliates with the
provisions of any so called "bulk transfer law" of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Interests.

  



  

Section 10.13   _Disclosure Schedules_.

  



  

The Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules will be arranged
in sections corresponding to the sections contained in _Section 1.1_ or 
_Article III_, as applicable, and any reference in _Section 1.1_ or _Article
III_, as the case may be, to items "set forth on Schedule" or "Schedule
contains" or words of similar effect will be deemed to mean the section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as
the case may be, corresponding to the section or subsection of this Agreement
where such reference appears. The disclosures in any section or subsection of
the Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules will qualify
other sections or subsections in _Article III_ if it is reasonably apparent
that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections and subsections. No
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure
Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules shall be construed as an admission
or indication that such item or other matter is material (nor shall it
establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever) or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as the case may be.
The information set forth in the Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure
Schedules is disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no
information set forth therein shall be deemed to be an admission by Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, to any third-party of any matter whatsoever,
including any violation of Law or breach of any Contract. The Disclosure
Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules and the information and
disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations, warranties and covenants of Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
contained in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement or create any covenant. Matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedules and the Buyer Disclosure Schedules are
not necessarily limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected
in the Disclosure Schedules or the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, as the case
may be. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and
do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

Section 10.14   _No Other Duties_.

  



  

The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or obligations
shall be implied in fact, Law or equity, or under any principle of fiduciary
obligation.

  



  

Section 10.15   _Remedies_.

  



  

All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded to
the parties hereunder, shall be cumulative and not alternative, and
any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement will be
entitled to enforce such rights specifically, to recover damages by reason of
any breach of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by Law,
equity or otherwise.

  



  

Section 10.16   _Reliance on Counsel and Other Advisors_.

  



  

Each party has consulted such legal, financial, technical or other expert as
it deems necessary or desirable before entering into this Agreement. Each
party represents and warrants that it has read, knows, understands and agrees
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.17   _Legal Representation of the Parties_.

  



  

This Agreement was negotiated by the parties with the benefit of legal
representation and any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise
requiring this Agreement to be construed or interpreted against any party
shall not apply to any construction or interpretation hereof or to any other
Transaction Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.18   _Non-Recourse_.

  



  

(a) All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and are those solely of) the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto. No Person who is not
a party hereto, including without limitation (a) any director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to,
any party hereto, or (b) any director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the
foregoing (collectively, "Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance or breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, each party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates.
Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by law, each
party hereto hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands
or causes of action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or
granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a party hereto or
otherwise impose liability of a party hereto or any Non-Party Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise.

  



  

   

106

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Debt Financing
Source Related Party shall have any liability to Seller or any of its
Affiliates for any obligations or liabilities of Buyer or for any claim
(whether at law or equity, in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. In no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates (i) seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make or support any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Debt
Financing Source Related Party or (ii) seek to enforce the Debt Financing or
the Debt Commitment Letter against, make or support any claims for breach of
the Debt Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter against, or seek to recover
monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, any Debt Financing Source Related
Party for any reason, including in connection with the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letter or the obligations of the Debt Financing Source Related
Parties thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 10.18(b)_ does
not limit or affect any rights or remedies that Buyer may have against the
Debt Financing Source Related Parties pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

Section 10.19   _Counterparts and Delivery_.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which

when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.
Any signed counterpart of this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or
other form of electronic transmission ( _e.g._ , pdf), with the same legal
force and effect as delivery of an originally signed agreement.
