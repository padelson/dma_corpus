include a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identifies the Person making such Superior Proposal

the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt written notice (and in any event within three Business Days after it becomes

of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to any Financing

that could impact the funding or closing of the Financing, (B)&nbsp;of the receipt by Buyer of any written notice or other
communication from any Financing source with respect to (1)&nbsp;any material breach or default, termination or repudiation

dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Letters, any Fee Letter or any other definitive
document related to the Financing, in each case, that could impact the funding or closing of the Financing, and (C) if for
any reason Buyer believes in good faith that there is a reasonable possibility that it will not be able to obtain on a timely
basis all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing in any manner which impairs, delays or prevents the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three Business
Days of the date Seller delivers Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller
of which Buyer is aware relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence.</P>

otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly (a) the parties shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief, and (c) the parties will waive, in any action for
specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law. In circumstances where Buyer is obligated to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions and the Contemplated Transactions have not been consummated, Buyer expressly acknowledges and
agrees that Seller Group and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate
to compensate Seller Group, and that Seller on behalf of itself and Seller Group shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to enforce specifically
Buyer&rsquo;s obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, including to cause Buyer to cause the Equity Investors
to fund the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter. Seller&rsquo;s pursuit of specific
performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy
to which Seller Group may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered
by any member of Seller Group and its stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall Seller be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and payment of Buyer Termination Fee. The parties
hereto agree that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance (or any other equitable relief) to cause Buyer to effect the Closing on the terms and subject to the conditions
in this Agreement, only if: (i) all conditions set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;6.1</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;6.2</U> (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by
a breach by Buyer of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) shall have been
satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or (to the extent permissible under applicable Law) waived, (ii)
the full amount of the Debt Financing has been funded or would be funded at the Closing, and (iii) Buyer has failed to
complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall Seller or any member of Seller Group and its stockholders be entitled to
or cause Buyer to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against the Debt Financing Sources, solely in
their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.</P>
