_Stockholder Representative__ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent and Merger

this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _ _DGCL__ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger

by the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh

day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement or at such other place and time or on such other date as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing (the " _ _Closing Date__ "). 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a
Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective on the date and time on which the Certificate of Merger shall have
been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later date and time as may be agreed by the parties in writing and specified
in the Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective Time__ ").

1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " _ _Charter__ ") shall, subject to the
approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _ _SEC__ "), be
amended (the " _ _Amended Charter__ ") pursuant to the Certificate of Merger
as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and such Amended Charter shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

1.6. _The By-Laws_. Concurrently with the Effective Time, the by-laws of the
Company (the " _ _By-Laws__ ") shall, subject to the approval of the SEC, be
amended and restated in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _
_Amended By-Laws__ "), and such Amended By-Laws shall be the by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable Laws.

1.7. _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial governors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Laws until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the provisions
of the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and applicable
Laws.

1.8. _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE 2 

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Class B common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _ _Class B Share__ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) Dissenting
Shares and (y) any Class B Shares held in treasury by the Company or held by
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or  



 

\- 2 -  Merger Sub (each such Class B Share described in this clause (y), an " _
_Excluded Share__ ") (each such Class B Share not constituting an Excluded
Share or Dissenting Share, an " _ _Outstanding Share__ ")) shall be converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all of the Class B Shares
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _ _Certificate__ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any of the Class B Shares (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this Article 2. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _ _Merger
Consideration__ " shall mean the quotient of (A) (1) $652,000,000, _plus_
 (2) the Working Capital Surplus, if any, _minus_ (3) the Working Capital
Shortfall, if any, divided by (B) (1) the number of outstanding Class B Shares
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares,
but including, for the avoidance of doubt, Dissenting Shares), _plus_ (2) the
number of RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) " _
_Working Capital Shortfall__ " means the positive difference, if any, between
(A) the Target Working Capital, minus (B) the Closing Date Working Capital
Estimate; and (iii) " _ _Working Capital Surplus__ " means the positive
difference, if any, between (A) the Closing Date Working Capital Estimate,
minus (B) the Target Working Capital.

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the
Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. The one outstanding share
of Series A Preferred Stock shall remain issued and outstanding and
unaffected by the Merger.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.2. _Payment of Cash for Class B Shares and RSUs_.

(a) _Disbursing Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to serve
as the disbursing agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect
of the RSUs (the " _ _Disbursing Agent__ "). Prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Disbursing Agent
cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay (i) the Closing Merger
Consideration in respect of all Class B Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (except as provided in Section 2.4) and (ii) any cash
necessary to pay the Closing Merger Consideration in respect of the RSUs
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such cash referred to in
subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) being hereinafter referred to as the " _
_Exchange Fund__ "). Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the
Disbursing Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Class B Shares and RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall not be used for any other purposes; provided,
however, that Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in
(i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United  



 

\- 3 -  States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money
market accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or bankers acceptances of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks having
a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, or (iii) commercial
paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and Poors Corporation
or Moodys Investor Services, Inc. Any profit or loss resulting from, or
interest and other income produced by, such investments shall be for the
account of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Closing
Merger Consideration__ " shall mean the quotient of (A) (i) $652,000,000,
_plus_ (ii) the Working Capital Surplus, if any, _minus_ (iii) the Working
Capital Shortfall, if any, _minus_ (iv) the Reconciliation Deposit, divided
by (B) (i) the number of outstanding Class B Shares as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares, but including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Dissenting Shares), _plus_  (ii) the number of RSUs as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each
record holder of Class B Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Class B Shares
for the Closing Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of
transmittal will be in customary form and will specify that delivery of
Certificates will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such
Certificate(s) to the Disbursing Agent together with a properly completed and
duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation that the
Disbursing Agent may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor,
without interest. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate
shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate, and
until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of
such outstanding Certificate in respect thereof.

(ii) If payment is to be made to any individual, corporation (including not-
for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature (a " _ _Person__ ") other than the
registered holder of the Class B Shares formerly represented by the
Certificate(s) surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable stock
transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Class B Shares or establish to the satisfaction
of the Disbursing Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are
not payable.

(c) _Stock Transfer Books_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Class B
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Disbursing Agent, such shares shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article 2\.



 

\- 4 - (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. If any cash deposited with the
Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time,
such cash shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon
demand, and any holder who has not surrendered such holders Certificate(s)
for the Closing Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Disbursing Agent or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates for an amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Certificates as of the date on which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by such holder of any bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent with respect to
such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Closing Merger Consideration in respect
thereof entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Class B Shares or RSUs
pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. To
the extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law, any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

2.3. _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time, each RSU
granted by the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and the
holder thereof will be entitled to receive from Parent and Merger Sub an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration without interest in the
manner and at the times contemplated by this Agreement.

2.4. _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Class B Shares held by a
holder who has properly demanded in writing appraisal for such Class B Shares
in accordance with Section 262 (or any successor provision) of the DGCL (any
such shares being referred to as " _ _Dissenting Shares__ " until such time
as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses or withdraws such holders
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration specified  



 

\- 5 -  in Section 2.1(a) or cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof or any
dividends or other distributions but shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares unless and until
such shares cease to be Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall be thereupon be treated as
though such shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) as of the Closing Date.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Parent prompt notice
(and a copy thereof) of any written demand for appraisal, for payment or of
objection to the Merger received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, any written withdrawal of any such demand and any other
written demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time that relates to such a demand. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle,
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, in each such case
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) or unless required by any Law.

2.5. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Company changes
the number of Class B Shares prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

2.6. _Net Working Capital; Tax Gross Up Payments_.

(a) _Closing Determination_. (i) Not more than seven (7) Business Days nor
less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall,
in good faith using then available financial information for the Company,
prepare and deliver to Parent a separate report (the " _ _Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet__ ") setting forth an estimate of the Adjusted Working Capital
as of the Effective Time on the Closing Date (the " _ _Closing Date Working
Capital Estimate__ ") and the calculation thereof, which amount shall be based
on the estimated Current Assets and the estimated Current Liabilities as set
forth on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. The Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and in
accordance with the definition of " _ _Adjusted Working Capital__ " and the
parameters set forth in Section 2.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If
(A) the Closing Date Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Target Working
Capital, the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be increased on a dollar-
for-dollar basis at Closing by the amount of such excess and (B) the Closing
Date Working Capital Estimate is less than the Target Working Capital, the
aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis
at Closing by the amount of such deficiency, with such increase or
reduction to be allocated to Holders in with such Holders Pro Rata Share.



 

\- 6 - (ii) Not more than seven (7) Business Days nor less than three (3) Business
Days before the Closing Date, the Companys outside auditors shall calculate
and determine the amount of Severance Benefits Gross-Up Payments, Designated
Tax Gross Up Payments and Excess Tax Gross Up Payments (and shall perform all
such calculations and make all such determinations required in order to
calculate and determine the amounts of Severance Benefits Gross-Up Payments,
Designated Tax Gross Up Payments and Excess Tax Gross-Up Payments) in
consultation with the Company and Parent, and shall take into account such
information and analysis as the Company and Parent may provide. The
determination of the amounts of Severance Benefits Gross-Up Payments,
Designated Tax Gross Up Payments and Excess Tax Gross-Up Payments shall be
made in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder and all present value calculations shall be made using the discount
rates and methodology used for calculating present values under Section 280G
of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement: (A) " _ _Excess Tax Gross-Up
Payments__ " means (1) the total present value (as of the Effective Time) of
all "Tax Gross-Up Payments" (within the meaning of the Employment Agreements)
that will be paid or are reasonably expected to be paid pursuant to the terms
of the Employment Agreements, _minus_ (2) the sum of (i) the lesser of (aa)
the sum of all Designated Tax Gross-Up Payments with respect to individuals
receiving Designated CIC Payments or (bb) $8,000,000; and (ii) the sum of all
Severance Benefit Gross-Up Payments; (B) " _ _Designated Tax Gross-Up
Payments__ " means, with respect to any individual receiving a Designated CIC
Payment, the total amount of the Tax Gross-Up Payments (within the meaning of
the Employment Agreements) to be paid or reasonably expected to be paid, that
is allocable to the individuals Designated CIC Payment, with such allocable
amount being determined based on the ratio of such Designated CIC Payment to
the total present value (as of the Effective Time) of all "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) to be made, or reasonably
expected to be made, with respect to such individual in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (C) " _ _Severance Benefit Gross-
Up Payments__ " means, with respect to any individual receiving Severance
Benefits, the total amount of the Tax Gross-Up Payments (within the meaning
of the Employment Agreements) to be paid or reasonably expected to be paid,
that is allocable to the individuals Severance Benefits, with such allocable

") listing those items, if any, to which Parent takes exception, which notice
shall also (i) specifically identify, and provide a reasonably detailed
explanation of (1) any deviation that Parent believes to exist between the
methodology used to calculate the Closing Date Working Capital Estimate and

disputed shall be deemed to be accepted and agreed by the
Stockholder Representative. If Stockholder Representative gives Parent notice
of objections to the Proposed Adjustments, and if Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of
receipt by Parent of the notice by the Stockholder Representative of
objections, to resolve the  



 

\- 8 -  disputed exceptions, such disputed exceptions will be referred to an
accounting firm jointly selected by Parent and the Stockholder Representative)
(the " _ _Independent Accounting Firm__ "). The Independent Accounting Firm
shall, within thirty (30) calendar days following the date of its selection,
deliver to Parent and the Stockholder Representative a written
report determining such disputed exceptions, and its determinations will be
final, conclusive and binding upon Parent and each of the Holders for the
purposes of any purchase price adjustment under _Section 2.6(d)_ hereof. The
fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by
Parent in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by Parent (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted, and the balance shall be allocated equally to the Holders.

(d) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The aggregate Merger Consideration shall be
increased or decreased, as the case may be, on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
an amount equal to the difference between the Closing Date Working Capital
Estimate and the Adjusted Working Capital as determined in accordance with
_Section 2.6(c)_ above. If the Adjusted Working Capital exceeds the Closing
Date Working Capital Estimate, the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess and Parent
shall pay such excess to the Holders in accordance with the terms of _Section
2.6(e)_ below. If the Adjusted Working Capital is less than the Closing Date
Working Capital Estimate, the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced
on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficiency and such
deficiency shall be paid to Parent from the Reconciliation Amount. Within
five (5) business days of the completion of any adjustments to the
Reconciliation Fund contemplated in this _Section 2.6(d)_, the Escrow Agent
shall distribute to each Holder such Holders Pro Rata Share of any amounts
that are remaining in the Reconciliation Fund in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Reconciliation Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parents recoveries pursuant to this  _Section 2.6_ shall be limited to the
amount in the Reconciliation Fund.

(e) _Payment to Holders_. If the Adjusted Working Capital exceeds the Closing
Date Working Capital Estimate, the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such excess, and
Parent shall, within five (5) calendar days following the date of delivery of
the final Closing Balance Sheet to Parent and the Stockholder Representative
as contemplated by _Section 2.6(c)_ above, (i) deposit such excess into the
Reconciliation Fund (with the Reconciliation Amount adjusted upward to
reflect the amount deposited) and (ii) direct that the Escrow Agent promptly
distribute to each Holder such Holders Pro Rata Share of the Reconciliation
Amount (as adjusted for the amount deposited pursuant to clause (i)
hereof and after providing for the payment of any expenses of the Stockholder
Representative contemplated in Section 2.7) in accordance with the terms of

the Code (a " _ _Company ERISA Affiliate__ ") since the effective date of
ERISA that has not been satisfied in full when due, and no condition exists
that presents a material risk to the Company, any Subsidiary or any Company
ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title or such Sections

corrective action pursuant to such system in order to maintain the qualified
status of such Company Plan. Each of the Company Plans that is intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 125 or 501(c)(9) of the Code satisfies
such requirements. Each of the Company Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. Each Company

other service provider of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
becoming entitled to severance pay or any similar payment, (ii) the

Subsidiaries has been, and is, properly classified by the Company or any of

clauses (A) and (B) above, (a) the Board of Governors of the Company shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors

reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal from the Person that has
made the applicable Acquisition Proposal and (b) the Board of Governors, after

capable of being consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and similar aspects of, and conditions
to, the proposal, and the Person making the proposal, and, if consummated,
would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders
(in their capacity as stockholders) from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to
the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in response to a Notice of
Superior Proposal or otherwise pursuant to Section 5.2(b)); providing that for
purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal, the term Acquisition Proposal
shall have the meaning assigned above, except that references to "20%" shall
be deemed to be references to "80%."

(b) Neither the Board of Governors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
Governors Recommendation or the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Governors or any such committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose to recommend, adopt or
approve, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement described in clauses (A) and (B) of Section 5.2(a)).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary, prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Board of Governors of the Company
may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal, withdraw, amend or modify the
Governors Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, recommend or publicly
propose to recommend an Acquisition Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement
(subject to Section 7.3) in order to accept an Acquisition Proposal, if and
only if (1) the Board of Governors of the Company  



 

\- 36 -  determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and legal counsel, that (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such actions would result in
a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (2) the Company has
complied in all material respects with this Section 5.2; _provided_  
_however_ that the Board of Governors may not take such action until after the
fifth business day following the receipt by Parent of written notice from the
Company (a " _ _Notice of Superior Proposal__ ") advising Parent of the
Companys intent to withdraw, amend or modify the Governors Recommendation or
recommend or propose to recommend an Acquisition Proposal to the Companys
stockholders or terminate this Agreement, that the Board of Governors of the
Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that (i) during the five business day
period after receipt by Parent of a Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and (ii) the Company may
take any such action with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was a
Superior Proposal only if such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal in light of any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to which Parent shall have agreed prior to the
expiration of such five business day period. The Company agrees that it will
deliver to Parent a new Notice of Superior Proposal with respect to
each Acquisition Proposal that has been materially revised or modified prior
to taking any action pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 5.2(b)
and that a new five business day period shall commence, for purposes of
this Section 5.2(b), with respect to each such materially revised or modified
Acquisition Proposal from the time Parent receives a Notice of Superior
Proposal with respect thereto. For purposes of this Section 5.2(b), the only
days that shall not be considered "business days" shall be Saturdays, Sundays
and Thanksgiving Day (November 22, 2007).

(c) The Company shall, and shall direct each of its Representatives to,
immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal. 

(d) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent as promptly as practicable
(and, in any event, within 24 hours) if any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of
its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, on the status and
terms of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

5.3.  _Shareholders Approval_. The Company Requisite Vote shall be obtained
by stockholder written consent in accordance with applicable Laws and the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, on, but no earlier than
5:00 p.m. on the 20th calendar day following the date Parent first files a
Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC regarding the Merger, which Current
Report on Form 8-K shall contain as an exhibit thereto a true, correct and
complete copy of the executed Merger Agreement (the " _ _Parent 8-K Date__ "),
in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreements (the " _
_Written Consent__ "). The Company will use its  



 

\- 37 -  reasonable best efforts to obtain the Written Consent and notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement, (i) in the event that subsequent to
the date of this Agreement the Board of Governors of the Company determines
in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws require it to withdraw, modify or amend
the Governors Recommendation in any manner, the Board of Governors of the
Company may, prior to the receipt of the Written Consent, so withdraw, modify
or amend the Governors Recommendation and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing
(or Section 5.2(b)), the Company shall, subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.3, submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption by
the Written Consent and shall use its best efforts to do so within the time
period prescribed herein. As promptly as practicable, but no more than 20
calendar days, after receipt of sufficient executed Written Consents to
approve this Agreement and the Merger, the Company shall deliver, pursuant to
Section 228 of the DGCL (and in accordance with applicable law), a written
notice to all stockholders of the Company that did not execute the Written
Consent informing them that this Agreement and the Merger were adopted and
approved by the stockholders of the Company. As promptly as practicable, but
no later than the earlier of (i) the 20th calendar day following the transfer
of 14% of the interests of the defendants pursuant to the litigation pending
against the Company captioned __Ginsburg__ v. __Philadelphia Stock Exch., Inc.
et al.__ (as described below) and (ii) the 10th calendar day following the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver, pursuant to Section 262(d) of the
DGCL (and in accordance with applicable law), a written notice to all
stockholders of the Company that did not execute the Written Consent
informing them that statutory appraisal rights are available for their Shares
(which notice shall include a copy of such Section 262). The Company shall
provide Parent with the opportunity to review and reasonably comment on the
information statement included with such notice.

5.4. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. 

(a) The Company and Parent shall, subject to the final sentences of Sections
5.1(ii) and 5.4(d) in the case of Parent, cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable,
complying at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
information or documentary material received from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity, all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall make the filings required pursuant to
the HSR Act within 10 business days of the date of execution of this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult the other on, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in  



 

\- 38 -  connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the extent permitted by Law, each party shall provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and
meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall include Representatives of Parent and the Company. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or
any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change, fact
or condition which, to the Companys Knowledge, is reasonably expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition
to Parents obligations to effect the Merger. Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company of any change, fact or condition which, to Parents Knowledge,
is reasonably expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect or of any
failure of any condition to the Companys obligations to effect the Merger.

(d) Parents and the Companys obligations under this Section 5.4 shall
include, without limitation, the obligation to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, or any other actions by a Governmental Entity,
challenging the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to seek to have
any stay or other injunctive relief which would prevent or materially delay or
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity reversed on appeal or
vacated. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement, as it
relates to Parent, "reasonable best efforts" shall not require Parent or any
of its Affiliates in connection with approvals to be sought from the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to (i) sell,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of any of its material assets or the
material assets of their Subsidiaries or the material assets of the Company

the amendments to the certificates of incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub,
Parent and/or the Company or alternative changes to market or regulatory
structure as may be required to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and its Board of Directors and the Company
and its Board of Governors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to provide such information to the SEC and CFTC as is reasonably determined
to be prudent by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

5.5. _Access and Reports_. 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other
authorized Representatives (including environmental consultants) reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish

shall issue a joint press release in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.

with, or rules of, any national securities exchange or by the request of any
Governmental Entity.

than that provided immediately before the Closing Date; provided that the
foregoing shall not be construed as a guaranty of employment for any employee,
including any Continuing Employee all of whom shall be "at will" employees
except to the extent the employee is a party to an employment agreement
listed on Section 5.7(a) of the Disclosure Schedules; _provided_ _that_ , if a
Continuing Employees employment is terminated within such one-year period,
such Continuing Employee shall be provided with severance benefits that are
either substantially similar to (i) those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent or Surviving Corporation (or its Affiliates), or (ii)

policy in effect as of the date hereof).

(c) During the period ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Continuing Employees, while employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans of
Parent, Surviving Corporation (including in the discretion of Parent, one or
more of the Company Plans), or their Affiliates (the " _ _Parent Plans__ ")
that provide employee benefits that in the aggregate are no less favorable (as
reasonably determined by Parent in its sole discretion) than those afforded to
other similarly situated employees of Parent (or its Affiliates). Seller
shall provide the Continuing Employees with full credit for all years of
service with the Company for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for
benefit accrual purposes) under any applicable Parent Plan and for the
purposes of determining levels of vacation and severance benefits under any
applicable Parent Plan. The Continuing Employees shall participate under any
Parent Plan that provides medical, dental, life and other insurance benefits
without any waiting periods or evidence of insurability or application of any
pre-existing condition restrictions (except to the extent any such limitation

the participant then participates or is otherwise  



 

\- 41 -  eligible to participate). Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate

the Company an open enrollment period for the Parent Plans and employee
orientation sessions (with such sessions to be held at times reasonably agreed
to by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub), and (ii) meet with employees of the
Company (either individually or in groups) during breaks, outside of

immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _ _Retiree Health Plan__ ").
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or other Affiliate of
Parent to, provide to the Retiree Life Retirees retiree life insurance
benefits that are no less favorable than the $5,000 per person retiree life
insurance benefit provided by the Company pursuant to the GE Group Life
Insurance Policy as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _
_Retiree Life Insurance Plan__ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _
_Retiree Medical Retiree__ " means any former employee of the Company (and

Corporation, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide to the Retiree Medical Employees (and such employees dependents, if

arrangements that are no less favorable than the retiree health benefits such
Retiree Medical Employees would have received pursuant to the Retiree Health
Plan had their employment with the Company terminated effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Following a termination of employment from the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide to the Retiree Life Employees (and such
employees dependents, if applicable) retiree life insurance benefits that are
no less favorable than the retiree life insurance benefits such Retiree Life
Employees would have received pursuant to the Retiree Life Insurance Plan had
their employment with the Company terminated effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Retiree Medical
Employee__ " means any Continuing Employee who was eligible to retire and
receive retiree health benefits under the Retiree Health Plan as of the
Closing Date (or  



 

\- 42 -  would become eligible to retire and receive such benefits within three years
of the Closing Date). For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Retiree
Life Employee__ " means any Continuing Employee who was eligible to retire
and receive the $5,000 retiree life insurance benefit under the Retiree Life
Insurance Plan as of the Closing Date (or would become eligible to retire and
receive such benefit within three years of the Closing Date).

(h) No provision of this Section 5.7 shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Continuing Employee or any other employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent of any Continuing Employee or other
employee or former employee) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment). Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as an amendment of any Parent Plan or other
employee benefit plan, program or policy of the Parent, Surviving Corporation
or an Affiliate of Parent.

(i) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to honor (i) each employment or consulting agreement set forth on Schedule
3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (ii) each change in control,
severance, retention, or similar plan, policy, or arrangement set forth on
Schedule 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending
or terminating any such agreement, contract, plan or policy in accordance with
its terms and applicable law.

5.8. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.7 and 7.5, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

5.9. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of
the current or former governors, directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ ") shall survive the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall continue in full force and effect at the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with their terms, and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
5.9, without limit as to time.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent (i) permitted under
applicable Laws and (ii) provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each
of the foregoing) the Indemnified Parties against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or  



 

\- 43 -  investigative (an " _ _Action__ "), arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred
before the Closing (including acts or omissions in connection with such
persons serving as an officer, governor, director or other fiduciary in any
entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or
its Subsidiaries) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such Action. Parent shall
guarantee the financial obligations of the Surviving Corporation imposed by
this Section 5.9(b).

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, either maintain the Companys existing officers and
directors liability insurance or make available the Parents existing
officers and directors liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__")
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) for each such
Indemnified Party covered as of the Effective Time by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof, for a period of six years after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth in Section
5.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) for such insurance (such 300% amount,
the " _ _Maximum Annual Premium__ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Alternatively,
the Company will purchase, if requested by Parent, a six-year " _tail_ "
prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and, if such "tail"
prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term,
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, and all other
obligations under this Section 5.9(c) shall terminate.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.9 applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs
and legal representatives.



 

\- 44 - 5.10. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 5.1(ii) and
5.4(d), the each of the Company and Parent shall, and each shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with applicable Law to consummate
and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.11. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Parent and its Board of Directors and the Company and its Board of Governors
shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary so
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and by the Merger and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

stockholders of the Company shall pay any sales, use, ad valorem, property,
transfer (including real property transfer) and similar Taxes imposed on such
Person as a result of or in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such taxes may not be
assessed pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1146(c); provided, however, that the
Company shall be liable for any such Tax that is imposed on its stockholders
in respect of assets that are owned directly or indirectly by the Company.

5.13. _Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Trading Floor_. So long as the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. maintains floor-based trading, a condition
which is directly tied to the economic viability of such trading, among other
things, a floor will be located in Philadelphia.

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect and which do not
provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the Company, Parent or their
respective directors or officers would be subject to the risk of criminal
liability. 

(d) _Resolution of Shareholder Litigation_. The order of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware approving the settlement of the litigation pending
against the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware,
captioned __Ginsburg_ v. _Philadelphia Stock Exch., Inc., et al.__ , shall not
have been appealed within the time period permitted therefor, or, in the
event of any appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, the appeal shall no longer
be pending and such order shall not have been reversed or modified in a manner
which the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the exercise of
its reasonable judgment, determines to be other than a minor or immaterial
modification thereof.

Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are also subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:

and warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any materiality or the Company Material Adverse
Effect qualifications contained therein) would not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
(ii) Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company
by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company as
to the matters set forth in clause (i) of this Section 6.2(a).

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Company_. The Company shall have

(d) _Certain Litigation_. No Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have instituted and shall not have withdrawn any proceeding seeking any
Order and no Governmental Entity shall have instituted any civil, criminal or
administrative action, suit, claim, hearing, investigation or other proceeding

failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.1(c).

there shall not have occurred any change, event, circumstance or development

representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier
date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be

Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained therein) would not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) the Company shall have received a certificate signed on

and remedies available at law or in equity. 



 

\- 49 - (b) In the event that:

(i) (A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (but substituting 50% for the 20%
threshold set forth in the definition thereof (a " _ _Covered Proposal__ ")
shall have been made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its
stockholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether
or not conditional) to make a Covered Proposal with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (and such Covered Proposal or publicly
announced intention shall not have been withdrawn at the time of termination
of this Agreement) and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(a) (Termination Date) or Section
7.2(b) (No Shareholder Approval), and if all conditions in Section 6.1
(Conditions to Each Partys Obligation to Effect the Merger) (other than
Section 6.1(a) (Shareholder Approval)) and Section 6.3 (Conditions to
Obligation of the Company) would have been satisfied, and

(B) within 12 months of any such termination:



     | (1) | any Person (other than Parent) ( an " _ _Acquiring Party__
") has acquired, by purchase, merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, lease,
transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any related series of
transactions, a majority of the voting power of the outstanding securities of
the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, 
---|---|--- 


     | (2) | there has been consummated a merger, consolidation or
similar business combination between the Company and an Acquiring Party, or 
---|---|--- 


     | (3) | any definitive agreement for a transaction described in the
foregoing clauses (1) and (2) is entered into; 
---|---|--- 
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.4(a)
(Withdrawal or Modification of Governors Recommendation; Recommendation of
Acquisition Proposal); or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.3(a)
(Superior Proposal);

then, in the case of a termination referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
above, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than one business
day after the date of such termination (except with respect to termination
pursuant to clause (i) above, in which case payment shall be made no later
than one business day following the entry into any definitive agreement
with or consummation of the applicable transaction with the Acquiring Party
and except with respect to termination pursuant to clause (iii) above, in
which case payout shall be concurrent with such termination), pay Parent a
termination fee of $22,820,000 (as applicable, the " _ _Company Termination
Fee__ "), payable by wire transfer of same day funds, it being understood that
in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. In the event that a proposal regarding a Covered
Proposal shall have been made known to the public or shall have been made
directly to its stockholders generally or any person  



 

\- 50 -  shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional or
withdrawn) to make a proposal regarding a Covered Proposal that reasonably
appears to be bona fide and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and no Company Termination Fee is
yet payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(i), then the Company
shall pay to Parent all of the Expenses (as hereinafter defined) of Parent
and Merger Sub and thereafter if the Company becomes obligated to pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(i) such payment
obligation shall be reduced by the amount of Expenses previously actually
paid to Parent pursuant to this sentence. As used herein, " _ _Expenses__ "
shall mean all reasonable out-of-pocket documented fees and expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants,
financial advisors and investment bankers of Parent and its Affiliates),
incurred by Parent or Merger Sub or on their behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement and all other matters related to the
Merger; provided that such fees and expenses shall not in any case exceed
$8,000,000 in the aggregate.

The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount
due pursuant to this Section 7.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee, charges or expenses to which reference is made in this
paragraph (b), the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Bank of
America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby
acknowledge that in the event that the Company Termination Fee becomes
payable and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.5(b), the
Company Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.

8.8. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 5.9

with respect to the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Article 2 hereof.

8.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a

deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of
the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

8.10. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that

injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any
action instituted in any court of the United States or any state
thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to
any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in equity.

the page of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.



 

\- 54 - 8.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed

affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

8.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed
to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference
in this Agreement is made to a Section, Exhibit or Annex, such reference shall
be to a Section of or Exhibit or Annex to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent has or may have set forth information in
its respective disclosure letter in a Section thereof that corresponds to the
Section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
Section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other Section of
the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter Section of
the disclosure letter or Section of the Agreement is readily apparent on the
face of the information disclosed in the disclosure letter to the Person to
which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such
information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein, taken alone, shall not
be determinative in interpreting the terms "material," "Company Material
Adverse Effect," "Parent Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in
this Agreement.

8.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Subject to Section 5.9(d), no party may assign this Agreement or assign or
delegate any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the
prior written approval of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may assign and delegate any of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of Parent, _provided_ _that_ such
Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by all of the applicable provisions
hereof governing such rights, interests and obligations to the same extent as
Parent is bound and provided further that Parent shall continue to be bound by
all of the obligations hereunder as if such assignment had not occurred and to
perform such obligations to the extent  



 

\- 55 -  such Affiliate fails to do so, and that the Company promptly receive written
notice of any such assignment and delegation. Any purported assignment
in violation of this Agreement will be void _ab initio_.

8.15. _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no officer, director or stockholder of the Company shall have any liability
in such capacity to Parent or Merger Sub as such with respect to this
Agreement.

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
November 6, 2007, by and among The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and [NAME OF STOCKHOLDER] (the " _Stockholder_ ").

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent,
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Pinnacle Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") that provides for the merger (the
" _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the terms
thereof;

WHEREAS, as an essential condition and inducement to Parent to enter into the
Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, the Stockholder and Parent
have agreed to enter into this Agreement;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder is the record holder and
beneficial owner of [ _ _] shares of Class B common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Stockholder s Shares_");

WHEREAS, the Stockholder and Parent have agreed that this Agreement shall only
relate to [ _ _]1 of the Stockholders Shares (such portion of
the Stockholders Shares, together with any shares of the Company for which
such portion of the Stockholders Shares may be exchanged or converted, the "
_Subject Shares_ ") and desires to enter into this Agreement solely
with respect to such Subject Shares (for purposes of this Agreement,
"beneficial ownership" shall have the meaning given to such term in Rule 13d-3
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_
")); 

WHEREAS, the Stockholder and Parent agree that this Agreement is not
applicable to, and the Stockholder is not making any
representations, warranties or covenants with respect to, any of the
Stockholders Shares other than the Subject Shares; and

WHEREAS, Parent desires the Stockholder to agree, and the Stockholder is
willing to agree, (i) not to transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the
Subject Shares prior to the Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1.1 below)
and (ii) to vote the Subject Shares so as to facilitate consummation of the
Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:

* * *

   1 | Share number to be net of number of shares to be transferred
pursuant to the Ginsburg settlement. ---|---|--- 

1.1  _Transfer and Encumbrance_. The Stockholder agrees not to transfer
(except as may be specifically required by court order or to any affiliate of
the Stockholder or any affiliate of a parent company of the Stockholder),
sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber any of the Subject
Shares or to make any offer or agreement relating thereto other than in
accordance with the Merger, at any time prior to the Expiration Date. As used
herein, the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earliest to occur of:
(a) such date and time as the Merger shall become effective in accordance with
the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, (b) such date as the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms and provisions thereof, (c)
July 31, 2008, and (d) any amendment of the Merger Agreement that reduces the
Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) payable to the
Stockholder or changes in a manner adverse to the Stockholder the time and
manner of payment of the Merger Consideration; provided that no amendment made
to the Merger Agreement in response to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) that the Board of Governors of the Company has
determined to be a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
pursuant to Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement shall be deemed to be covered
by this clause (d).

1.2 _Agreement to Vote Shares_. From the date hereof until the Expiration
Date, at every meeting of the stockholders of the Company, and at every
adjournment or postponement thereof, and, in the case of the following clause
(ii) on every action or approval by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company, the Stockholder irrevocably and unconditionally agrees and covenants
that the Stockholder shall, including by prompt written consent if requested
by Parent, vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Shares (i) in favor of
adoption of the Merger Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to
time) (provided that with respect to the Written Consent on but not before
5:00 p.m. on the 20th calendar day following the date on which Parent files a
Current Report on Form 8-K as referenced in, and meeting the requirements of,
the penultimate sentence of this Section 1.2) (ii) against any amendment of
the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other proposal,
transaction, agreement or Acquisition Proposal involving the Company or any of
its subsidiaries which amendment or other proposal or transaction could be
reasonably expected to materially impede, frustrate, prevent, interfere with,
postpone, delay, discourage, adversely effect or nullify, or result in a
material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of the Company under or with respect to, the Merger,
the Merger Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and (iii) in favor of any amendment or modification to the
proposed certificate of incorporation and bylaws attached as exhibits to the
Merger Agreement that may reasonably be requested or suggested by the
Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff (it being understood that the
Stockholder shall not be obligated to vote for any such amendment or
modification that would adversely affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the Stockholder). In the event that a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company is held, the Stockholder shall appear at such meeting or otherwise
cause the Subject Shares owned by the Stockholder to be counted as
present for purposes of establishing a quorum. On, but no earlier than 5:00
p.m. on, the 20th calendar day following the date on which Parent first files
a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission
regarding the Merger, which Current Report on Form 8-K shall contain as an
exhibit thereto a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Merger
Agreement, the Stockholder shall irrevocably execute and deliver with respect
to the Subject Shares to the Company its respective counterpart of the form of
Written  



 

-2-  Consent of the stockholders of the Company attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Written Consent_ "). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, the Stockholder shall not be required to vote, consent or grant any
proxy in favor of any action or proposal that, if approved by the stockholders
of the Company, would extend the Termination Date (as defined in the
Merger Agreement).

1.3 _Irrevocable Proxy_. By entering into this Agreement, effective
immediately following the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and
the expiration of the 20-day period described above, the Stockholder hereby
grants a proxy appointing Parent, with full power of substitution, as such
Stockholders attorney-in-fact and proxy, for and in such Stockholders name,
to be counted as present, to vote or to otherwise act on behalf of the
Stockholder at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (including any
adjournments and postponements thereof), in each case solely with respect to
the Subject Shares, and to act for the Stockholder (solely with respect to
the Subject Shares) on every action or approval by written consent of the
stockholders of the Company and to deliver such documents and consents as may
be required by the Stockholder (including, without limitation, the Written
Consent) with respect to its Subject Shares, in each case solely in the manner
contemplated by Section 1.2 (including in favor of adoption of the Merger
Agreement) and to execute and deliver any written consents to fulfill the
Stockholders obligations under this Agreement; provided that in no event
shall the power of attorney and proxy granted hereby be exercised to take or
approve of any action that would extend the Termination Date. The proxy
granted by the Stockholder pursuant to this Section 1.3 is irrevocable and is
granted in order to secure the Stockholders performance under this Agreement
and is also in consideration of the entry of Parent and Merger Sub into this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement. If the Stockholder fails for any reason to
be counted as present or to vote or to execute and deliver written consents
with respect to the Subject Shares in accordance with the requirements
of Section 1.2 above, then Parent shall have the right, pursuant to this
Section 1.3, to cause to be present or vote or to execute and deliver written
consents with respect to the Subject Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 1.2. The proxy granted by the Stockholder pursuant to this Section
1.3 shall terminate automatically upon the earlier of termination of the
Merger Agreement prior to the Effective Time and the Termination Date (as
defined in the Merger Agreement). This proxy is, and the Stockholder agrees
and acknowledges that this proxy is, coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable until the Expiration Date.

1.4 _Revocation of Previous Proxies_. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and
all proxies granted with respect to the Subject Shares, prior to the proxy set
forth in Section 1.3.

1.5 _Intentionally Omitted_.

1.6  _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Stockholder_. Subject
to the Stipulation of Settlement, dated as of September 4, 2007, in connection
with the action titled _Ginsburg_ v. _Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
_et al_. (C.A. No. 2202-CC)_, the Stockholder hereby represents, warrants and
covenants to Parent as follows:

(a) _Ownership of the Subject Shares; Authority_. The Stockholder (i) is the
record and beneficial owner of the Subject Shares, which at the date hereof
and at all times up until the Expiration Date will be free and clear of any
liens, claims, options, charges or other encumbrances of a material nature;
(ii) has full power and authority to make, enter into and carry out the terms
of this Agreement; and (iii) is not a party to any voting trusts, proxies or
any other agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of the
Subject Shares.



 

-3- (b) _No Conflicts or Consents_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Stockholder does not, and the performance by the Stockholder of the
Stockholders obligations under this Agreement will not to the knowledge of
the Stockholder: (i) conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation,
order, decree or judgment applicable to the Stockholder or by which its
properties are bound or affected; (ii) result in a violation of, or a default
under, or loss of any rights with respect to the Subject Shares under, or
conflict with, any contract, trust, commitment, agreement, understanding,
arrangement or restriction of any kind to which the Stockholder is a party or
by which the Stockholder may be bound or to which the Subject Shares are
subject which would materially impair the ability of the Stockholder to
perform hereunder, including, without limitation, the Charter (as defined in
the Merger Agreement); or (iii) result in or constitute a breach or default
under, or give any person or entity rights of termination, amendment
or acceleration in, any Lien (as defined in the Merger Agreement) applicable
to any of the Subject Shares.

(c) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. The Stockholder agrees that, until the
Expiration Date, the Stockholder shall ensure that other than as contemplated
hereby: (i) none of the Subject Shares is deposited into a voting trust and
(ii) no proxy is granted, and no voting agreement or similar agreement is
entered into, with respect to the Subject Shares.

(d) _No Proxy Solicitations, etc._ From the date of this Agreement until the
Expiration Date, the Stockholder, solely in its capacity as a stockholder of
the Company, will not: (i) solicit proxies with respect to (A) an approval of
any proposal made in opposition to or competition with consummation of the
Merger, (B) the adoption of any merger agreement or approval of any merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, reorganization or recapitalization with any
party other than with Parent or Parents affiliates (as defined in Rule 405
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) or (C) any liquidation or winding
up of the Company (each of the foregoing is hereinafter referred to as an "
_Opposing Proposal_ "); (ii) encourage or assist any party in taking or
planning any action that would compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to
interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement, including, without
limitation, encouraging, facilitating or participating in any tender offer or
exchange with respect to the Subject Shares; or (iii) initiate a stockholders
vote or action by consent of the Company stockholders with respect to an
Opposing Proposal 

(e) _Stockholder Capacity_. No person executing this Agreement (or an
affiliate thereof) who is or becomes prior to the Expiration Date a governor
of the Company makes any agreement or understanding herein in his or her
capacity as such governor or in any other capacity other than as a stockholder
of the Company. The Stockholder signs solely in his, her or its capacity as
the record and beneficial owner of the Subject Shares and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein this agreement is not intended to apply to any
activity that the Stockholder may otherwise conduct in the course of its
business operations unrelated to its status as a stockholder of the Company.

(f) _Additional Covenants and Documents_. The Stockholder hereby
covenants and agrees not to take any action prohibited by Section 5.2 of the
Merger Agreement.



 

-4- 1.7 _Consent and Waiver_. The Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the
terms of any agreements to which the Stockholder is a party as a stockholder
or pursuant to any rights the Stockholder may have as a stockholder, in each
case, solely with respect to the Subject Shares.



     | 2. | _Miscellaneous_. 
---|---|--- 

2.1 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or

shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

2.2 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations of the Stockholder may be assigned by
the Stockholder (other than to any affiliate of the Stockholder or any
affiliate of a parent company of the Stockholder, provided that such affiliate
specifically agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement)

that may be available to Parent upon any such violation, Parent shall have the
right to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific performance,
injunctive relief or by any other means available to Parent at law or in
equity. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Stockholder
agrees not to seek, and agree to waive any requirement for, the securing or
