require.

 



 

 **2.5** **_Circular_**

 



 

(a) Subject to the Purchaser complying with Section 2.5(d), the Company will,
in consultation with the Purchaser:

 



 

(i) as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
promptly prepare the Circular together with any other documents required by
the BCBCA, the U.S. Exchange Act or any other applicable Laws in connection
with the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by the Company Shareholders at
the Company Meeting; and

 



 

(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after the issuance of the Interim Order

respects with applicable Laws, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, that the Circular (including with respect to any information
incorporated therein by reference) will not contain any misrepresentation

Purchaser) and will provide the Company Shareholders with information in
sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the
matters to be placed before them at the Company Meeting.

 



 

(c) The Company and the Purchaser will cooperate in the preparation, filing
and mailing of the Circular. The Company will provide the Purchaser and legal
counsel to the Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on drafts of the Circular and other documents related thereto prior to filing
the Circular with applicable Governmental Authorities and printing and mailing
the Circular to the Company Shareholders and will give reasonable
consideration to such comments. All information relating solely to the
Purchaser included in the Circular shall be provided by the Purchaser in
accordance with Section 2.5(d) and shall be in form and content satisfactory
to the Purchaser, acting reasonably, and the Circular will include a copy of
the Fairness Opinion and a statement that the Company Special Committee has
unanimously determined and the Company Board has unanimously (other than an
abstention by a single director) determined that the Arrangement is fair to
the Company Shareholders, and it is in the best interests of the Company and
the unanimously (other than an abstention by a single director) recommendation
of the Company Board that the Company Shareholders vote in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution and the rationale for that recommendation and a
statement that each Director and Named Executive Officer of the Company
intends to vote all Company Shares held by him or her in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution.

information regarding the Purchaser as may reasonably be required to be
included in the Circular pursuant to applicable Laws and any other documents
related thereto.

 



 

(e) The Company and the Purchaser will each promptly notify the other if at
any time before the Effective Date it becomes aware (in the case of the
Company, only with respect to the Company and in the case of the Purchaser
only with respect to the Purchaser) that the Circular or any other document
referred to in Section 2.5(d) contains any misrepresentation or otherwise
requires any amendment or supplement and promptly deliver written notice to
the other Party setting out full particulars thereof. In any such event, the
Company and the Purchaser will cooperate with each other in the preparation,
filing and dissemination of any required supplement or amendment to the
Circular or such other document, as the case may be, and any related news
release or other document necessary or desirable in connection therewith.

 



 

(f) The Company shall keep the Purchaser fully informed in a timely manner of
any requests or comments made by the Canadian or U.S. securities regulatory

the Arrangement or serve any such material, and will not agree to modify or
amend materials so filed or served, except as contemplated by this Section 2.6
or with the Purchasers prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, however, that nothing
herein shall require the Purchaser to agree or consent to any increase or
change in the consideration payable under the terms of the Plan of Arrangement
or any modification or amendment to such filed or served materials that
expands or increases the Purchasers obligations set forth in any such filed
or served materials or under this Agreement or the Arrangement. In addition,
the Company will not object to legal counsel to the Purchaser making such
submissions on the hearing of the motion for the Interim Order and the
application for the Final Order as such counsel considers appropriate,
provided that the Company or its legal counsel is advised of the nature of any
submissions prior to the hearing and such submissions are consistent in all
material respects with the terms of this Agreement and the Plan of
Arrangement. The Company will also provide the Purchaser on a timely basis
with copies of any notice of appearance and evidence or other documents served
on the Company or its legal counsel in respect of the application for the
Interim Order or the Final Order or any appeal therefrom and of any notice,
whether or not in writing, received by the Company or its legal counsel
indicating any intention to oppose the granting of the Interim Order or the
Final Order or to appeal the Interim Order or the Final Order.

 



 

 **2.7** **_Dissent Rights_**

notice of any dissent or purported exercise by any Company Shareholder of
Dissent Rights, any withdrawal of such a notice, and any other instruments
served pursuant to Dissent Rights and received by the Company. The Company
shall not make any payment or settlement offer, or agree to any such
settlement, or conduct any negotiations prior to the Effective Time with

reasonably, shall have given its written consent.

 



 

 **2.8** **_List of Securityholders_**

 



 

Upon the reasonable request from time to time of the Purchaser, the Company
will promptly provide the Purchaser with lists (in electronic form) of the

Shares and lists of non-objecting beneficial owners of Company Shares and
participants in book-based nominee registers (such as CDS and Co., Cede and Co.
and the Depositary Trust Company), together with their addresses and
respective holdings of Company Shares. The Company will from time to time
require that its registrar and transfer agent furnish the Purchaser with such
additional information, including updated or additional lists of Company
Shareholders, Company Optionholders and holders of Company PSUs and Company
RSUs, information regarding beneficial ownership of Company Shares and lists
of holdings and other assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably request.

 



 

 **2.9** **_Securityholder Communications_**

 



 

The Company and the Purchaser agree to cooperate in the preparation of
presentations, if any, to any Company Shareholders or other securityholders of
the Company or the analyst community regarding the Arrangement, and the
Company agrees to consult with the Purchaser in connection with any formal
meeting with Company Shareholders or other securityholders of the Company or
analysts that it may have relating to the Arrangement, provided, however, that
the foregoing shall be subject to the Companys overriding obligation to make
any disclosure or filing required by applicable Laws or stock exchange rules
and if the Company is required to make any such disclosure, it shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon prior to its dissemination.

 



 

 **2.10** **_Company PSUs, Company RSUs and Cash Based Incentive Plan
Awards_**

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, pursuant to the
Arrangement, the vesting of all outstanding Company PSUs disclosed to the
Purchaser in Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter will be
accelerated. The holder will receive the target number of Company PSUs set out
in his or her award agreement and each Company PSU will be surrendered by the
holder for one Company Share less any applicable Tax, and the Company shall
take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to the
foregoing.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, pursuant to the
Arrangement, the vesting of all outstanding Company RSUs disclosed to the
Purchaser in Section 2.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter will be
accelerated and each Company RSU will be surrendered by the holder for one
Company Share less any applicable Tax, and the Company shall take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to the foregoing.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the retention awards granted under the Cash Based Incentive Plan set out
in Section 2.10(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter will paid in full on
the Effective Date; and

 



 

(ii) the vesting of all outstanding long term incentive awards and performance
incentive awards under the Cash Based Incentive Plan set out in Section
2.10(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter will be accelerated and paid in
full on the Effective Date,

 



      
 

 



 

in each case, less any applicable Tax, and the Company shall take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to the foregoing.

 



 

 **2.11** **_Payment of Consideration_**

 



 

The Purchaser will, following receipt by the Company of the Final Order and
Regulatory Approvals, ensure that on the Effective Date: (i) the Depositary
has been provided with sufficient Purchaser Shares in escrow to satisfy the
aggregate Share Consideration payable to Company Shareholders pursuant to the
Plan of Arrangement (such Share Consideration not to include payments to
Company Shareholders exercising Dissent Rights and who have not withdrawn
their notice of objection); and (ii) the trustees for each class of Company
Notes have received cash sufficient to satisfy the Purchasers obligations
under Section 4.11 with respect to the redemption of the Company Notes.

 



 

 **2.12** **_Withholding Taxes_**

 



 

The Company, the Purchaser and the Depositary will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Company Shareholder
or other securityholder of the Company under the Plan of Arrangement
(including any payment to Company Shareholders exercising Dissent Rights) such
amounts as the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of any
provincial, state, local or foreign Tax Law as counsel may advise is required
to be so deducted and withheld by the Company, the Purchaser or the
Depositary, as the case may be. For the purposes hereof, all such withheld
amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made on account of the obligation to make
payment to such person hereunder, and such deducted or withheld amounts shall
be remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority in the time and manner
required by the applicable Law by or on behalf of the Company, the Purchaser
or the Depositary, as the case may be. To the extent necessary, such
deductions and withholdings may be effected by selling any Company Shares to
which any such person may otherwise be entitled under the Plan of Arrangement,
and any amount remaining following the sale, deduction and remittance shall be
paid to the person entitled thereto as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



 

 **2.13** **_U.S. Securities Law Matters_**

 



 

The Parties agree that the Arrangement will be carried out with the intention
that all the Share Consideration issued on completion of the Arrangement will
be issued by the Purchaser in reliance on the exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10)
thereunder and pursuant to exemptions from applicable state securities laws or
in compliance with applicable state registration requirements. In order to
ensure the availability of the exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S.
Securities Act and to facilitate the Purchasers compliance with other United
States securities Laws, the Parties agree that the Arrangement will be carried
out on the following basis:

 



 

(a) the Arrangement will be subject to the approval of the Court;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) the Court will be advised as to the intention of the Parties to rely on
the exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act prior to the
hearing required to issue the Interim Order;

 



 

(c) prior to the issuance of the Interim Order, the Company will file with the
Court a copy of the proposed text of the Circular together with any other
documents required by Law in connection with the Company Meeting;

 



 

(d) the Court will be required to satisfy itself as to the substantive and
procedural fairness of the Arrangement to the Company Shareholders, subject to
the Arrangement;

 



 

(e) the Company will ensure that each Company Shareholder will be given
adequate notice advising them of their right to attend the hearing of the
Court to give approval of the Arrangement and providing them with sufficient
information necessary for them to exercise that right;

 



 

(f) the Company Shareholders entitled to receive Share Consideration will be
advised that the Share Consideration issued pursuant to the Arrangement have
not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and will be issued by
Purchaser in reliance on the exemption from registration provided under
Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act;

 



 

(g) the Final Order approving the Arrangement that is obtained from the Court
will expressly state that the Arrangement is approved by the Court as being
substantially and procedurally fair to the Company Shareholders;

 



 

(h) the Interim Order approving the Company Meeting will specify that each
Company Shareholder will have the right to appear before the Court at the
hearing of the Court to give approval of the Arrangement so long as they enter
an appearance within a reasonable time and in accordance with the requirements
of Section 3(a)(10) under the U.S. Securities Act; and

 



 

(i) the Final Order shall include a statement to substantially the following
effect:

 



 

"This Order will serve as a basis of a claim to an exemption, pursuant to
Section 3(a)(10) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from
the registration requirements otherwise imposed by that act, regarding the
distribution of securities of the Purchaser pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement."

 



 

 **2.14** **_U.S. Tax Matters_**

 



 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the exchange of Company Shares for the
Share Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties
to this Agreement adopt this Agreement and the Arrangement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations.

Redemption Documents shall be subject to the prior review of, and comment by,
the Company and its legal counsel, and shall be reasonably acceptable to them.
The Company shall cause its officers and directors to execute and deliver such
officers certificates and other customary items required by the Purchaser in
connection with its preparation of the Redemption Documents, including
officers certificates supporting the opinions of counsel contemplated above.

 



 

(b) At the time of closing as contemplated in Section 2.1, the Purchaser and
one or more of its subsidiaries shall contribute to the Company by way of non-
interest bearing loan in order for the Company to pay or, to the extent the
Company has immediately available funds at such time, the Company shall pay,
the amount of cash necessary to redeem or otherwise satisfy and discharge each
of the outstanding Company Notes, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account or accounts designated pursuant to the Redemption
Documents, provided however that the proceeds of any such loan or contribution
will be held in escrow pursuant to escrow arrangements satisfactory to the
Purchaser, the Company and the applicable note trustee and such proceeds will
be released on such date (without further action of the parties) upon the
completion of the steps set forth in Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

(c) Provided that the Purchaser shall have provided the Company with the
Redemption Documents, the Company shall: (i) deliver fully executed Redemption
Documents on a date specified by the Purchaser on or prior to the Effective
Date and take any and all actions, including at such times and on such dates,
as deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate by the Purchaser to be taken by
the Company and as are in accordance with the terms

 



      
 

 



 

of the Company Note Indentures to issue redemption notices and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee under each of the Company Note
Indentures to provide written acknowledgement of the satisfaction and
discharge referred to above; and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the trustee under each of the Company Note Indentures to agree to proceed with
the redemption of the Company 2017 Notes, the Company 2018 Notes or the
Company 2019 Notes outstanding thereunder, and, in any event, take any such
action as is reasonably necessary to cause each such Trustee to mail the
notices of redemption to the holders of the applicable Company Notes.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.11 to the contrary, (i) it is
understood and agreed that any redemption notice in respect of any of the
Company Notes shall be delivered in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Notes Indenture and any such redemption notice delivered
prior to the Effective Date shall be expressly conditioned on the occurrence
of the Effective Date and (ii) the refusal by any trustee under any of the
Company Note Indentures to permit an amendment or cancellation of any
previously issued redemption notice or to permit the issuance or any new
redemption notice replacing a previously issued redemption notice shall not
constitute a breach of this Section 4.11.

 



 

 **4.12** **_Negotiations with Respect to Notes_**

 



 

If on or after October 1, 2016, the Company reasonably believes that the
Arrangement may not be completed, the Company will be permitted to discuss and
negotiate draft documentation relating to a restructuring transaction
("Restructuring Transaction") involving the Company and the Company
Noteholders, and which may include the amendment of the terms of the Companys
debt and equity securities, the conversion of debt securities to equity
securities and a change of control of the Company provided that the Purchaser
shall be informed of the Companys decision to proceed with such discussions
and kept reasonably informed by the Company of the occurrence, status and
nature of such discussions and negotiations, and no agreement that may be
reached through such discussions and negotiations shall become effective until
after this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. The Parties
further agree that such discussions and negotiations, and the payment of fees
to the Companys advisors and advisors acting on behalf of the Company
Noteholders in such negotiations shall be considered to occur in the ordinary
course for the purposes of Section 4.1(a) and shall not constitute a breach of
the Companys covenants under Sections 5.1(a)(i), 5.1(a)(ii) and 5.1(b).

 



 

 **4.13** **_Pre-Acquisition Reorganization_**

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 4.13(b), the Company agrees that, upon request of the
Purchaser, the Company shall: (i) perform such reorganizations of its
corporate structure, capital structure, business, operations and assets or
such other transactions as the Purchaser may request, acting reasonably (each
a " **Pre-Acquisition Reorganization** "); and (ii) cooperate with the
Purchaser and its advisors to determine the nature of the Pre-Acquisition
Reorganizations that might be undertaken and the manner in which they would
most effectively be undertaken.

 



 

(b) The Company will not be obligated to participate in any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization under Section 4.13(a) unless such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) can be completed prior to the Effective Date, and can be unwound in the
event the Arrangement is not consummated without adversely affecting the
Company in any material manner; and

 



 

(ii) does not impair the ability of the Company to consummate, and will not
materially delay the consummation of, the Arrangement.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser must provide written notice to the Company of any proposed
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least 10 Business Days prior to the
Effective Date. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company and the Purchaser
shall work cooperatively and use their best efforts to prepare prior to the
Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and things
as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization,
including any amendment to this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement and shall
seek to have any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization made effective as of the
last moment of the Business Day ending immediately prior to the Effective
Date.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser agrees that it will be responsible for all costs and
expenses associated with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization to be carried out
at its request and shall indemnify and save harmless the Company and its
affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest awards, judgements and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization if after participating in any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization the Arrangement is not completed other than due to a breach by
the Company of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **4.14** **_TSX Delisting and OTCQX Removal_**

 



 

The Purchaser and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Company Shares to be de-listed from the TSX and quotations
removed from the OTCQX promptly following the Effective Time, with effect as
soon as practicable following the acquisition by the Purchaser of the Company
Shares pursuant to the Arrangement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 _ 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

 **5.1** **_Acquisition Proposals_**

 



 

(a) Except permitted in this Article 5, from and after the date of this
Agreement and until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on

its subsidiaries shall not, directly or indirectly, through any of their
Representatives or otherwise, and shall not permit any such person to:

 



 

(i) make, initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing or
affording access to information or any site visit), or otherwise take any
other action that facilitates, directly or indirectly, any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal;

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) enter into or otherwise engage or participate in any discussions or

(iii) take no position or remain neutral with respect to, or agree to, accept,
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to agree to accept,
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood
that publicly taking no position or a neutral position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal for a period exceeding five Business Days after such
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced shall be deemed to constitute
a violation of this Section 5.1(a)(iii)), provided the Company Board has
rejected such Acquisition Proposal and affirmed its recommendation to all
Company Shareholders that they vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution
before the end of such five Business Day period (or in the event that the
Company Meeting is scheduled to occur within such five Business Day period,
prior to the third Business Day prior to the date of the Company Meeting); or

 



 

(iv) make or propose publicly to make a Change of Recommendation;

 



 

(v) accept, enter into, or propose publicly to accept or enter into, any
agreement, understanding or arrangement effecting or related to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted by and in accordance with
Section 5.1(e)); or

 



 

(vi) make any public announcement or take any other action inconsistent with
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Company
Board of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Representatives will, and will cause its subsidiaries
and their Representatives, to immediately cease and terminate, and cause to be
terminated, any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiations with
any person (other than the Purchaser and its Representatives) with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith,
the Company will: (i) immediately discontinue access of any such person to any
confidential information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries,
including access to any data room, virtual or otherwise; and (ii) within two
Business Days after the date hereof, to the extent such information has not
previously been returned or destroyed, promptly request, and exercise all
rights it has to require, the return or destruction of all copies of any
confidential information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries provided
to any person other than the Purchaser and its Representatives and the return
or destruction of all material including or incorporating or otherwise
reflecting such confidential information regarding the Company or its
subsidiaries, using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such
requests are fully complied with in accordance with the terms of such rights.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Company represents and warrants that since January 1, 2015, neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has waived any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement or restriction to which the Company or any
subsidiary is a party and further covenants and agrees: (i) not to release (or
allow any of its subsidiaries to release) any person from, grant any
permission under or terminate, modify, amend or waive the terms of, any
confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement or standstill or similar
provisions in any such confidentiality agreement (it being acknowledged and
agreed that the automatic termination of any standstill provisions of any such
agreement as the result of the entering into and announcement of this
Agreement shall not be a violation of this Section 5.1(c)); and (ii) the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to, take all necessary
action to enforce each confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement or
restriction to which the Company or any subsidiary is a party.

 



 

(d) The Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify the
Purchaser, at first orally and thereafter in writing, of any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not in writing), any inquiry, proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and any
request received by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives for non-public information relating to the Company (or any of
its subsidiaries) or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company (or any of its subsidiaries) by any person in connection with, or that
could reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, including
a copy of the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request a
description of its material terms and conditions and the identity of all
persons making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request,
copies of all written documents, correspondences and other materials received
in respect of, from or on behalf of any such persons, and promptly provide to
the Purchaser such other information concerning such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, proposal, offer or request as the Purchaser may reasonably request.
The Company will keep the Purchaser promptly and fully informed of the status
and details (including all amendments, changes or other modifications) of any
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request and will
provide to the Purchaser copies of all materials or substantive correspondence
if in writing or electronic form, and if not in writing or electronic form, a
description of the material terms of such correspondence sent or communicated
to or by the Company by or on behalf of or to any persons making any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.1(a), in
the event that the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
from any person after the date hereof and prior to the Company Meeting that
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.1, and subject to the
Companys compliance with Section 5.1(d), the Company and its Representatives
may (i) contact such person solely to clarify the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish information with respect to it to such
person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (iii)
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition
Proposal, if and only if:

 



 

(i) prior to taking any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) above, the
Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) such person was not restricted from making such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to an existing confidentiality agreement, standstill, use, business
purpose or similar restriction with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Representatives;

 



 

(iii) the Company has been, and continues to be, in compliance with its
obligations under this Article 5; and

 



 

(iv) prior to or concurrently with providing any such copies, access, or
disclosure, (A) the Company enters into and provides a copy of an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to the Purchaser promptly (and in any event within
24 hours thereafter) upon its execution and (B) the Company contemporaneously
provides to the Purchaser any non-public information concerning the Company
that is provided to such person which was not previously provided to the
Purchaser or its Representatives.

 



 

(f) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.1, neither the Company
Board, nor any committee thereof will permit the Company to accept or enter
into any Acquisition Agreement requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Arrangement or providing for the payment of any break,
termination or other fees or expenses to any person proposing an Acquisition
Proposal in the event that the Company completes the transactions contemplated
hereby or any other transaction with the Purchaser or any of its affiliates.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding Section 5.1(f), in the event the Company receives a _bona
fide_ Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal from any person after
the date hereof and prior to the Company Meeting, then the Company Board may,
prior to the Company Meeting, withdraw, modify, qualify or change in a manner
adverse to the Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Arrangement
and/or approve or recommend such Superior Proposal and/or enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if and only if:

 



 

(i) the person making the Superior Proposal was not restricted from making
such Superior Proposal pursuant to an existing confidentiality, standstill,
use, business purpose or similar restriction with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (it being acknowledged and agreed that the automatic termination
of any standstill provisions as the result of the entering into and
announcement of this Agreement shall not be a violation of this Section
5.1(g));

 



 

(ii) the Company did not breach any provision of this Section 5.1 in
connection with the preparation or making of such Acquisition Proposal and the
Company has been and continues to be in compliance with this Section 5.1;

 



 

(iii) the Company has given written notice to the Purchaser that it has
received such Superior Proposal and that the Company Board has determined that
(x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the
Company Board intends to withdraw, modify, qualify or change in a manner
adverse to the Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Arrangement

 



      
 

 



 

(including the recommendation that the Company Shareholders vote in favour of
the Arrangement Resolution), and/or enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case, promptly following the making
of such determination, together with written notice from the Company Board
regarding the value and financial terms that the Company Board, in
consultation with its financial advisors, has determined should be ascribed to
any non-cash consideration offered under any such Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iv) the Company has provided the Purchaser a copy of the proposed Acquisition
Agreement and all supporting materials, including any financing documents
supplied to the Company in connection therewith;

 



 

(v) a period of at least five full Business Days (such period being the "
**Superior Proposal Notice Period** ") shall have elapsed from the later of
the date the Purchaser received the notice from the Company referred to in
Section 5.1(g)(iii) and the date on which the Purchaser received the materials
set out in Section 5.1(g)(iv);

 



 

(vi) during any Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Purchaser has had the
opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement in order for such Acquisition Proposal to cease
to be a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(vii) after the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
determined, in accordance with Section 5.1(h),that such Acquisition Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal compared to the Arrangement as proposed to be
amended by the Purchaser and that the failure by the Company Board to
recommend that the Company enter into the Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;

 



 

(viii) the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(i); and

 



 

(ix) the Company has previously, or concurrently will have, paid to the
Purchaser the Termination Fee.

 



 

(h) During the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company Board will review
in good faith any offer made by the Purchaser to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement in order to determine, in consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, whether the proposed amendments
would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition Proposal previously
constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. The
Company agrees that, subject to the Companys disclosure obligations under
applicable Securities Laws, the fact of the making of, and each of the terms
of, any such proposed amendments shall be kept strictly confidential and shall
not be disclosed to any person (including without limitation, the person
having made the Superior Proposal), other than the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives, without the Purchasers prior written consent. If the Company
Board determines that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior
Proposal as a result of the amendments proposed by the Purchaser, the Company
will forthwith so advise the Purchaser and will promptly thereafter accept the
offer by the Purchaser to amend the terms of this Agreement, and the
Arrangement and the Parties agree to take such actions and execute such
documents as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing. If the Company
Board continues to believe in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects the Purchasers offer to
amend this Agreement and the Arrangement, if any, the Company may, subject to
compliance with the other provisions hereof, terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.1(d)(i) to enter into an Acquisition Agreement in
respect of such Superior Proposal.

 



 

(i) Each successive modification of any Superior Proposal shall constitute a
new Superior Proposal for the purposes of Section 5.1(h) and shall require a
new five full Business Day Superior Proposal Notice Period from the later of
the date on which the Purchaser received the notice from the Company referred
to in Section 5.1(g)(iii) and the date on which the Purchaser received the
materials set out in Section 5.1(g)(iv). If the Company Meeting is scheduled
to occur during a Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company shall, upon the
request of the Purchaser, adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to a date
specified by the Purchaser that is not later than ten Business Days after the
date on which the Company Meeting was originally scheduled to be held.

 



 

(j) The Company Board shall reaffirm its recommendation in favour of the
Arrangement by news release promptly after (A) the Company Board has
determined that any Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal if the
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or made; or (B) the Company
Board makes the determination referred to in Section 5.1(h) that an
Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly announced or made and which
previously constituted a Superior Proposal has ceased to be a Superior
Proposal. The Company shall provide the Purchaser and its outside legal
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form and content
of any such news release and shall give reasonable consideration to all
amendments to such press release requested by the Purchaser and its counsel.
Such news release shall state that the Company Board has determined that such
Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(k) The Company and/or any of its subsidiaries will not become a party to any
Contract with any person subsequent to the date hereof that limits or
prohibits the Company from (i) providing or making available to the Purchaser
and its affiliates and Representatives any information provided or made
available to such person or its officers, directors, employees, consultants,
advisors, agents or other representatives (including solicitors, accountants,
investment bankers and financial advisors) pursuant to any confidentiality
agreement described in this Section 5.1 or (ii) providing the Purchaser and
its affiliates and Representatives with any other information required to be
given to it by the Company under this Section 5.1.

 



 

(l) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Section 5.1:

 



 

(i) the Company Board shall have the right to respond, within the time and in
the manner required by applicable Securities Laws, to any take-over bid or

 



      
 

 



 

tender or exchange offer made for the Company Shares that it determines is not
a Superior Proposal, provided that the Purchaser and its counsel shall be
provided with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
response and the Company Board shall give reasonable consideration to such
comments; and

 



 

(ii) prior to the Company Meeting, the Company and the Company Board shall not
be prohibited from making any disclosure to Company Shareholders if: (A) a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence, circumstance or
development that would reasonably be expected to be a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect has occurred and is continuing; and (b) the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Law, provided that
this Section 5.1(l)(ii) shall not permit the Company Board to make a Change of
Recommendation.

 



 

(m) The Company shall ensure that its subsidiaries and the Company and its
subsidiaries respective Representatives are aware of the provisions of this
Section 5.1, and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Article 5
by the Companys Representatives, the Companys subsidiaries and/or the
Companys subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed a breach of this
Article 5 by the Company.

 



 

 **5.2** **_Termination Fee and Expenses_**

 



 

(a) " **Termination Fee Event** " means any of the following events:

 



 

(i) this Agreement shall have been terminated by the Company or the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(i) _[Occurrence of Outside Date]_ or Section
6.1(b)(ii) _[Arrangement Resolution Not Approved]_ , and:

 



 

(A) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is made or publicly
announced or otherwise publicly disclosed by any person (other than the
Purchaser or any of its affiliates) or any person (other than the Purchaser or
any of its affiliates) shall have publicly announced an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal; and

 



 

(B) within 365 days following the date of such termination (I) an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (A) above) is consummated or (II) the Company
or one or more of its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, in one or more
transactions, enters into a contract in respect of an Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (A) above) and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated at any time thereafter,

 



      
 

 



 

provided, however, that for the purposes of this paragraph 5.2(a)(i) all
references to "20% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be
changed to "50% or more";

 



 

(ii) this Agreement shall have been terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(i) _[Change of Recommendation]_ ;

 



 

(iii) this Agreement shall have been terminated by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(ii) _[Breach of Non-Solicitation Covenants]_ ;

 



 

(iv) this Agreement shall have been terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.1(d)(i) _[Superior Proposal]_ ; or

 



 

(v) this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to any Subsection of
Section 6.1 if at such time the Purchaser is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to (A) Section 6.1(c)(i) _[Change of Recommendation]_ or
(B) Section 6.1(c)(ii) _[Breach of Non-Solicitation Covenants]_ and so long as
the Purchaser has notified the Company of the Purchasers right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i) or Section 6.1(c)(ii), as the
case may be, within five Business Days of the Purchaser becoming aware of the
action or event underlying the Purchasers right to terminate _._

 



 

(b) If a Termination Fee Event occurs, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser
a termination fee of $35 million (the " **Termination Fee** ") by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the
Purchaser. The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to the Purchaser on or
prior to the earlier of completion of or entry into an Acquisition Agreement
in respect of applicable Acquisition Proposal (in the case of a Termination
Fee Event referred to in Section 5.2(a)(i)), within one Business Day following
termination of this Agreement (in the case of a Termination Fee Event referred
to in Section 5.2(a)(ii), or prior to or concurrent with termination of this
Agreement (in the case of a Termination Fee Event referred to in Section
5.2(a)(iv)). If the Company does not have sufficient financial resources to
pay the Termination Fee, then it shall be a condition of (i) any Superior
Proposal referred to in Section 6.1(d)(i), and (i) any share or asset
acquisition referred to in Section 5.2(a)(i) where the Company has entered
into any agreement to support such share acquisition or to transfer such
assets, as applicable, that the person making such Superior Proposal or
acquisition, as applicable, shall advance or otherwise provide to the Company
the cash required for the Company to pay the Termination Fee, which amount
shall be so advanced or provided prior to the date on which the Company is
required to pay the Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) Each Party will pay its respective legal and accounting costs, fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement and all documents and instruments executed pursuant to this
Agreement and any other costs, fees and expenses whatsoever and howsoever
incurred, and will indemnify and save harmless the others from and against any
claim for any brokers, finders or placement fee or commission alleged to
have been incurred as a result of any action by it in connection with the
transactions hereunder. The Purchaser shall pay all filing fees payable in
connection with the Key Regulatory Approvals.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Section 5.2 are payments in consideration for the disposition of the
Purchasers rights under this Agreement and represent liquidated damages which
are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Purchaser will suffer or
incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant
termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. The Company irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the
Parties agree that the payment of an amount pursuant to this Section 5.2 in
the manner provided herein is the sole and exclusive remedy the Purchaser in
respect of the event giving rise to such payment, provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 5.2, and no payment of any such amount,
shall relieve or have the effect of relieving the Company in any way from
liability for damages incurred or suffered by the Purchaser as a result of an
intentional or wilful breach of this Agreement, including the intentional or
wilful making of a misrepresentation in this Agreement and nothing contained
in this Section 5.2 shall preclude the Company from seeking injunctive relief
in accordance with Section 8.14 to restrain the breach or threatened breach of
the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentialit
**y** Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of such
acts, covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting a bond or
security in connection therewith.

that the Company Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution by
the fifth Business Day following receipt of a request by the Purchaser to do

obligations or material covenants set forth in Section 5.1;

 



 

(iii) subject to compliance with Section 6.3, the Company breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 or Section 7.3 not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being
cured or is not cured in accordance with the terms of Section 6.3,

 



      
 

 



 

provided, however, that the Purchaser is not then in breach of this Agreement
so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2
not to be satisfied; or

 



 

(iv) a Company Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence, circumstance
or development that could reasonably be expected to be a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred and is continuing.

 



 

(d) _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company:

 



 

(i) at any time prior to the approval of the Arrangement Resolution, if the
Company Board approves and authorizes the Company to enter into, a definitive
agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal in
accordance with Section 5.1(g), subject to the Company complying with the
terms of Section 5.1 and paying the Termination Fee;

 



 

(ii) at any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to compliance with
Section 6.3, if the Purchaser breaches any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause
any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not to be
satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured or is not cured in
accordance with the terms of Section 6.3, provided, however, that the Company
is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not to be satisfied; or

 



 

(iii) a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence,
circumstance or development that could reasonably be expected to be a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect has occurred and is continuing.

 



 

 **6.2** **_Void upon Termination_**

 



 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no force and effect and no Party will have any liability or
further obligation to the other Party hereunder, except that the provisions of
this Section 6.2, Section 4.3, Section 5.2 and Article 8 (other than Section
8.6 and Section 8.9) shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section
6.1, provided, however, that neither the termination of this Agreement nor
anything contained in Section 5.2 or this Section 6.2 will relieve any Party
from any liability for any intentional or wilful breach by it of this
Agreement, including any intentional or wilful making of a misrepresentation
in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 6.1.

 



 

 **6.3** **_Notice and Cure Provisions_**

 



 

If any Party determines at any time prior to the Effective Time that it
intends to refuse to complete the transactions contemplated hereby because of
any unfilled or unperformed condition contained in this Agreement, such Party
will so notify the other Party forthwith upon

 



       
 

 



 

making such determination in order that the other Party will have the right
and opportunity to take such steps, at its own expense, as may be necessary
for the purpose of fulfilling or performing such condition within a reasonable
period of time, but in no event later than the Outside Date. Neither the
Company nor the Purchaser may elect not to complete the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions precedent contained in Article
7 hereof or exercise any termination right arising therefrom and no payments
will be payable as a result of such election pursuant to Article 7 unless
forthwith and in any event prior to the Effective Time the Party intending to
rely thereon has given a written notice to the other Party specifying in
reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties or
other matters which the Party giving such notice is asserting as the basis for
the non-fulfillment of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of
the termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is given,
provided that the other Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if
such matter is susceptible to being cured, the Party giving such notice may
not terminate this Agreement as a result thereof until the earlier of the
Outside Date and the expiration of a period of 30 Business Days from such
notice. If such notice has been given prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, such meeting, unless the Parties otherwise agree, will be postponed
or adjourned until the expiry of such period (without causing any breach of
any other provision contained herein).

 **8.2** **_Assignment_**

 



 

The Company agrees that the Purchaser may assign all or any part of its rights
under this Agreement to, and its obligations under this Agreement may be
assumed by, a wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the Purchaser,
provided that the Purchaser shall continue to be liable jointly and severally
with such subsidiary for all obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party.

 



 

 **8.3** **_Benefit of Agreement_**

 



 

This Agreement will enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective
successors (including any successor by reason of amalgamation or statutory
arrangement) and permitted assigns of the Parties.

 



 

 **8.4** **_Third Party Beneficiaries_**

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.9(a) which, without limiting its terms, is
intended as stipulations for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, the
Parties intend that this Agreement will not benefit or create any right or
cause of action in favour of any person, other than the Parties and that no
person, other than the Parties, shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of
this Agreement in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or other forum.

 



 

(b) Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of the Indemnified
Parties their direct rights against the applicable Party under Section 4.9(a),
which are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives, and
for such purpose, the Company confirms that it is acting as trustee on their
behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their behalf. The Parties
reserve their right to vary or rescind the rights at any time and in any way
whatsoever, if any, granted by or under this Agreement to any Person who is
not a Party, without notice to or consent of that Person, including any
Indemnified Person.

 



 

 **8.5** **_Time of Essence_**

 



 

Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.6** **_Public Announcements_**

 



 

No Party shall issue any press release or otherwise make written public
statements with respect to the Arrangement or this Agreement without the
consent of the other Party (which

 



      
 

 



 

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Company shall not make any filing with any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Arrangement or the transactions contemplated hereby without prior
consultation with the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall not make any filing
with any Governmental Authority with respect to the Arrangement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without prior consultation with the Company,
provided, however, that the foregoing shall be subject to each Partys
overriding obligation to make any disclosure or filing required under
applicable Laws, and the Party making the disclosure shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to give prior oral or written notice to the other Party and
reasonable opportunity for the other Party to review or comment on the
disclosure or filing (other than with respect to confidential information
contained in such disclosure or filing), and if such prior notice is not
possible, to give notice immediately following the making of any such
disclosure or filing, and provided further, however, that, except as otherwise
required by Section 5.1, the Company shall have no obligation to obtain the
consent of or consult with the Purchaser prior to any press release, public
statement, disclosure or filing by the Company with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal or a Change of Recommendation. The Parties acknowledge that the
Company and the Purchaser shall each file this Agreement under such Partys
profile on SEDAR (and in the case of the Company, on EDGAR) without any
further notice to any of them.

 



 

 **8.7** **_Governing Law; Attornment_**

 



 

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement or the Arrangement
and waives, to the fullest extent possible, the defence of an inconvenient
forum or any similar defence to the maintenance of proceedings in such courts.

 



 

 **8.8** **_Entire Agreement_**

 



 

This Agreement constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
thereof. There are no representations, warranties, terms, conditions,
undertakings or collateral agreements, express, implied or statutory, between
the Parties with respect thereto except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 **8.9** **_Amendment_**

 



 

This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, may, at any time and from time to
time before or after the holding of the Company Meeting but not later than the
Effective Time, be amended by written agreement of the Parties without,
subject to applicable Laws, further notice to or authorization on the part of
the Company Shareholders, and any such amendment may, without limitation:

 



 

(a) change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
Parties;

 



 

(b) change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
Parties;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation, term or provision
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

 



 

(d) waive compliance with or modify any of the conditions precedent referred
to in Article 7 or any of the covenants herein contained or waive or modify
performance of any of the obligations of the Parties,

 



 

provided, however, that no such amendment may reduce or materially affect the
consideration to be received by the Company Shareholders under the Arrangement
without their approval at the Company Meeting or, following the Company
Meeting, without their approval given in the same manner as required by
applicable Laws for the approval of the Arrangement as may be required by the
Court.

 



 

 **8.10** **_Waiver and Modifications_**

 



 

Any Party may (a) waive, in whole or in part, any inaccuracy of, or consent to
the modification of, any representation or warranty made to it hereunder or in
any document to be delivered pursuant hereto, (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Parties (c) waive
or consent to the modification of any of the covenants herein contained for
its benefit or waive or consent to the modification of any of the obligations
of the other Parties hereto or (d) waive the fulfillment of any condition to
its own obligations contained herein. No waiver or consent to the
modifications of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be effective or
binding unless made in writing and signed by the Party or Parties purporting
to give the same and, unless otherwise provided, will be limited to the
specific breach or condition waived. The rights and remedies of the Parties
hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity or otherwise. No
single or partial exercise by a Party of any right or remedy precludes or
otherwise affects any further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise
of any other right or remedy to which that Party may be entitled. No waiver or
partial waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, will be deemed or
construed a continued waiver of any condition or breach of any other term,
representation or warranty in this Agreement.

 



 

 **8.11** **_Severability_**

 



 

If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed
from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated herein is not affected in any material manner or would prevent or
significantly impede or materially delay the completion of the Arrangement.

 



 

 **8.12** **_Mutual Interest_**

 



 

Notwithstanding the fact that any part of this Agreement has been drafted or
prepared by or on behalf of one of the Parties, all Parties confirm that they
and their respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated this Agreement and
that the Parties have adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and
understanding of the Parties, and the language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent, and the Parties waive the application of any Laws or rules of
construction providing that

 



      
 

 



 

ambiguities in any agreement or other document will be construed against the
Party drafting such agreement or other document and agree that no rule of
construction providing that a provision is to be interpreted in favour of the
person who contracted the obligation and against the person who stipulated it
will be applied against any Party.

 



 

 **8.13** **_Further Assurances_**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, from time to
time, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all such further
documents and instruments, as the other Parties may, either before or after
the Effective Date, reasonably require to effectively carry out or better
evidence or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement and, in the
event the Arrangement becomes effective, to document or evidence any of the
transactions or events set out in the Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

 **8.14** **_Injunctive Relief_**

 



 

Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which a Party may be entitled at law or in
equity.

 



 

 **8.15** **_No Personal Liability_**

 



 

(a) No director, officer or employee of the Purchaser will have any personal
liability to the Company under this Agreement or any other document delivered
in connection with this Agreement or the Arrangement on behalf of the
Purchaser.

 



 

(b) No director, officer or employee of the Company will have any personal
liability to the Purchaser under this Agreement or any other document
delivered in connection with this Agreement or the Arrangement on behalf of
the Company.

 



 

 **8.16** **_Counterparts_**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts
(including by facsimile or electronic transmission), each of which will be
deemed to be an original and all of which taken together will be deemed to
constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

 _[Remainder of page has been left intentionally blank]_

 



      
 

 



 

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF** the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed
as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized.

This Plan of Arrangement is made pursuant to, is subject to the provisions of,
and forms a part of the Arrangement Agreement, except in respect of the
sequence of the steps comprising the Arrangement, which shall occur in the
order set forth herein.

 



 

 **2.2** **Binding Effect**

 



 

This Plan of Arrangement will become effective at the Effective Time and shall
be binding upon the Purchaser, Purchaser Holdco, the Company, the Company
Shareholders (including, for greater certainty, Dissenting Company
Shareholders), the Company Optionholders and the holders of Company PSUs and
Company RSUs, the Depositary and the Registrar and Transfer Agent in respect
of the Company Shares, including, as applicable, registered and beneficial
holders.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.3** **The Arrangement**

 



 

Commencing at the Effective Time, each of the events set out below shall occur
and be deemed to occur in the following sequence effective as at one minute
intervals starting at the Effective Time, in each case without any further
authorization, act or formality of or by the Court, the Registrar, the
Company, the Purchaser or any other person:

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time the following actions shall occur in the following
order:

 



 

(i) notwithstanding the terms of the Long Term Incentive Plan, each Company
Option will be exchanged for an option (each a, " **Purchaser Replacement
Option** ") to purchase from the Purchaser the number of Purchaser Shares
equal to: (A) 0.0988, _multiplied by_ (B) the number of Company Shares subject
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (and when
aggregated with the other Purchaser Replacement Options of a holder results in
a fraction of a Purchaser Share, they shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number of Purchaser Shares). Such Purchaser Replacement Option shall
provide for an exercise price per Purchaser Share equal to (Y) the exercise
price per Company Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided by_ (Z) 0.0988. All terms
and conditions of a Purchaser Replacement Option, including the term to
expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as the
Company Option for which it was exchanged, and shall be governed by the terms
of the Long Term Incentive Plan and any document evidencing a Company Option
shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such Purchaser Replacement
Option. It is intended that subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act apply to such
exchange of Company Options. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the foregoing,
if required, the exercise price of a Purchaser Replacement Option will be
increased such that the aggregate In-The-Money-Amount of the Purchaser
Replacement Option does not exceed the In-The-Money-Amount of the Company
Option immediately before the exchange contemplated in this Section 2.3(a)(i);

 



 

(ii) the vesting of each Company PSU will be accelerated and the holder will
receive the number of Company PSUs assuming target performance as set out in
his or her agreement; each Company PSU will be surrendered by the Company PSU
holder for one Company Share less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.4
and the Company Shares issuable in connection therewith will be deemed to be
issued to such Company PSU holder as fully paid and non-assessable common
shares in the authorized share structure of Company provided that no share
certificates shall be issued with respect to such shares;

 



 

(iii) the vesting of each Company RSU will be accelerated and each Company RSU
will be surrendered by the Company RSU holder for one Company Share less any
amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.4 and the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Shares issuable in connection therewith will be deemed to be issued to such
Company RSU holder as fully paid and non-assessable common shares in the
authorized share structure of Company provided that no share certificates
shall be issued with respect to such shares.

 



 

(b) Following the steps in Section 2.3(a):

 



 

(i) each Company Share held by a Dissenting Company Shareholder shall be
deemed to be transferred by the holder thereof, without any further act or
formality on its part, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances,
to the Company and the Company shall thereupon be obliged to pay the amount
therefor determined and payable in accordance with Article 3, and the name of
such holder shall be removed from the central securities register of the
Company as a holder of Company Shares and the Company Shares so transferred
will be cancelled;

 



 

(ii) each issued Company Share held by a Former Company Shareholder (other
than a Dissenting Company Shareholder or the Purchaser or any subsidiary of
the Purchaser but including, for greater certainty, any Company Shares issued
pursuant to Sections 2.3(a)(ii) and 2.3(a)(iii)) shall be transferred to the
Purchaser in exchange for the Share Consideration, subject to Article 4\.
Following completion of this step, the Purchaser will be the holder of all of
the issued and outstanding Company Shares; and

 



 

(iii) all Company Shares, each of which is now held by the Purchaser, will be
contributed by the Purchaser to Purchaser Holdco in consideration for a
corresponding number of common shares in the capital of Purchaser Holdco.
Following completion of this step, Purchaser Holdco will be the holder of all
of the issued and outstanding Company Shares and the central securities
register of the Company will be revised accordingly.

 



 

The exchanges and cancellations provided for in this Section 2.3 will be
deemed to occur on the Effective Date, notwithstanding that certain of the
procedures related thereto are not completed until after the Effective Date.

 



 

 **2.4** **Delivery of Consideration**

 



 

(a) Following the receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date,
the Purchaser shall deliver or arrange to be delivered to the Depositary the
aggregate Consideration in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3(b),
which Consideration shall be held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for
such Former Company Shareholders for distribution to such Former Company
Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 4, and upon return of a properly
completed Company Share Letter of Transmittal by a registered Former Company
Shareholder together with certificates representing Company Shares and such
other documents as the Depositary may

 



      
 

 



 

require, Former Company Shareholders shall be entitled to receive delivery of
the Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(b).

 



 

 **2.5** **No Fractional Shares**

 



 

Following the Effective Time, if the aggregate number of Purchaser Shares to
which a Company Shareholder would otherwise be entitled would include a
fractional share, then the number of Purchaser Shares that such former Company
Shareholder is entitled to receive shall be rounded down to the next whole
number and no former Company Shareholder will be entitled to any compensation
in respect of such fractional Purchaser Share.

 



 

 **2.6** **Calculations**

 



 

All amounts of cash Consideration to be received under this Plan of
Arrangement will be calculated to the nearest cent ($0.01) or to the nearest
tenth of one percent (0.10%), as applicable. All calculations and
determinations made by the Company and the Purchaser for the purposes of this
Plan of Arrangement shall be conclusive, final and binding upon the Company
Shareholders.

 



 

 **Article 3 _ 
DISSENT RIGHTS_**

 



 

 **3.1** **Rights of Dissent**

 



 

Pursuant to the Interim Order, each registered Company Shareholder may
exercise rights of dissent in connection with the Arrangement (" **Dissent
Rights** ") under Section 238 of the BCBCA and in the manner set forth in
Sections 242 to 247 of the BCBCA, all as modified by this Article 3 as the
same may be modified by the Interim Order or the Final Order in respect of the
Arrangement, provided that the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution
contemplated by Section 242 of the BCBCA must be sent to and received by the
Company not later than 5:00 p.m. on the Business Day that is two Business Days
before the Company Meeting. Company Shareholders who duly exercise such rights
of dissent and who:

 



 

(a) are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value from the
Company for the Dissenting Shares in respect of which they have exercised
Dissent Rights, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
245 of the BCBCA, will be deemed to have irrevocably transferred such
Dissenting Shares to the Company pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i) in
consideration of such fair value; or

 



 

(b) are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for the
Dissenting Shares in respect of which they have exercised Dissent Rights, will
be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a
Company Shareholder who has not exercised Dissent Rights, as at and from the
time specified in Section 2.3(b)(i), and be entitled to receive only the
Consideration,

 



 

but in no case will the Company or the Purchaser or any other person be
required to recognize such holders as holders of Company Shares after the
completion of the steps set forth in Section 2.3(b), and each Dissenting
Company Shareholder will cease to be entitled to the rights

 



      
 

 



 

of a Company Shareholder in respect of the Company Shares in relation to which
such Dissenting Company Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights and the
central securities register of the Company will be amended to reflect that
such former holder is no longer the holder of such Company Shares as and from
the completion of the steps in Section 2.3(b).

 



 

In addition to any other restrictions set forth in the BCBCA none of the
following shall be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights: (i) Company
Optionholders; (ii) holders of Company PSUs or Company RSUs; and (iii) Company
Shareholders who vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution.

 



 

 **Article 4 _ 
CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS_**

 



 

 **4.1** **Payment of Consideration**

surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares that were
transferred under Section 2.3(b), together with a duly completed Company Share
Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require and such other documents and instruments as
would have been required to effect such transfer under the BCBCA, the
_Securities Transfer Act_ (British Columbia) and the articles of the Company
after giving effect to Section 2.3(b) the former holder of such Company Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall
deliver to such holder following the Effective Time, or make available for
pick up at its offices during normal business hours, a cheque and a share
certificate representing the Share Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive in accordance with Section 2.3(b), less any amounts withheld
pursuant to Section 4.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of Company
PSUs or Company RSUs who received Company Shares pursuant to Sections
2.3(a)(i) and 2.3(a)(iii) shall not receive certificates representing such
Company Shares and, accordingly, shall not be required to deliver any such
certificates in respect of such Company Shares.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 4.3, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Company Shares will be deemed after the time described in Section
2.3(b) to represent only the right to receive from the Depositary upon such
surrender a cheque and a share certificate representing the Consideration that
the holder of such cheque is entitled to receive in accordance with Section
2.3, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.4.

 



 

(c) The Company and the Purchaser will cause the Depositary, as soon as a
Former Company Shareholder becomes entitled to the Share Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.3(b), to:

 



 

(i) forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage paid) to

Transmittal make available at the offices of the Depositary specified in the
Company Share Letter of Transmittal; or

 



 

(iii) if the Company Share Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address
as described in Section 4.1(c)(i) nor contains a request as described in
Section 4.1(c)(ii), forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail
(postage paid) to such former holder at the address of such former holder as
shown on the applicable securities register maintained by or on behalf of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,

 



 

a cheque and a share certificate representing the Share Consideration to such
Former Company Shareholder in accordance with the provisions hereof.

 



 

(d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Date with respect to the Purchaser Shares with a record date on or after the
Effective Date will be payable or paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate or certificates for Company Shares which, immediately prior to the
Effective Date, represented outstanding Company Shares, until the surrender of
certificates for Company Shares in exchange for the Consideration issuable
therefor pursuant to the terms of this Plan of Arrangement. Subject to
applicable Law and to Section 4.4, at the time of such surrender, there shall,
in addition to the delivery of the Share Consideration to which such Company
Shareholder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without
interest, the amount of the dividend or other distribution with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Purchaser
Shares.

 



 

(e) No holder of Company Shares shall be entitled to receive any consideration
or entitlement with respect to such Company Shares other than any
consideration or entitlement to which such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with Section 2.3, this Section 4.1 and the other terms of this Plan
of Arrangement and, for greater certainty, no such holder with be entitled to
receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in connection
therewith, other than any declared but unpaid dividends.

 



 

 **4.2** **Loss of Certificates**

 



 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any outstanding Company Shares that were acquired by the Purchaser
or the Company pursuant to Section 2.3 has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the former holder of such
Company Shares, the Depositary will deliver to such person or make available
for pick up at its offices in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, a cheque and a share certificate representing the Consideration
to which the former holder of such Company Shares is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.3 in accordance with such holders Company Share Letter
of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in relation to any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the former holder of such Company Shares will, as a
condition precedent to the delivery of such Share Consideration, give a bond
satisfactory to the Company, the Purchaser and the Depositary in such sum as
the Purchaser may direct or otherwise indemnify the Company and the Purchaser
in a manner satisfactory to the Company and the

 



       
 

 



 

Purchaser against any claim that may be made against the Company or the
Purchaser with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 



 

 **4.3** **Extinction of Rights**

 



 

If any Former Company Shareholder fails to deliver to the Depositary the
certificates, documents or instruments required to be delivered to the
Depositary under Section 4.1 or Section 4.2 in order for such Former Company
Shareholder to receive the Consideration which such former holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 2.3, on or before the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Date, on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date (i) such former
holder will be deemed to have donated and forfeited to the Purchaser or its
successor any Consideration held by the Depositary in trust for such former
holder to which such former holder is entitled and (ii) any certificate
representing Company Shares formerly held by such former holder will cease to
represent a claim of any nature whatsoever and will be deemed to have been
surrendered to the Purchaser and will be cancelled. Neither the Company nor
the Purchaser, or any of their respective successors, will be liable to any
person in respect of any Share Consideration (including any consideration
previously held by the Depositary in trust for any such former holder) which
is forfeited to the Company or the Purchaser or delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

 



 

 **4.4** **Withholding Rights**

 



 

(a) The Company, the Purchaser and the Depositary will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Company
Shareholder, Company Optionholder, holder of Company PSUs or Company RSUs,
under this Plan of Arrangement (including any payment to Dissenting Company
Shareholders) such amounts as the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax
Act, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of any provincial, state,
local or foreign tax law as counsel may advise is required to be so deducted
and withheld by the Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary, as the case may
be. For the purposes hereof, all such withheld amounts shall be treated as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made on account of the obligation to make payment to such
person hereunder, provided that such deducted or withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of the
Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary, as the case may be.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, the Purchaser and the Depositary is hereby authorized
to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of Purchaser Shares payable as
Share Consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the
Company, the Purchaser or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to
implement such deduction or withholding, and the Company, the Purchaser or the
Depositary will notify the holder thereof and remit to the holder any
unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.

 



      
 

 



 

 **4.5** **No Liens**

shall be free and clear of any Liens or other claims of third parties of any
kind.

(actual or contingent and whether or not previously asserted) based on or in
any way relating to any Company Shares shall be deemed to have been settled,
compromised, released and determined without liability except as set forth in
