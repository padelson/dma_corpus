representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE OFFER 
---------   Section 1.1 The Offer.  ---------   (a) Provided that this
Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1
hereof, as promptly as practical after the date hereof (but in no event later
than the tenth (10/th/) Business Day following the public announcement of the
execution hereof), the Company and Acquisition Company shall commence the
Offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding Shares (together with all
associated shareholder rights) at the Offer Price per Share. The initial
expiration date for the Offer shall be the twenty-first (21st) Business Day
from and after the date the Offer is commenced, including the date of
commencement as the first (1/st/) Business Day in accordance with Rule 13e-4
of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (such 
------------ initial expiration date as it may be extended in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). The obligations of the
Company and/or  --------------- Acquisition Company to accept for payment
and to pay for Shares validly tendered on or prior to the Expiration Date and
not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (the "Tendered Shares") shall be
subject only to (i) there being validly  --------------- tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer at least fifty percent (50%)
of the outstanding Shares of the Company (including for these purposes Shares
issuable upon the exercise of Company Options by Persons who have not entered
into Option Exercise/Cancellation Agreements), after giving effect to the
Offer Closing and the cancellation of any Tendered Shares acquired by the
Company, plus one Share (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other 
----------------- conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. The Company and
Acquisition Company shall, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions of the Offer, accept for payment and purchase, as
soon as practicable after the Expiration Date, all Tendered Shares. In the
event that the number of Tendered Shares, plus the shares issuable upon
exercise of the Acquisition Company Option, without duplication,   
2    would permit the Merger to be effected pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL  (the "Short Form Condition"), all Tendered Shares shall be purchased
by  --------------------  Acquisition Company. In the event the Short Form
Condition is not  satisfied, Tendered Shares having an aggregate purchase
price of $90  million (or such greater amount, not to exceed $95.5 million in
the  aggregate, as may be required for Acquisition Company to own a majority
of  the outstanding Shares (including for these purposes Shares issuable
upon  the exercise of Company Options by Persons who have not entered into
Option  Exercise/Cancellation Agreements) after giving effect to the Offer
Closing  and the cancellation of any Tendered Shares acquired by the Company,
or  such greater amount as Acquisition Company may determine in its sole 
discretion) (the "Capital Contribution") shall be acquired by Acquisition 
--------------------  Company upon the Offer Closing and, after such
acquisition by Acquisition  Company, the balance of the Tendered Shares shall
be acquired by the  Company upon the Offer Closing.    (b) The Offer shall
be made by means of an offer to purchase (the  "Offer to Purchase")
containing the terms set forth in this Agreement and  -----------------  the
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto. Neither the Company nor  ------- 
Acquisition Company shall (i) increase or decrease the Offer Price or  change
the form of consideration payable pursuant to the Offer, (ii)  decrease the
number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii)  amend or waive
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex A attached  ------- 
hereto, (iv) impose any additional conditions or amend any other term or 
condition of the Offer or (v) extend the expiration date of the Offer  beyond
the initial Expiration Date, in each case without the prior written  consent
of Parent. The Company and Acquisition Company shall waive or  modify any
condition set forth in clause (v)(a) (other than in clause  (v)(a) with
respect to a suit, action or proceeding instituted by any  Governmental
Entity that seeks to restrain or prohibit the making or  consummation of the
Offer or the Merger), (d) and (f) of Annex A if so  -------  requested in
writing by Parent. The Company and Acquisition Company agree  that, subject
to the right of termination set forth in Section 8.1 (other  than Section
8.1(d)(i)), in the event the Company or Acquisition Company  are unable to
consummate the Offer on or prior to the Expiration Date due  to the failure
of any condition set forth in Annex A hereto to be satisfied  -------  or
waived, the Company and Acquisition Company shall, if requested by  Parent,
extend the Offer until the earlier of (i) the later of (A) the day  which is
twenty (20) Business Days after the initial Expiration Date and  (B) such
later date which is ten (10) Business Days after the Company  terminates any
third party discussions or negotiations that are permitted  by Section 6.7
below, or (ii) such time as the Minimum Condition is  satisfied and the
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto are satisfied or  -------  waived;
provided, that, the Company shall be permitted but shall not be  --------
----  obligated to extend the Offer if Parent or Acquisition Company is in
breach  in any material respect of its covenants, agreements, representations
or  warranties contained in this Agreement. In addition, the Company and
Parent  agree that the Company and Acquisition Company shall have the right
by  mutual agreement to extend the offer beyond the initial Expiration Date.
In  addition to the foregoing, provided that the Company reasonably
believes  -------- ----  that the Minimum Condition will be satisfied within
such ten (10) Business  Day period, Parent and Acquisition Company shall, if
requested by the  Company, extend the Offer until the earlier of (i) the date
which is ten  (10) Business Days after the initial Expiration Date and (ii)
such time as  the Minimum Condition is satisfied and the conditions set forth
on Annex A  -------  hereto are satisfied or waived. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this  Agreement and the Offer, the parties shall use their
commercially  reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or  cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under  applicable Laws to consummate the Offer.   3    (c) As promptly
as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, with respect to the Offer,
the Company and Acquisition Company, together with such other Persons as
shall be required to be included as parties to such filing, if any, shall
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), a Transaction
Statement on Schedule TO which shall comply with Rule  --- 13(e)(3)
(together with any amendments and supplements thereto and including
the exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall contain or 
----------- incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and a form of
letter of transmittal and any other documents related to the Offer (the
Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase, the letter of transmittal and such other
documents, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, shall be
collectively referred to herein as the "Offer Documents"). The Offer
Documents shall comply in all  --------------- material respects with the
provisions of applicable federal securities laws. The Company, Parent and
Acquisition Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the stockholders
of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company, Acquisition Company and Parent shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Company and Acquisition Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Each of the Company and its counsel, on the one hand, and
Parent and Acquisition Company and their counsel, on the other hand, shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company shall provide
Parent and its counsel in writing with any comments or other communications
that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments or other communications.   Section 1.2 Company and

Company Common Stock owned by Acquisition Company bears to the aggregate
number of Shares then outstanding and not owned by the Company minus (B) the
number of Independent Directors (as defined below) in office at the time of

---- holder complies with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\'s right to appraisal, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Cash Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and,
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the commencement of the Offer, the Company 
------------- and Acquisition Company shall appoint a United States bank or
trust company mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent to act as payment
agent (the "Payment Agent") for the payment of the Offer Price and the Cash
Merger  ------------- Consideration. Prior to the payment time thereof, the
Company and Acquisition Company shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited
with the Payment Agent in a separate fund established for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, for payment upon surrender of the certificates for
exchange in accordance with (i) the Offer to Purchase, in the case of the
Offer, and (ii) this Article III, in the case of the Merger, through the
Payment Agent (in the case of the Offer, the "Offer  ----- Fund" and in the
case of the Merger, the "Merger Fund" and collectively with the ----
----------- Offer Fund, the "Payment Fund"), immediately available funds in
amounts  ------------ necessary to make the payments pursuant to the Offer
by each of the Company and Acquisition Company (in the case of the Offer) and
this Article III (in the case of the Merger) to holders of Shares (except as
otherwise provided in Section 3.1(b) and (d) and Section 3.2). The Payment
Agent shall pay the Offer Price out of the Offer Fund and the Cash Merger
Consideration out of the Merger Fund.   The Payment Agent shall invest the
Payment Fund as directed by Parent in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rates A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody\'s Investor Services or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers\' acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500
million, in each case with maturities not exceeding five (5) days. All
earnings on the Offer Fund shall inure to the benefit of the Company and all
earnings on the Merger Fund shall inure to the benefit of Parent. If for any
reason (including losses), the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the
amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under Article III of
this Agreement, the Company shall in any event be liable for payment  
10   thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.   (b) Payment/Exchange Procedures. As
soon as reasonably practicable  --------------------------- (and in any
event not later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause, the Payment Agent, to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented 
------------ outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
the Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof (the "Cashed
Out Shares") or the  ----------------- consideration set forth in Section
3.1(b) with respect to the Shares covered thereby (the "Exchange Shares"):
(i) a form of letter of transmittal which  --------------- shall: (x)
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent; (y) contain a representation in a form reasonably satisfactory
to Parent as to the good and marketable title of the Shares held by such
holder free and clear of liens, claims, options, charges, rights,
security interests, limitations, encumbrances and restrictions of any kind
("Liens"); and  ----- (z) contain such other customary provisions as the
Company and Parent may reasonably specify; and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates and receiving the aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration, in respect thereof (or the Successor Corporation Shares, in
the case of Exchange Shares). Upon the surrender of each Certificate for (i)
Cashed Out Shares and subject to applicable withholding, the Payment Agent
shall (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws)
pay the holder of such Certificate, the Cash Merger Consideration multiplied
by the number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, and such
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled and (ii) Exchange Shares, the
Surviving Corporation shall exchange any Exchange Shares representative
thereby for Successor Corporation Shares and such Certificates shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent
solely the right to receive the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration or
Successor Corporation Shares relating thereto. No interest or dividends shall
be paid or accrued on the Cash Merger Consideration. If the Cash Merger
Consideration or Successor Corporation Shares (or any portion thereof) is to
be delivered to any Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is registered, it shall be a
condition to such right to receive such Cash Merger Consideration or
Successor Corporation Shares that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person surrendering such Certificates shall pay to the Payment Agent, or the
Company in the case of Exchange Shares, any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Cash Merger Consideration or Successor
Corporation Shares to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Payment Agent or the Company, as applicable, that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" shall mean any
natural  ------ person, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, association or entity of any kind.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Cash Merger Consideration or
Successor Corporation Shares, as applicable, without interest thereon.  
(c) Termination of Fund; No Liability. Promptly following the first 
--------------------------------- anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Payment Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash,  
11   Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Payment Agent\'s duties
shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate formerly
representing a Share may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving
Corporation and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
similar Laws) receive in consideration therefor the aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration or Successor Corporation Shares, as applicable, without any
interest or dividends thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Acquisition Company, Acquisition Company Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Payment Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Cash
Merger Consideration or Successor Corporation Shares, as applicable,
delivered to a public official as required by any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.   (d) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership
Rights by Holders of 
--------------------------------------------------------- Certificates in
Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer ------------------------------------ books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be surrendered and cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article III.   (e) Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate has 
-------------------------------------- been lost, stolen or destroyed, up
been on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Cash Merger Consideration or Successor Corporation Shares, as the case may
be, due to such Person pursuant to this Agreement.   (f) Taxes. The Payment
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold  ----- from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any shareholder of the
Company or Company Option holder such amounts as the Company reasonably and
in good faith determines are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax  ---- law (except that the Company shall not withhold any payments from
a nonemployee director who complies with the requirements to avoid back-up
withholding). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Payment
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the stockholder or Company Option holder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Payment
Agent.   Section 3.4 Company Options.  ---------------   (a) Prior to the
date hereof, the Company has taken all actions necessary and appropriate to

each then  -------------------- outstanding warrant and other Company
Security other than Plan Options and outstanding Shares (collectively, "Other

be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of such Company
Option shall receive an amount in cash in respect thereof, if any, equal to
the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Cash Merger Consideration over
the per Share exercise price thereof and (y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of applicable
withholding taxes).   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, advisors
financing sources and other representatives (collectively, the "Company
Representatives") to (a) provide  ----------------------- Parent and
Acquisition Company and their respective officers, employees, counsel,
advisors, financing sources and representatives (collectively, the "Parent
Representatives") access, during normal business hours and upon 
---------------------- reasonable notice, to the offices and other facilities

materials relating to the financial condition, assets and liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and will permit Parent and Acquisition Company
to make inspections of such as either of them may reasonably require; (b) at
Parent\'s expense, furnish Parent, Acquisition Company and the Parent
Representatives, to the extent available, with such other information with
respect to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries as Parent and
Acquisition Company may from time to time reasonably request; and (c) confer
and consult with the Parent Representatives, as Parent may reasonably
request, to report on operational matters, financial matters and the general
status of ongoing business operations of the Company; provided, 
-------- however, that all requests for such access, inspection, information
or ------- consultations pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be made through
Vincent Wolfington, Don Dailey or David Haedicke, or such other person as
they shall designate in writing to Parent, and shall be conducted in such
manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the Company\'s relationships
with its employees, customers, IOs, Licensees and vendors. Unless otherwise
required by Law and except as is necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents, Parent and Acquisition Company will, and will cause the Parent
Representatives to hold any such information in confidence until such time as
such information otherwise becomes publicly available through no wrongful act
of Parent, Acquisition Company or the Parent Representatives, in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 18, 2000 between
Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") Nothing in this
Section 6.2 shall require any party  ------------------------- or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the institution in possession or control of such information or would
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
Section 6.3 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto shall use its 
------------------ reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things   36   necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, the Offer, and the Merger, which efforts shall include, without
limitation, Parent, Acquisition Company and, as Parent may
reasonably request, the Company using their commercially reasonable efforts,
subject to Section 6.12 hereof, to enter into definitive financing
arrangements with respect to the Financing described in the Bank Commitment
Letters; provided,  -------- that, without Acquisition Company\'s prior
written consent, the Company shall not ---- enter into any definitive
financing agreement which contains terms that differ in any material respect
from those terms expressly set forth in the Bank Commitment Letters. If at
any time after the Effective Time any other action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall take or
cause to be taken all such necessary action, including, without limitation,
the execution and delivery of such further instruments and documents as may
be reasonably requested by the other party for such purposes or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, if at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
or circumstance relating to either the Company or Parent or Acquisition
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries should be discovered by the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, and which should be set forth in an
amendment to the Offer Documents, the discovering party will promptly inform
the other party of such event or circumstance and promptly take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case
as to the extent required by applicable Law. If at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, including the execution of additional
instruments, the proper officers and directors of each party to this
Agreement, as the case may be, shall take all such necessary action. Each of
the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger
(if not accomplished pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL) to be treated as a
recapitalization for financial accounting purposes; provided, that,  --------
---- this sentence shall not require any stockholder of the Company to accept
any different consideration in type or amount than set forth in this
Agreement).   Section 6.4 Consents.  --------   (a) Each of the parties
will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Consents of any Governmental Entity or any other Person
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and all Consents listed on
Section 4.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter.  -------------   (b) The
parties hereto shall take all actions necessary to file as soon as
practicable all notifications, filings, and other documents required
to obtain all Consents or waivers, including, without limitation, under the
HSR Act, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received
from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice and any other Governmental Entity for additional information
or documentation in connection therewith.   (c) The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of the occurrence of any Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other
of the occurrence or failure to occur of an event that would, or, with the
lapse of time would cause, any condition to the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger not to be satisfied.   37    (d) Any party hereto shall
promptly inform the others of any material communication from the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
domestic or foreign government or Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party or any Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith
to make or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Parent will advise the Company promptly in
respect of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which Parent proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other domestic or foreign
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Section 6.5 Publicity. The initial press releases with respect
to the  --------- execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable to Parent
and the Company. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company, Parent nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release with respect to the Merger, the
Offer, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior consultation of the other parties, except as may be required by
law.   Section 6.6 Employee Matters.  ----------------   (a) The
Surviving Corporation shall honor, in accordance with their terms, and shall
make required payments when due under, all Company Plans maintained or
contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (including, but not limited to,
employment, incentive and severance agreements and arrangements), that are
applicable with respect to any employee, director or stockholders of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired)
or their beneficiaries; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
preclude  -------- ------- the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any such Company Plan in accordance with its terms.   (b) As of
the date hereof, employees of the Company shall no longer be given the
opportunity to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company\'s Company Option Plans (other than pursuant to Plan
Options presently outstanding). The Company shall provide its employees with
any requisite notices of the termination of such opportunity on a timely
basis.   Section 6.7 No Solicitation.  ---------------   (a) Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.7, the Company shall not, and
shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its
Subsidiaries\' officers, directors, employees or agents to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any non-public information to any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Company or any of their Affiliates or representatives) (a "Third
Person") concerning any proposal or inquiry relating to any
merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, sale of all or
substantially all of the Company\'s assets, sale of shares of capital stock
or similar business combination transaction involving the Company or any
principal operating or   38   business unit of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (an "Acquisition Proposal"). In  -------------------- the event
that, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Board of Directors receives
an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal and the Board of
Directors determines, in good faith and after consultation with its financial
advisor and legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with the Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable Law, the Board of Directors may do one or more of the
following: (w) withdraw, modify or change the Board of Directors\' approval
or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, (x) approve or
recommend to the Company\'s stockholders an Acquisition Proposal, (y) engage
in discussions and negotiations related thereto (subject to the provisions of
this Section 6.7), and (z) terminate this Agreement upon compliance with
Section 8.1(c). The Board of Directors shall not take the action described in
clause (w), (x), (y) or (z) above until after the Board of Directors shall
have given Parent written notice stating the Board of Directors\' proposed
conduct hereunder and setting forth the information specified in Section
6.7(c) hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal which the Board of
Directors intends to negotiate, accept or recommend. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the exercise of the Company\'s
or its Board of Directors\' rights under this Section 6.7 shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company. Nothing in this Section
6.7(a) shall prevent the Board, after prior written notice thereof to Parent,
from furnishing information to a Third Person which has made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board reasonably determines may lead to
a Superior Proposal and that was not solicited in violation of this
Agreement, provided that, with respect to any Person that is not currently
party to a -------- ---- confidentiality agreement with the Company, such
Person has executed an agreement with confidentiality, standstill and other
provisions substantially similar to those then in effect between the Company
and Parent. "Superior  -------- Proposal" means any proposal made by a Third
Person to acquire, directly or -------- indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, all or substantially all of the equity
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, if and
only if, the Board reasonably determines (after consultation with its
financial advisor and counsel) (i) that the proposed transaction would be
more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the
Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of
this Agreement which as of that time had been definitively proposed by
Parent, and (ii) that the Person making such Acquisition Proposal is
capable of consummating such Acquisition Proposal in a timely manner (based
upon, among other things, the availability of financing and the degree of
certainty of obtaining financing, the expectation of obtaining required
regulatory approvals and the identity and background of such Person).   (b)
Subject to Section 6.7(a) hereof, nothing contained in this Section 6.7 shall
prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to
the Company\'s stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange
offer by a Third Person pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making such disclosure to the Company\'s
stockholders or otherwise which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors,
after consultation with its legal counsel, is necessary under applicable Law
or the rules of any stock exchange or if failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under
applicable Law.   39    (c) The Company shall promptly, but in any event
within three (3) Business Days, advise Parent in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry regarding the making of an Acquisition Proposal,
including any request for information, the material terms and conditions of
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Person
making such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and details, including any
amendments or proposed amendments, of any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry.   (d) The Company shall not engage in any discussions
or negotiations with a Third Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to Section 6.7(a)(y) unless it shall first notify Parent in writing.
If within ten (10) Business Days after the giving of such notice to Parent,
the Company has not terminated such discussions or negotiations, Parent may
upon not less than 48 hours\' prior written notice to the Company terminate
this Agreement.   Section 6.8 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent and
the Company  ------------------------------- shall promptly notify each
other of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event which
would be reasonably likely (i) to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof to the Offer Closing or (ii) to
cause any covenant, condition or agreement hereunder not to be complied
with or satisfied in all material respects; and (b) any failure of the
Company, Parent or Acquisition Company, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by in hereunder in any material respect; provided, however, that no such
notification  -------- ------- shall affect the representations or
warranties of any party or the conditions to the obligations of any party
hereunder.   Section 6.9 Indemnification and Insurance. 
-----------------------------   (a) Acquisition Company and Parent agree
that for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will maintain all rights to indemnification now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries of
the Company as provided in the Company\'s certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or otherwise in effect under any agreement on the date of this
Agreement listed on Section 6.9 of the Company  ----------- Disclosure
Letter. In addition, Acquisition Company and the Parent agree that the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall contain the provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification set forth in the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
certificates of incorporation and bylaws on the date hereof, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
years after the Acceptance Date in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of the Company in respect of actions or omission
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), unless such modification is
required by Law. Notwithstanding the six-year period specified in the
foregoing sentences, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims.   (b) Each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
at all times exercise the powers granted to it by its certificate of
incorporation, its bylaws, and by applicable   40   Law to indemnify and
hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law present or
former directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of the Company
or its Subsidiaries against any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation made against them arising from their service in
such capacities (or service in such capacities for another enterprise at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) prior to and including
the Effective Time, including, without limitation, with respect to matters
relating to this Agreement. Without limiting the scope of the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent, Acquisition Company and Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless, jointly and severally, each director and
executive officer of the Company for any claim arising under Section 160 or
Section 173 of the DGCL or any similar Law as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of whether the
Company could provide such indemnification under the DGCL.   (c) Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Company\'s current and former directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification "tail" policy that provides coverage for events occurring
prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance") that is no less 
------------- favorable than the Company\'s existing policy or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage that is similar thereto; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required  -------- ------- to pay a
premium for the "tail" DandO; Insurance in excess of 150% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company for directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance prior to the date hereof, but in such case shall purchase
as much coverage as possible for such amount. In the event Parent or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.   The costs for maintaining the
DandO; Insurance shall be a Company Expense.   (d) This Section 6.9 is
intended to benefit the current and former directors, officers, controlling
shareholders, employees and fiduciaries of the Company and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Company and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries.   Section 6.10 Performance by the Parent
and Company. Parent hereby agrees to 
------------------------------------- make the Capital Contribution to
Acquisition Company if all other conditions to the Offer have been satisfied
or waived by Parent, and to cause Acquisition Company or Acquisition Company
Sub, as the case may be, to comply with its obligations hereunder. Upon the
purchase by Acquisition Company of a majority of the outstanding Shares
pursuant to the Offer, Acquisition Company hereby agrees, subject to Section
1.3 hereof, to cause the Company to comply with its obligations hereunder and
under the Offer and to cause the Company to consummate the Merger as
contemplated herein.   Section 6.11 No Waivers or Amendments. Prior to the
Effective Time, the  ------------------------ Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent and, after the Offer Closing but prior to
the   41   Effective Time, without the approval of a majority of the
Independent Directors (if the effect thereof would be detrimental to the
stockholders of the Company): (a) amend, terminate or otherwise modify or
waive any provision of any Waiver and Debt Satisfaction Agreement, or any
Expense Agreement or Definitive Financing Agreements, or enter into any new
agreements which are the subject matter thereof, or (b) incur or pay any
Company Expenses (including those incurred or paid prior to the date hereof)
the result of which would be that the Company Expenses exceed the Company
Expense Cap.   Section 6.12 Matters Relating to the Bank Commitment
Letters.  -----------------------------------------------   (a) Parent
shall be primarily responsible for any negotiations with respect to any
definitive agreements regarding the Financing (the "Definitive Financing
Agreements"); provided, however, that (i) the Company 
------------------------------- -------- ------- shall have received prior
notice of, and shall be kept reasonably informed of the ongoing status of,
any such negotiations, (ii) the Company shall take all such actions as are
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such negotiations, and
(iii) Parent shall conduct any such negotiations reasonably and in good
faith. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to close the
Financing on terms consistent with the Bank Commitment Letters and to execute
and deliver the Definitive Financing Agreements. Parent and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy on or before the expiration of
the Offer all requirements of the Definitive Financing Agreements which
are conditions to closing the transactions constituting the Financing and to
drawing the cash proceeds thereunder. Parent shall cause the Company to use
the proceeds of the Financing to pay off the Existing Senior Credit Facility
at the Offer Closing.   (b) Following receipt by either the Company or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, of any written or oral communication to the effect that any
lender is contemplating not providing the Financing or is terminating or
canceling or modifying in any material respect the Bank Commitment Letters,
or that the Financing is unlikely to be obtained, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall promptly communicate such event to the other party and
provide such other party with a true and complete copy of any such written
communication.   Section 6.13 Financial Statements. The Company shall
furnish to Parent  -------------------- within twenty-five (25) days after
the end of each month, commencing with the month ending June 30, 2000, an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related statements of operations and
cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such month and for the
period of the Company\'s fiscal year ended at the end of such period.  
Section 6.14 Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The 
------------------------------------------ representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Offer Closing and the Merger, provided, that, no
stockholder or Affiliate of the Company or  -------- ---- any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any stockholder, partner, officer, director, employee,
attorney, agent or representative of any of the foregoing, shall have any
liability for any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations
and warranties of the Company.   42    Section 6.15 Breach of
Representations and Warranties. Neither the Company 
---------------------------------------- nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
knowingly or intentionally take or fail to take any action that could result
in the representations and warranties contained in Article IV being untrue or
incorrect in any material respect. Prior to the Effective Time, the sole and
exclusive right and remedy of Parent, Acquisition Company or Acquisition
Company Sub in the event that any representations or warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and accurate in all
respects shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1(e)(iv) and Section 8.2, to the extent permitted thereunder, except that
Parent and Acquisition Company shall be entitled to receive the Termination
Fee and the Parent Expenses to the extent provided in Section 8.3.  
Section 6.16 Solvency Opinion. The Company shall take all action reasonably 
---------------- required to obtain the opinions of nationally recognized
valuation and/or appraisal firms as required by clause (v)(e) of Annex A, and
shall cooperate with Parent and Acquisition Company in connection
therewith.   Section 6.17 Shareholders\' Rights Plan. The Board of Directors
of the  ------------------------- Company shall take all further action (in
addition to that referred to in Section 4.18) reasonably required in writing
by Parent in order to render the Company\'s shareholders\' rights plan
inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO MERGER  --------------------

obligations under Section 6.4 hereof and the parties hereto shall have used
reasonable best efforts to lift or remove such order, injunction, restraint
or prohibition; and   (e) the event described in clause (iii) of Annex A
hereto shall  ------- not have occurred.   43    ARTICLE VIII

terminated and the Merger  ----------- contemplated herein may be abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the
Stockholders\' Approval is obtained:   (a) By mutual written consent of the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Company.   (b) By either the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if any Governmental Entity shall
have issued an Order or taken any other action, in each case permanently

representations or warranties only if such breaches would individually or in

person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed.
When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or
certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such
manner as it shall require and/or to give the Company a bond in such sum as
it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Company with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   Section 7.6 Transfer of Stock. Upon surrender to the Company or
its  ----------------- transfer agent, if any, of a certificate for shares
duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or
authority to transfer and of the payment of all taxes applicable to the
transfer of said shares, the Company shall be obligated to issue a new

applicable state and federal securities laws.   Section 7.7 Registered
Stockholders. The Company shall be entitled to 
----------------------- recognize the exclusive right of a person registered
on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, vote and be held

of any person other   9   than such registered owner, whether or not it
shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by
law.   ARTICLE VIII.  INDEMNIFICATION   Section 8.1 Indemnification of
Directors and Officers. The Company 
----------------------------------------- shall indemnify, to the fullest
extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as
presently in effect or as hereafter amended:   (a) Subject to the provisions
of Section 8.11, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether external
or internal to the Company (other than an action by or in the right of the
Company) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer
of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director or officer of another Company, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him
or her in connection with such suit, action or proceeding if he or she acted
in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had not reasonable cause to believe that his
or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that the
person had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
lawful.   (b) Any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys\' fees) and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action
or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.  
Section 8.2 Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Board of 
--------------------------------------- Directors, in its discretion, may
authorize the Company to indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by the  
10   General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as presently in
effect or as hereafter amended):   (a) Subject to the provisions of Section
8.11, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or
in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
an employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of
the Company as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such suit, action or
proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the
Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not,
of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and
in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, that the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his or
her conduct was lawful.   (b) Any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an employee or agent of the
Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as an employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with
the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the
extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in
which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that,
despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem
proper.   Section 8.3 Indemnification Against Expenses. To the extent that
a  -------------------------------- director, officer, agent or employee of
the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 8.1 or in Section 8.2, or
in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.   Section 8.4
Board Determinations. Any indemnification under this 
-------------------- Article VIII (unless required by law or ordered by a
court) shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee
or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of   11   conduct set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2
of this Article VIII. Such determination shall be made (i) by a majority vote
of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even
though less than a quorum, or (ii) if there are no such directors, or if such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or
(iii) by the stockholders of the Company.   Section 8.5 Advancement of
Expenses. Expenses incurred by a director  ----------------------- or
officer in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall
be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized
in this Article VIII. Any advance under this Section 8.5 shall be made
promptly, and in any event within ninety days, upon the written request of
the person seeking the advance.   Section 8.6 Nonexclusive. The
indemnification and advancement of  ------------ expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person, whether or not
entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII, may be entitled under any
statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors
or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office. Each person who is or
becomes a director or officer as described in Section 8.1 shall be deemed to
have served or to have continued to serve in such capacity in reliance upon
the indemnity provided for in this Article VIII. All rights
to indemnification under this Article VIII shall be deemed to be provided by
a contract between the Company and the person who serves as a director or
officer of the Company at any time while these By-laws and other relevant
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and other
applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any repeal or modification thereof
shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.   Section 8.7
Insurance. The Board of Directors may at any time and  --------- from time
to time cause the Company to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company,
or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him or her
and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify
him or her against such liability under the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as presently in effect or hereafter
amended), the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company or these By-
laws.   Section 8.8 Certain Definitions. In the discretion of the Board of 
------------------- Directors of the Company, for the purposes of this
Article VIII, references to "the Company" may also include any constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that
any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, would stand in the same position
under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such  
12   other constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the Company" shall include any
service by a director or officer of the Company which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such person with respect to any employee benefit plan,
its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and
in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Company" as
referred to in this Article VIII.   Section 8.9 Change in Governing Law. In
the event of any amendment or  ----------------------- addition to Section
145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the addition
of any other section to such law which shall limit indemnification rights
thereunder, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, indemnify to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted hereunder, any person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including an action by or in the right of the Company), by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding.   Section 8.10 Standard of Conduct Presumption. In addition to
and  ------------------------------- without limiting the foregoing
provisions of this Article VIII and except to the extent otherwise required
by law, any person seeking indemnification under or pursuant to Section 8.1
of this Article VIII shall be deemed and presumed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.l unless the contrary shall be
established.   Section 8.11 Procedures.  ----------   (a) In addition to
and without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII and except
to the extent otherwise required by law, (i) it shall be a condition of the
Company\'s obligation to indemnify under Sections 8.l(a) and 8.2(a) of this
Article VIII (in addition to any other condition in these By-laws or by-law
provided or imposed) that the person asserting, or proposing to assert, the
right to be indemnified, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of
any action, suit or proceeding in respect of which a claim for
indemnification is or is to be made against the Company, notify the Company
of the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding, including therewith a
copy of all papers served and the name of counsel retained or to be retained
by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding,
and thereafter to keep the Company timely and fully apprised of all
developments and proceedings in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding or as the Company shall request, and (ii) the fees and expenses of
any counsel retained by a person asserting, or proposing to assert, the right
to be indemnified under Section 8.l(a) or 8.2(a) of this Article VIII shall
be at the expense of such person unless the counsel retained shall have been
approved by the   13   Company in writing.   (b) If a claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VIII is not
paid in full by the Company within 90 days after a written claim therefor has
been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expenses of prosecuting such claim.   Section 8.12 Heirs, Executors
and Administrators. The indemnification 
----------------------------------- and advancement of expenses provided by,
or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.  
Section 8.13 Deduction of Certain Amounts. The Company\'s 
---------------------------- indemnification under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of
this Article VIII of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company, or is or was serving, at the request of the Company
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be reduced by
any amounts such person receives as indemnification (i) under any policy of
insurance purchased and maintained on his or her behalf by the Company, (ii)
from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, or (iii) under any other applicable indemnification
provision.   Section 8.14 Severability. If any term or provision of this
Article  ------------ VIII or the application thereof to any person,
property or circumstance shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Article VIII or the application of such term or provision
to persons, property or circumstances other than those as to which it is
invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each term and
provision of this Article VIII shall be valid and enforced to the fullest
extent permitted by law.   ARTICLE IX.  INTERESTED DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND
STOCKHOLDERS   Section 9.1 Validity. Any contract or other transaction
between the  -------- Company and any of its directors, officers or
stockholders (or any corporation or firm in which any of them are directly or
indirectly interested) shall be valid for all purposes notwithstanding the
presence of such director, officer or stockholder at the meeting authorizing
such contract or transaction, or his participation or vote in such meeting or
authorization.   Section 9.2 Disclosure, Approval. The foregoing shall,
however,  -------------------- apply only if the material facts of the
relationship or the interest of each such director, officer or stockholder is
known or disclosed:   (A) to the Board and it nevertheless in good faith

directors present, each such interested director to be counted in determining
whether a quorum is present but not in calculating the majority necessary to
carry the vote; or   14    (B) to the stockholders and they nevertheless
in good faith authorize or ratify the contract or transaction by a majority
of the shares present, each such interested person to be counted for quorum

action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery
to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business, or an officer or agent of the Company having custody of the book in
which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to

determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.   15    (c) In
order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or
the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,

action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.   Section

meeting, except where a person attends for the express purpose of objecting
to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.   Section 10.5 Attendance via Communications
Equipment. Unless  --------------------------------------- otherwise

upon the liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Corporation
(collectively referred to, together with all classes of Common Stock of the
Corporation, as "Junior Securities"); (ii) on a  ----------------- parity
with any class of Capital Stock of the Corporation or series of
Preferred Stock of the Corporation hereafter established the terms of which
expressly provide that such class or series will rank on a parity with the
12.7% Preferred Stock as to dividends and distributions upon the liquidation,
winding-up or dissolution of the Corporation (collectively referred to as

Corporation (collectively referred to as "Senior 
------ Securities"). ----------   (c) Dividends.  ---------   (i)
Beginning on the Issue Date, the Holders of the outstanding shares of 12.7%
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the
Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefor, distributions in
the form of cash dividends on each share of 12.7% Preferred Stock, at a rate
per annum equal to 12.7% of the liquidation preference per share of the 12.7%
Preferred Stock, payable semi-annually. All dividends shall be cumulative,
whether or not declared, on a daily basis from the date of issuance of the
12.7% Preferred Stock and shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on each
Dividend Payment Date, commencing __________, 2001. Dividends declared may be
paid, at the Corporation\'s option, on any Dividend Payment Date either in
cash or by the issuance of additional shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock (and,
at the Corporation\'s option, payment of a whole share (after rounding up) or
cash in lieu of a fractional share) having an aggregate
liquidation preference equal to the amount of such dividends. In the event
that dividends are declared and paid through the issuance of additional
shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock, as provided in the previous sentence, such
dividends shall be deemed paid in full and shall not accumulate. Each
dividend shall be payable to the Holders of record as they appear on the
stock books of the Corporation on the Dividend Record Date immediately
preceding the related Dividend Payment Date. Dividends shall cease to
accumulate in respect of the 12.7% Preferred Stock on the date of their
redemption unless the Corporation shall have failed to pay the relevant
redemption price on the date fixed for redemption.   (ii) All dividends paid
with respect to shares of the 12.7% Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph
(c)(i) shall be paid pro rata to the Holders entitled thereto.   (iii)
Nothing herein contained shall in any way or under any circumstances be
construed or deemed to require the Board of Directors to declare, or the
Corporation to pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of the
12.7% Preferred Stock at any time.   (iv) Dividends accruing on the 12.7%
Preferred Stock for any past Dividend Period and dividends in connection with
any optional redemption pursuant to paragraph (e)(i) may be declared and paid
at any time, without reference to any regular Dividend Payment Date, to
Holders of record on such date, not more than forty-five (45) days prior to
the payment thereof, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors.   -2-   
(v) Dividends payable on the 12.7% Preferred Stock for any period less than a
year shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30- day
months and the actual number of days elapsed in the period for
which payable.   (d) Liquidation Preference.  ----------------------  
(i) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation, the Holders of shares of 12.7%
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders an
amount in cash equal to the liquidation preference for each share
outstanding, plus, without duplication, an amount in cash equal
to accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up (including an amount equal to a
prorated dividend for the period from the last Dividend Payment Date to the
date fixed for liquidation, dissolution or winding-up) before any
distribution shall be made or any assets distributed to the holders of any of
the Junior Securities including, without limitation, Common Stock of the
Corporation. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Holders of 12.7%
Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any distribution in the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation. If
the assets of the Corporation are not sufficient to pay in full the
liquidation payments payable to the Holders of outstanding shares of the
12.7% Preferred Stock and all Parity Securities, then the holders of all such
shares shall share equally and ratably in such distribution of assets first
in proportion to the full liquidation preference to which each is entitled
until such preferences are paid in full, and then in proportion to their
respective amounts of accumulated but unpaid dividends.   (ii) For the
purposes of this paragraph (d), neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of
all or substantially all of the property or assets of the Corporation nor the
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into one or more entities
(except as set forth below) shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, any merger, reorganization or similar transaction that results in a
Change of Control of the Corporation shall be deemed to be a liquidation of
the Corporation for purposes of this paragraph (d).   (e) Redemption. 
----------   (i) Optional Redemption.  -------------------   (A) The
Corporation may, at the option of the Board of Directors, redeem, to the
extent of funds legally available therefor, at any time, in whole or in part,
in the manner provided for in paragraph (e)(iii) hereof, any or all of the
shares of the 12.7% Preferred Stock, at the redemption price equal to 100% of
the liquidation preference plus, without duplication, an amount in cash equal
to all accumulated and unpaid dividends per share (including an amount in
cash equal to a prorated dividend for the period from the Dividend Payment
Date immediately prior to the Redemption Date to the Redemption Date) (the
"Optional Redemption Price"); provided, that, no  -------------------------
-------- ---- redemption pursuant to this paragraph (e)(i)(A) shall be
authorized or made unless prior thereto full accumulated and unpaid dividends
are declared and   -3-   paid in full, or declared and a sum in cash set
apart sufficient for such payment, on the 12.7% Preferred Stock for all
Dividend Periods terminating on or prior to the Redemption Date.   (B) In
the event of a redemption pursuant to paragraph (e)(i)(A) hereof of only a
portion of the then outstanding shares of the 12.7% Preferred Stock, the
Corporation shall effect such redemption on a pro rata basis according to the
number of shares held by each Holder of the 12.7% Preferred Stock, except
that the Corporation may redeem such shares held by Holders of fewer than 10
shares (or shares held by Holders who would hold less than 10 shares as a
result of such redemption), as may be determined by the Corporation.   (ii)
Mandatory Redemption. On __________, 200___ [SIX MONTHS AFTER 
-------------------- MATURITY OF SUBORDINATED DEBT], the Corporation shall
redeem, to the extent of funds legally available therefor, in the manner
provided for in paragraph (e)(iii) hereof, all of the shares of the 12.7%
Preferred Stock then outstanding at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
liquidation preference per share, plus, without duplication, an amount in
cash equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends per share (including,
without limitation, an amount equal to a prorated dividend for the period
from the Dividend Payment Date immediately prior to the Redemption Date to
the Redemption Date) (the "Mandatory Redemption 
-------------------- Price"). -----   (iii) Procedures for Redemption. 
-------------------------   (A) At least thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for any redemption of the 12.7%
Preferred Stock, written notice (the "Redemption Notice") shall be given by
first class mail,  ----------------- postage prepaid, to each Holder of
record on the record date fixed for such redemption of the 12.7% Preferred
Stock at such Holder\'s address as it appears on the stock books of the
Corporation; provided that no failure to give such notice nor any deficiency
therein shall affect the validity of the procedure for the redemption of any
shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock to be redeemed except as to the Holder or
Holders to whom the Corporation has failed to give said notice or to whom
such notice was defective. The Redemption Notice shall state:   (1) whether
the redemption is pursuant to paragraph (e)(i)(A) or (e)(ii) hereof;   (2)
the Optional Redemption Price, or the Mandatory Redemption Price, as the case
may be;   (3) whether all or less than all the outstanding shares of the
12.7% Preferred Stock are to be redeemed and the total number of shares of
the 12.7% Preferred Stock being redeemed;   (4) the date fixed for
redemption;   (5) that the Holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in
the manner, at the place or places and at the price designated,
his certificate or certificates representing the shares of 12.7% Preferred
Stock to be redeemed; and   -4-    (6) that dividends on the shares of
the 12.7% Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall cease to accumulate on such
Redemption Date unless the Corporation defaults in the payment of the
Optional Redemption Price or the Mandatory Redemption Price, as the case may
be.   (B) Each Holder of 12.7% Preferred Stock shall surrender
the certificate or certificates representing such shares of 12.7% Preferred
Stock to the Corporation, duly endorsed (or otherwise in proper form for
transfer, as determined by the Corporation), in the manner and at the place
designated in the Redemption Notice, and on the Redemption Date the full
Optional Redemption Price or Mandatory Redemption Price, as the case may be,
for such shares shall be payable in cash to the Person whose name appears on
such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered
certificate shall be canceled and retired. In the event that less than all of
the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new
certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares.   (C) On
and after the Redemption Date, unless the Corporation defaults in the payment
in full of the applicable redemption price, dividends on the 12.7% Preferred
Stock called for redemption shall cease to accumulate on the Redemption Date,
and all rights of the Holders of redeemed shares shall terminate with respect
thereto on the Redemption Date, other than the right to receive the Optional
Redemption Price or the Mandatory Redemption Price, as the case may be,
without interest; provided, however, that if a notice of redemption shall
have been given as provided in paragraph (iii)(A) above and the
funds necessary for redemption (including an amount in respect of all
dividends that will accrue to the Redemption Date) shall have been
irrevocably deposited in trust for the equal and ratable benefit of the
Holders of the shares to be redeemed, then, at the close of business on the
day on which such funds are segregated and set aside, the Holders of the
shares to be redeemed shall cease to be stockholders of the Corporation and
shall be entitled only to receive the Optional Redemption Price or the
Mandatory Redemption Price, as the case may be, without interest.   (f)
Voting Rights.  -------------   (i) The Holders of 12.7% Preferred Stock,
except as otherwise required under Delaware law or as set forth in paragraph
(ii) below, shall not be entitled or permitted to vote on any matter required
or permitted to be voted upon by the stockholders of the Corporation.  
(ii) So long as any shares of the 12.7% Preferred Stock are outstanding, the
Corporation shall not amend its Certificate of Incorporation so as to: (A)
affect materially and adversely the specified rights, preferences, privileges
or voting rights of Holders of shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock; or (B)
authorize the issuance of additional shares of any class of Senior Securities
(or amend the provisions of any existing class of Capital Stock to make such
class of Capital Stock Senior Securities), without the affirmative vote or
consent of Holders of at least a majority of the issued and
outstanding shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock, voting or consenting, as the
case may be, as one class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or
by resolution adopted at an annual or special meeting.   Notwithstanding
the previous sentence (1) the creation, authorization or issuance of any
shares of any Junior Securities or Parity Securities or (2) the increase or
decrease in the amount   -5-   of authorized Capital Stock of any class
constituting Junior Securities or Parity Securities, including Preferred
Stock constituting Junior Securities or Parity Securities, shall not require
the consent of Holders of 12.7% Preferred Stock and shall not be deemed to
affect adversely the rights, preferences, privileges or voting rights of
Holders of 12.7% Preferred Stock.   (g) Conversion or Exchange. Except as
set forth in the following sentence,  ---------------------- the Holders of
shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock shall not have any rights hereunder to
convert such shares into or exchange such shares for shares of any other
class or classes or of any other series of any class or classes of
Capital Stock of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation proposes
to offer shares of its Common Stock in a Qualified Public Offering, the
Holders of shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock shall have a one time right to
convert such shares immediately after, and conditioned upon, the closing of
the Qualified Public Offering, into such number of shares of Common Stock of
the Corporation as shall equal (i) the aggregate liquidation preference of
such shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock divided by (ii) the price per share at
which the Common Stock of the Corporation is being offered in the Qualified
Public Offering; provided,  --------- however, that the 12.7% Preferred
Stock shall only be convertible to the extent ------- that such conversion
would not adversely affect the Corporation\'s use of recapitalization
accounting, as determined by the Corporation\'s independent public
accountants in their sole discretion.   (h) Reissuance of 12.7% Preferred
Stock. Shares of 12.7% Preferred Stock 
----------------------------------- that have been issued and reacquired in
any manner, including shares purchased or redeemed, shall (upon compliance
with any applicable provisions of the laws of Delaware) have the status of
authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series
and may be redesignated and reissued as part of any series of Preferred
Stock, provided that any issuance of such shares as 12.7% Preferred Stock
must be in compliance with the terms hereof.   (i) Business Day. If any
payment or redemption shall be required by the  ------------ terms hereof to
be made on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment or redemption shall
be made on the immediately succeeding Business Day.   (j) Mergers,
Consolidations and Certain Sales of Assets. The Corporation 
--------------------------------------------------- (A) shall not consolidate
with or merge into any other Person or permit any other Person to consolidate
with or merge into the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Corporation (in a
transaction in which such Subsidiary remains a Subsidiary of the
Corporation); and (B) shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell,
convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties and assets as an entirety; unless in a transaction in which the
Corporation does not survive or in which the Corporation sells, leases
or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets, the
successor entity to the Corporation is organized under the laws of the United
States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the 12.7%
Preferred Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for and shall become
shares of such successor, transferee or resulting Person, having in respect
of such successor, transferee or resulting Person, the same powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and
qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereon that the 12.7%
Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction. Upon any such sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another
Person or any merger or consolidation where the Corporation is not the
surviving entity, such Person or survivor shall become the obligor in respect
of the 12.7% Preferred Stock and the Corporation will be relieved of all
further obligations and covenants hereunder.   -6-    For purposes of the
foregoing, the transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or otherwise, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of
the properties or assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Corporation, the
Capital Stock of which constitutes all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Corporation shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation.   (k)
