Closing Cash Payment, except that the Parent Share of Expenses shall not
reduce the Closing Cash Payment. Following the Closing, Parent shall provide
reasonable documentation to the Selling Stockholder evidencing the final
amount of all such underwriting expenses, and Parent and the Selling
Stockholder then shall reconcile and promptly pay the amounts, if any, owing
to one another for such final underwriting expenses."

that (x) any such block trades made pursuant to subsection (i) are executed by

Parent and Seller, at a discount of no more than five percent (5%) to Parent's
prevailing share price at the time of such trade and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate in any such sale, and (y) Parent shall reasonably assist and

Underwriting Agreement, including by making its executive officers available

lock-up for the reasonable period required by Morgan Stanley, causing its
