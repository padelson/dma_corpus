Representatives and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption of the business of Seller and the Subs.  Buyer

of the ability to effectuate a change of control of the ownership of all or a
substantial portion of the Equity Interests or the Properties, or any similar
transaction that does not involve, or delays or deters, a sale of the Equity

Representatives shall have any liability to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, either under or relating to this Agreement or any

  



        
   

  



  

#### Applicable Law, by virtue of entering into or seeking Bankruptcy
Court approval of such a definitive agreement for an Alternative Transaction

and expenses and Buyers out-of-pocket expenses) actually incurred in the
evaluation of a bid for the Equity Interests, the negotiations and execution
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and efforts related to
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ "). The Break Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement shall be
payable to Buyer if, and to the extent, so provided in _Section 17.3_ and
the Bidding Procedures Order. Any dispute regarding the reasonableness of the
Expense Reimbursement shall be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court.

advisable to procure for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein) or to ensure that such consents and approvals have expired without
being exercised and have therefore been waived, except for those consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities customarily obtained post-closing for
transactions similar to those contemplated hereby or those consents or
approvals which are not required in connection with a sale pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

7.6 _Assumption and Rejection of Contracts and Leases_.

the applicable Sub to assume or reject, as directed by Buyer, any
executory Contracts or unexpired Leases to which any Sub is a party or is
otherwise bound including the rejection of the Gas Gathering and Compression
Services Agreement with Frontier Midstream, LLC. Seller shall give written
notice to Buyer prior to the submission of any motion in their Bankruptcy
Cases with respect to the assumption or rejection by any Sub of any executory
Contracts or unexpired Leases, and, without the prior consent of Buyer,
Seller shall not cause any Sub to assume or reject any executory Contract or

such other terms as the applicable Sub (with the consent of Buyer), and the
non-debtor party to such executory Contract or unexpired Lease may otherwise
agree. In the event of a dispute regarding (i) Cure or (ii) the ability of
Buyer or Seller to provide "adequate assurance of future performance" (within
the meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) under the Contract or
Lease to be assumed, the assumption of such executory Contract or unexpired
Lease shall be conditioned upon resolution of such dispute by the Bankruptcy
Court. Seller (with the consent of Buyer) or Buyer, as applicable, reserves
the right either to reject or nullify the assumption of an executory Contract
or unexpired Lease no later than ten (10) days after a Final Order
determining Cure or any request for adequate assurance of future performance.

converted to a single member limited liability company organized under the
Laws of the State of Delaware (the " _Conversion Transaction_ "), and (2)
cause each such 

  



        
   

  



  

#### limited liability company to elect to be continuously treated as
a disregarded entity from its owner for United States federal income
tax purposes.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that the Conversion Transaction causes Seller to breach any

right to terminate this Agreement due to such breach by Seller as a result of
the Conversion Transactions. The documents affecting the

delivery. Seller shall provide a certificate of the filing and effectiveness
of such Conversion Transaction and the elections described above to the Buyer
at the Closing.

#### (d) The federal, state and local income tax consequences of each
Conversion Transaction shall be reported as a liquidation under Code Section
332 by the Seller (unless the converted Sub is insolvent in which case Code
Section 331 shall apply) and Seller shall not make or permit an election to
be made to treat any such limited liability company as an association taxable
as a corporation. The sale of the membership interests of each limited
liability company resulting from a Conversion Transaction shall be reported
by the parties to this Agreement as a sale of assets by the Seller. Seller
shall bear all tax liability, if any, of the Subs arising from such
conversion.

  

####

the Closing.

and _Section 17.1_, with respect to Buyers termination of this Agreement,
Pool No. 3 (in such capacity, the " _Buyer Representative_ ") shall, with
respect to Seller, be the sole and exclusive representative with respect to

Affected Seller Property that Seller is unable to assign to the applicable
Sub due to legal or contractual restrictions, and any other Property set

or, that is transferable, but Buyer elects, by notice to Seller, to have
Seller retain such Property, including a Property that requires a transfer
fee in connection with its transfer that Buyer elects not to pay
(collectively, the " _Non-Transferred Properties_ "), have conveyed record
title to the applicable Sub.

 TITLE MATTERS**

  

# ** **

  

10.1 _Title Defect Notice_.

  



  

#### (a) At any time on or prior to the Defect Notification Deadline, Buyer
may provide Seller with one or more written notices (each, a " _Title Defect
Notice_ ") of any fact that renders a Subs title to any Lease, Well or Fee
Interest less than Good and Defensible Title (each, a " _Title Defect_ ").
 Each Title Defect Notice shall include, in reasonable detail, a description
of (i) the Lease, Well or Fee Interest with respect to which any Title
Defect(s) has been identified, (ii) the nature of each such Title
Defect(s) and all supporting documents necessary for Seller (as well as any
title attorney or examiner) to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Defects, and (iii) Buyers commercially reasonable good faith estimate of the
Defect Value for each such Title Defect calculated in accordance with the
guidelines set forth in _Sections 10.3.1_  _10.3.6_.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Any Title Defect that is not identified in a timely delivered Title
Defect Notice shall thereafter be forever waived and expressly assumed by
Buyer and shall be deemed to have become a Permitted Encumbrance.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the following matters shall constitute a Title Defect in
the event of a change in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest with
respect to the

  



        
   

  



  

#### Wells, Leases and Fee Interests as set forth in _Exhibit B_ after the
date hereof:  (1) a change in drilling units, spacing or pooling units, or
tract allocations or changes in participating areas, or integration orders
occurring after the date hereof, (2) an after-payout change in Net Revenue
Interest or Working Interest pursuant to a farmout, farmin, consent election,
nonconsent election, integration order or other Contract or event if the
effect of such change is set forth in _Exhibit B-1_ ; (3) defects based on
failure to record Leases issued by any state, or any assignments of record
title or operating rights in such Leases, in the real property, conveyance or
other records of the county or parish in which such Property is located; (4)
defects that have been cured by Applicable Laws of limitations or
prescription; (5) any delay in delivering an assignment earned under a
farmout, participation or similar agreement unless it is determined that the
farmout party or other third party record title holder has refused to deliver
such assignment; and (6) defects in the chain of title consisting of the
failure to recite marital status or omissions of successors or heirship
proceedings, unless it is determined that such failure or omission has
resulted in a third partys actual and superior claim of title to the
Property.

  

#### 

  

10.2 _Determination of Title Defects and Defect Values_.

  



  

### 10.2.1 Within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of a Title
Defect Notice, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing if Seller disagrees with
the Title Defects claimed therein and/or the Defect Values set forth therein.
If Seller fails to provide written objection(s) within such ten (10) Business
Day period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with such Title Defects
and Defect Values and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Defect
Values as set forth in _Article IV._ If Seller provides written notice of
any disagreement with respect to any such claimed Title Defect and/or Defect
Values, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly enter into good faith
negotiations for ten (10) days, and shall attempt to agree in writing on such
matters. If Seller and Buyer reach written agreement, the value agreed by
such parties shall be the Defect Values for such Title Defects and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to such agreed Defect
Values as set forth in _Article IV_.

  

### 

  

### 10.2.2 If Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement concerning either the
existence of a Title Defect or the Defect Value within ten (10) days after
Sellers notice to Buyer of any disagreement with respect to any claimed
Title Defects and/or Defect Value, then such parties shall submit such
dispute to a mutually acceptable attorney licensed to practice law in the
state in which such Lease, Well or Fee Interest is located and having at
least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas title matters for prompt
resolution; provided, however, that if at any time any attorney so chosen
fails or refuses to perform hereunder, a new attorney shall be chosen
by Seller and Buyer. In the event Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon such
mutually acceptable attorney within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of
such written request, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that the attorney shall
be selected by the Senior Chaired Professor of Oil and Gas Law at the
University of Texas School of Law or the next most Senior Chaired Professor
of Oil and Gas Law at the University of Texas School of Law in the event the
most Senior Chaired Professor is unable or unwilling to serve. The cost of any
such attorney shall be borne

  



        
   

  



  

### 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. For any such dispute resolution process,
Seller and Buyer shall present a written statement of their
respective positions on the dispute to the attorney within three (3) Business
Days after the selection of the attorney is confirmed pursuant to the terms
hereof, and within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such statements the
attorney shall make a determination of all points of disagreement in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The determination by the attorney shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto and shall be enforceable against either Seller or Buyer in any
court of competent jurisdiction, and the value, if any, determined by the
attorney with respect to a Title Defect shall be the Defect Value for such
Title Defect. If necessary to complete such determination, the Closing Date
shall be deferred until the attorney has made a determination of the disputed
issues with respect thereto and all subsequent dates and required activities
having reference to the Closing Date shall be correspondingly deferred;
provided, however, that unless the parties mutually agree to the contrary,
the Closing Date shall not be deferred pursuant to this _Section 10.2.2_ for
more than ten (10) Business Days.

  

### 

  

### 10.2.3 If the determination has not been made by the attorney by the
Closing Date, the procedures set forth in _Section 10.5.3_ shall govern.

  

### 

  

### 10.2.4 Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, in the
event that any Title Defect is not waived in writing by Buyer, or cured on or
before the Closing Date to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, then Seller and
Buyer hereby agree that Seller shall cause the applicable Sub to assign to
Seller the affected Lease, Well and/or Fee Interest, as applicable, to which
the Title Defect relates or pertains (the " _Affected Property_ "), in which
case the Affected Property shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be deleted
from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Affected Property; _provided, however_ ,
that if the Title Defect affecting the Affected Property is cured within
sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, and Seller gives notice to Buyer of its
election within such time period, Seller shall have the right to sell and
reassign the Affected Property to the applicable Sub by executing and
delivering to the applicable Sub a recordable reassignment of such Affected
Property substantially in the form of the Bill of Sale, Assignment and
Assumption Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Assignment_ "),
with the required revisions and necessary changes, and Buyer hereby agrees
that it shall cause the applicable Sub to purchase and accept the
reassignment of the Affected Property for the Allocated Value thereof,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if the Affected
Property had not been assigned from the applicable Sub to the Seller. Seller
shall receive the Allocated Value for such Affected Property simultaneously
with the reassignment thereof to the applicable Sub.

  

### 

  

10.3 _Calculation of Defect Value_.

  



  

### 10.3.1 If, because of the Title Defect, title to a particular Lease, Well
or Fee Interest fails completely with the effect that the respective Sub has
no ownership interest in the relevant Lease, Well or Fee Interest, the Defect
Value shall be the Allocated Value of such Lease, Well or Fee Interest
assigned specifically to it on _Exhibit B_.

  



        
   

  



  

### 10.3.2 If a Title Defect exists because a Sub owns a Net Revenue Interest
in a Lease, Well or Fee Interest that is less than the NRI for such Lease,
Well or Fee Interest as set forth on _Exhibit B_ , then the Defect Value with
respect to such Title Defect shall be the amount equal to the product of (i)
the Allocated Value for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest multiplied by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between (x) the NRI for
such Lease, Well or Fee Interest set forth on _Exhibit B_ minus (y) the NRI
for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest agreed or determined to be owned by such
Sub and the denominator of which is the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee
Interest set forth on _Exhibit B_.

  

### 

  

### 10.3.3 If a Title Defect that is not specifically extinguished by the
Confirmation Order is a Lien upon a Lease, Well or Fee Interest then Seller
shall either (a) instruct Buyer to pay at Closing out of the Purchase Price
the sum necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the Title Defect from
such Lease, Well or Fee Interest (the aggregate of all such amounts, the "
_Liquidated Title Defect Payment_ "), or (b) retain the obligation of such
Title Defect and elect to challenge the validity thereof (or of any portion
thereof), in which case Buyer shall extend reasonable cooperation to Seller
in such efforts at no risk or expense to Buyer; provided, however, that if
such Title Defect is not cured by three (3) Business Days prior to Closing,
it shall constitute a Title Defect.

  

### 

  

### 10.3.4 If a Title Defect represents an obligation or burden upon a Lease,
Well or Fee Interest for which the economic detriment to Buyer is not
liquidated but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, the Defect Value
with respect to such Title Defect shall be the sum Seller and Buyer mutually
agree upon in writing in good faith as the present value of the adverse
economic effect such Title Defect will have on such Lease, Well or Fee
Interest. If Seller and Buyer cannot reach such written agreement as to such
Defect Value, then such dispute shall be resolved in the manner set forth in
_Section 10.2_.

  

### 

  

### 10.3.5 The Defect Value shall take into consideration all of the
applicable guidelines as are set forth in _Sections 10.3.1_ , _10.3.2_ ,
_10.3.3_ and _10.3.4_ above.

  

### 

  

### 10.3.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller for individual Title Defects that
have a Defect Value that does not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars
(US$100,000) (" _Individual Title Deductible_ "); and (ii) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller for all Title Defects unless the sum of the Defect Values with respect
to all such Title Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any Title Defects
cured by Seller, exceeds a threshold equal to One Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars (US$1,500,000) (" _Aggregate Title Deductible_ "), after
which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies equal to the sum of Defect Values with respect to Title
Defects that exceed the Aggregate Title Deductible.

  

### 

  

10.4 _Title Benefit Notice_. At any time prior to the Defect
Notification Deadline, Seller may provide Buyer with one or more written
notices (each, a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") if Seller believes that a Sub
owns a greater Net Revenue Interest in any Lease, Well or Fee Interest than
as set forth

  



        
   

  



  

in _Exhibit B_ for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as applicable (a "
_Title Benefit_ "); provided, however, that for any Property subject to an
alleged Title Defect, Seller may deliver a Title Benefit Notice at any time
prior to two days prior to the Auction. Each Title Benefit Notice shall
include, in reasonable detail, a description of (a) the Lease, Well or Fee
Interest, as applicable, with respect to which any Title Benefit(s) has been
identified, (b) the nature of each such Title Benefit(s) and all supporting
documents necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged Title
Benefit and (c) Sellers commercially reasonable good faith estimate of the
value for each such Title Benefit (the " _Benefit Values_ ") calculated in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in _Section 10.6_.

  



  

10.5 _Determination of Title Benefits and Benefit Values_.

  



  

### 10.5.1 Within ten (10) days after Buyers receipt of a Title Benefit
Notice, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing if Buyer disagrees with the
Title Benefits claimed therein and/or the Benefit Values set forth therein.
If Buyer fails to provide written objection(s) within such ten (10) day
period, Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with such Title Benefits and
Benefit Values and such Benefit Values will be credited as an offset against
any Defect Values for Title Defects, if any, with the remaining Benefit Value
after offset being an increase to the Purchase Prices as set forth in
_Article IV_. If Buyer provides written notice of any disagreement with
respect to any such claimed Title Benefit and/or Benefit Values, then Seller
and Buyer shall promptly enter into good faith negotiations for ten (10) days
and shall attempt to agree in writing on such matters. If Seller and Buyer
reach written agreement, the value agreed by Seller and Buyer shall be the
Benefit Values for such Title Benefits and will be credited as an offset
against any Defect Values for Title Defects, if any, with the remaining
Benefit Value after offset being an increase to the Purchase Price as set
forth in _Article IV_.

  

### 

  

### 10.5.2 If Seller and Buyer cannot reach written agreement concerning
either the existence of a Title Benefit or the Benefit Value within ten (10)
days after Buyers notice of any disagreement with respect to any claimed
Title Benefits and/or Benefit Value, then Seller and Buyer shall submit such
dispute to a mutually acceptable attorney licensed to practice law in the
state in which such Lease, Well or Fee Interest is located and having at
least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas title matters for prompt
resolution; provided, however, that if at any time any attorney so chosen
fails or refuses to perform hereunder, a new attorney shall be chosen by
Seller and Buyer. In the event Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon such
mutually acceptable attorney within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of
such written request, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that the attorney shall
be selected by the Senior Chaired Professor of Oil and Gas Law at the
University of Texas School of Law or the next most Senior Chaired Professor
of Oil and Gas Law at the University of Texas School of Law in the event the
most Senior Chaired Professor is unable or unwilling to serve. The cost of
any such attorney shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. For any
such dispute resolution process, Buyer and Seller shall present a written
statement of their respective positions on the dispute to the attorney within
three (3) Business Days after the attorney is selected pursuant to the terms
hereof, and within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such statements the
attorney shall make a determination of all points of disagreement in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination
by the attorney shall be

  



        
   

  



  

### conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be enforceable against
either Seller or Buyer in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the value
determined by the attorney with respect to a Title Benefit shall be the
Benefit Value for such Title Benefit.

  

### 

  

### 10.5.3 If the attorney does not make a determination of the disputed
issues prior to the Closing Date, the Closing will proceed and such
determination shall be made by such attorney after the Closing Date and prior
to the determination of the Final Purchase Price unless the amount in dispute
with respect to the matters set forth in this _Article X_ would meet the
threshold for a termination right of either Seller or Buyer as set forth in
_Section 17.1.5_ , in which case the Closing Date shall be deferred and all
subsequent dates and required activities having reference to the Closing Date
shall be correspondingly deferred; provided, however, that unless the parties
mutually agree to the contrary, the Closing Date shall not be deferred
pursuant to this _Section 10.5.3_ for more than ten (10) Business Days, and
the Agreement may thereafter be terminated pursuant to _Section 17.1.5_.

  

### 

  

10.6 _Calculation of Benefit Value_. If a Title Benefit exists because a Sub
owns a NRI in a Lease, Well or Fee Interest that is greater than the NRI for
such Lease, Well or Fee Interest as set forth on _Exhibit B,_ then the
Benefit Value with respect to such Title Benefit shall be the amount equal to
the product of (i) the Allocated Value for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest
multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference
between (x) the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest agreed or determined
to be owned by such Sub minus (y) the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee
Interest set forth on _Exhibit B_ and the denominator of which is the NRI for
such Lease, Well or Fee Interest set forth on _Exhibit B_. The Benefit Value
for a Title Benefit shall be subject to the Individual Title Deductible and
Aggregate Title Deductible.

  



  

10.7 _Affected Seller Properties_. Seller hereby agrees that it shall, prior
to the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent to assign, if required, the Affected Seller Property, if any, to the
appropriate Sub, and if obtained or not required, to execute and deliver to
the appropriate Sub a recordable assignment of each Affected Seller Property
substantially in the form of the Assignment with the required revisions and
necessary changes. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the
contrary, if consent to assign is required and cannot be obtained prior
to the Closing, Seller shall, if requested by Buyer in writing, retain
the applicable Affected Seller Property and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value ascribed to such Affected
Seller Property; _provided, however_ , that in the event Seller obtains such
consent to assign within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, Seller shall
execute and deliver to the appropriate Sub a recordable assignment of such
Affected Seller Property substantially in the form of the Assignment with the
required revisions and necessary changes, and Buyer hereby agrees that it
shall cause the appropriate Sub to receive such assignment and to pay to
Seller simultaneously with such receipt an amount equal to the Allocated
Value for such Affected Seller Property.

  



  

10.8 _Post-Closing Title Determination_. Subject to the rights of Seller or
Buyer to terminate this Agreement provided for herein, in the event the title
attorneys determination of the disputed issues is not rendered within ten
(10) Business Days following the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 10.5.3_ ,
the Affected Property shall be deleted from this Agreement effective as of
Closing and the Purchase Price reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Affected Property.  Promptly after the attorneys determination
of the Defect Value or Benefit Value for the

  



        
   

  



  

Title Defect or Title Benefit, the parties shall deliver such conveyances and
reduce or increase the Purchase Price in the Final Settlement
Statement necessary to implement the determination.

  



  

# **ARTICLE XI 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

  



  

11.1 _Presence of Wastes, NORM, Hazardous Substances and Asbestos_. **BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN USED TO EXPLORE FOR, DEVELOP AND
PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS, AND THAT SPILLS OF WASTES, CRUDE OIL, PRODUCED WATER,
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE OCCURRED THEREON.
ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT, MAY CONTAIN
ASBESTOS, HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OR NORM. NORM MAY AFFIX OR ATTACH ITSELF TO
THE INSIDE OF WELLS, MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT AS SCALE OR IN OTHER FORMS, AND
NORM-CONTAINING MATERIAL MAY HAVE BEEN BURIED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ON THE
PROPERTIES. A HEALTH HAZARD MAY EXIST IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPERTIES BY
REASON THEREOF.  SPECIAL PROCEDURES MAY BE REQUIRED FOR REMEDIATION,
REMOVING, TRANSPORTING AND DISPOSING OF ASBESTOS, NORM, HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
AND OTHER MATERIALS FROM THE PROPERTY.** **WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTIES
OWNED BY THE SUBS AND ACQUIRED INDIRECTLY BY BUYER AT CLOSING PURSUANT TO ITS
PURCHASE OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS, BUYER HEREBY AGREES TO CAUSE THE SUBS TO
ASSUME ALL LIABILITY FOR THE ASSESSMENT, REMEDIATION, REMOVAL, TRANSPORTATION
AND DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES.**

  



  

11.2 _Environmental Assessment_.

  



  

#### (a) Subject as hereinafter provided, Buyer shall have the opportunity to
conduct at its expense an environmental assessment of the Leases, Wells and
Fee Interests, which may include invasive testing of the soil, groundwater,
surface water, air and other environmental media and of building materials,
equipment or facilities which would be conducted by a reasonable and prudent
operator under the same or similar circumstances; _provided, however_ , that
Buyer shall not conduct any such invasive testing prior to providing Seller
with a written description of the proposed invasive testing and a reasonable
period of time to provide comments, which Buyer agrees to consider in good
faith. Seller or the respective Sub will provide reasonable access for this
purpose to such Leases, Wells ands Fee Interests operated by such Sub. For
any Wells not operated by a Sub, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in contacting the operators of any such non-operated Wells directly to
attempt to arrange for access for the purposes of environmental assessment.
 While performing any environmental assessment, Buyer and any of
its Representatives shall comply with Sellers and the respective
Subs environmental and safety rules and policies with respect to the Leases
and Sub operated Wells, and with the operators environmental and safety
rules and policies on all other Wells, and permit Seller to observe all

  



        
   

  



  

#### aspects of each environmental assessment. Buyer shall be
responsible, at its sole cost, risk and expense, for the management and
disposal of any wastes generated during any environmental assessment in
compliance with all Applicable Laws and for restoring the condition of any
part of the Leases, Wells and Fee Interests that are disturbed as a result of
any environmental assessment.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Buyer will notify Seller in advance of any disclosure of the results
of its environmental assessment to any Governmental Authority and will
furnish Seller copies of all materials to be disclosed prior to any
disclosure thereof and will not disclose any such information unless such
disclosure is expressly required by Applicable Law or is required pursuant to
legal process of any court or Governmental Authority subsequent to the
exhaustion of all appeals.  As soon as possible after Buyers receipt
thereof, Buyer shall forward to Seller copies of all data and test results,
and, if subject to an Adverse Environmental Condition Notice, of Buyers
remediation cost estimates and recommended remediation procedures.
Buyers remediation cost estimates and recommended remediation procedures
shall be based upon the most economically reasonable response action, if any,
required under Environmental Laws to bring the Adverse Environmental
Condition into compliance with standards applicable to industrial properties
under the same or similar circumstances, that does not materially impair the
existing business use of the Properties, assuming the Leases, Wells and Fee
Interests remain in operation as currently operated (the "
_Remediation Amount_ ").

  

#### 

  

#### (c) **BUYER HEREBY AGREES TO RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS, AND
DEFEND THE SELLER GROUP FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND LOSSES INCURRED OR
SUFFERED BY THE SELLER GROUP, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY: (I) FROM DAMAGE TO
THE PROPERTIES AND ANY OTHER PROPERTY AND PHYSICAL INJURY AND DEATH TO
PERSONS IN CONNECTION WITH, OR ARISING OUT OF, OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO, BUYERS
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, AND (II) AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH BY BUYER OR ITS
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 11.2_.**

  



  

11.3 _Notice of Adverse Environmental Conditions_. At any time on or prior to
the Defect Notification Deadline, Buyer may provide Seller with one or more
written notices (each, an " _Adverse Environmental Condition Notice_ ") of
the existence of one or more Adverse Environmental Conditions at or relating
to any Lease, Well or Fee Interest. Each Adverse Environmental Condition
Notice shall include, in reasonable detail, a description of (a) the Lease,
Well or Fee Interest with respect to which any such Adverse Environmental
Condition has been identified, (b) the nature of each such Adverse
Environmental Condition and (c) Buyers estimate of the Remediation Amount
(the " _Buyer Remediation Amount_ ") for each such Adverse Environmental
Condition. In preparing the Buyer Remediation Amount, Buyer shall apply
economically reasonable standards applicable to industrial locations,
including risk-based assessments, the execution, placement, and filing of
engineering controls, deed notices, institutional controls, and other cost-
effective remedial actions. Any Adverse Environmental

  



        
   

  



  

Condition that is not identified in a timely delivered Adverse Environmental
Condition Notice shall, except to the extent representing a breach of
_Section 5.23_ thereafter be forever waived and expressly assumed by Buyer.

  



  

11.4 _Determination of Adverse Environmental Conditions and Remediation
Values_.

  



  

### 11.4.1 Within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of an Adverse
Environmental Condition Notice, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing if
Seller disagrees with any Adverse Environmental Condition or Buyer
Remediation Amount set forth therein. If Seller fails to provide such notice,
(a) Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with such Adverse Environmental
Condition, and such Buyer Remediation Amount set forth with respect to the
relevant Adverse Environmental Condition, and the Buyer Remediation Amount
shall become the "Final Remediation Amount" for such Adverse Environmental
Condition, and (b) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Final
Remediation Amount as set forth in _Section 4.2.5_. If Seller provides such
notice of disagreement, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly enter into good
faith negotiations and shall attempt to agree in writing on the Remediation
Amount, if any, with respect to each relevant Adverse Environmental Condition
agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer (such agreed amount, the "
_Agreed Remediation Amount_ " which shall become the "Final Remediation
Amount" for such Adverse Environmental Condition), and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by any such Final Remediation Amount as set forth in
_Section 4.2.5_.

  

### 

  

### 11.4.2 If Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement as to whether an
Adverse Environmental Condition exists and/or as to the Remediation Amount
for any Adverse Environmental Condition agreed in writing by Seller and
Buyer, in each case within twenty (20) days after Sellers notice of its
disagreement with an Adverse Environmental Condition Notice, then Buyer and
Seller may agree to (a) elect to have the subject Lease, Well of Fee Interest
(and any integrally related Facilities, as agreed in writing between Seller
and Buyer) assigned from the applicable Sub to Seller, and removed from the
list of Leases, Wells and Fee Interests in exchange for a reduction of
the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Retained Properties; _provided, however_ , that the aggregate reduction in
the Purchase Price for all Retained Properties, if any, shall be limited to
ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price; (b) permit Seller to fully remove,
remediate and resolve such Adverse Environmental Condition, at Sellers sole
cost, provided that, if feasible, Seller shall (i) complete such
removal, remediation and resolution prior to Closing, and (ii) provide, at
its sole cost, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, acting in a
commercially reasonable good faith manner, that no Adverse Environmental
Condition existed, or that the Adverse Environmental Condition that did exist
has been fully removed, remediated and resolved; or, if neither of the
preceding subsections (a) and (b) resolves the issues between Buyer and
Seller; or (c) submit the questions as to whether an Adverse Environmental
Condition exists and, if so, the Remediation Amount for such Adverse
Environmental Condition to the Bankruptcy Court for final resolution (if it
determines that an Adverse Environmental Condition exists, its determination
of the Remediation Amount therefor being the " _Bankruptcy Court Remediation
Amount_ " which shall become the "Final Remediation Amount" for such Adverse
Environmental Condition),

  



        
   

  



  

### in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Final
Remediation Amount for such Adverse Environmental Condition. If
necessary, the calculation of the Final Remediation Amount shall be deferred
unless the amount in dispute with respect to the matters set forth in this
_Article XI_  would meet the threshold for a termination right of Seller or
Buyer, in which case the Closing Date shall be deferred and all subsequent
dates and required activities having reference to the Closing Date shall be
correspondingly deferred until the Bankruptcy Court has made a determination
of the disputed issues with respect thereto; provided, however, that unless
the parties mutually agree to the contrary, the Closing Date shall not be
deferred pursuant to this _Section 11.4.2_ for more than ten (10) Business
Days and the Agreement may thereafter be terminated pursuant to _Section
17.1.6_.

  

### 

  

### 11.4.3

  

### 

  

#### (a) If Buyer and Seller agree in writing to permit Seller to remove,
remediate and resolve any Adverse Environmental Condition prior to Closing
pursuant to the terms of _Section 11.4.2_  above, and such actions cannot be
accomplished prior to the Closing Date, Seller may notify Buyer of Sellers
intention to diligently pursue and complete such actions within sixty (60)
days of the Closing Date. In such event, Seller shall cause the affected
Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as applicable, to be assigned from
the appropriate Sub to Seller and such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as
applicable, shall be, as hereinafter provided, Retained Properties on the
Closing Date and the Allocated Value of such Retained Properties shall be

# **ARTICLE XIV 
 POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS**

  

# ** **

  

14.1 _Final Settlement Statement_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare, in accordance with this Agreement and with GAAP, a statement ("
_Final Settlement Statement_ "), a copy of which shall be delivered by
Buyer to Seller no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, setting
forth each adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price necessary to
determine the final Purchase Price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") and
showing the calculation of such adjustments in accordance with GAAP and
_Article IV_.  Seller shall provide Buyer all assistance reasonably requested
by Buyer that may be useful and/or necessary for the preparation of the Final
Settlement Statement. Seller shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of the
Final Settlement Statement to review such statement and to provide
written notice to Buyer of Sellers objection to any item on the statement.
Sellers notice shall identify the item(s) objected to and the reasons

  



        
   

  



  

and support for the objection(s). If Seller does not provide written
objection(s) within such sixty (60)-day period, the Final Settlement
Statement (and the Final Purchase Price reflected therein) shall be deemed
correct and shall not be subject to further adjustment. If Seller
provides written objection(s) within such sixty (60)-day period, the Final
Settlement Statement (and the Final Purchase Price therein) shall be deemed
correct with respect to the items not objected to, and Buyer and Seller shall
meet to negotiate and resolve the objections within fifteen (15) days of
Buyers receipt of Sellers objections. If Seller and Buyer agree in writing
on all objections, the adjusted Final Settlement Statement shall be deemed
correct and shall not be subject to further adjustment. Any items not agreed
to at the end of the fifteen (15)-day period may, upon either Sellers or
Buyers written request, be resolved in accordance with _Section 14.2_.

  



  

14.2 _Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon the Final Settlement
Statement, the dispute shall be promptly submitted to the Bankruptcy Court
for resolution.

  



  

14.3 _Retention of Funds by Seller_. Seller shall retain from the Preliminary
Purchase Price sufficient funds in an amount reasonably calculated to satisfy
any and all payment obligations, if any, to Buyer under _Section 14.4_ (the "
_Seller Retained Funds_ "). In the event the parties can not agree, this
amount will be determined by the Bankruptcy Court. Seller shall maintain the
Seller Retained Funds on deposit in a separate, interest bearing, debtor in
possession bank account maintained in accordance with Orders of the
Bankruptcy Court and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of the United
States Trustee, until such time, if any, as payments are due to Buyer under
_Section 14.4_.

  



  

14.4 _Payment of Final Purchase Price_. If the Purchase Price shown on the
Final Settlement Statement is more than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyer
shall pay such difference to Seller in immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement has been agreed
to in writing by Seller or Buyer or decided by the Bankruptcy Court, as
applicable. If the Purchase Price shown on the Final Settlement Statement is
less than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Seller shall pay such difference to
Buyer from the Seller Retained Funds in immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement has been agreed
in writing by Seller or Buyer or decided by the Bankruptcy Court, as
applicable.

  



  

14.5 _Receipts Not Reflected in Purchase Price_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, any production of Hydrocarbons from
or attributable to the Properties (and all products and proceeds attributable
thereto) and any other income, proceeds and receipts earned with respect to
the Properties which are not reflected in the adjustments to the Purchase
Price following the final adjustment pursuant to _Section 14.1_ shall be
treated as follows:

  



  

#### (a) all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the
Properties (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and all other
income, proceeds and receipts earned with respect to the Properties from and
after the Effective Time shall be the sole property and entitlement of Buyer,
and, to the extent received by Seller, Seller shall fully disclose,
account for and remit the same promptly to Buyer; and

  



        
   

  



  

#### (b) all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the
Properties (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and all other
income, proceeds and receipts earned with respect to the Properties prior to
the Effective Time and all amounts referenced under _Section 4.2._ 1 which
are not paid until after the Closing Date shall be the sole property and
entitlement of Seller, and, to the extent received by Buyer or a Sub, Buyer
shall fully disclose, account for and remit the same promptly to Seller.

  

#### 

  

14.6 _Receipt, Remittance and Assignment of Accounts Receivable_.

  



  

### 14.6.1 From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause each Sub to, and
each Sub hereby agrees to, receive the Subs A/R, the Severance Tax Abatement
Amount and the New Mexico Withholding Tax Amount (collectively, the "
_Accounts Receivable_ ") reflected in the books and records of each
applicable Sub generally in accordance with the billing and receipt practices
presently applied by each such Sub in the receipt of its Accounts Receivable.
In connection with such receipts by a Sub, if a payment is received from an
account debtor who has not designated the invoice being paid thereby, such
payment will be applied to the earliest invoice outstanding with respect to
indebtedness of such account debtor, except for those invoices which are
subject to a dispute to the extent of such dispute.

  

### 

  

### 14.6.2 Buyer will, on or before the tenth (10) Business Day of each
calendar month commencing with the second complete calendar month
following the Closing Date, deliver to Seller a written report (" ** _
_Collection Report__** **"** ) of the following information with respect to
the Accounts Receivable:

  

### 

  

#### (a) The aggregate amount of the Accounts Receivable (and the number of
accounts comprising such Accounts Receivable); and

  

#### 

  

#### (b) The aggregate amount of cash received that relates to the Accounts
Receivable during the period from the Closing Date through the date of each
Collection Report.

  

#### 

  

### 14.6.3 If, after the Closing Date, any Sub or Buyer receives any
remittance from any account debtors with respect to the Accounts
Receivable, Buyer will cause the applicable Sub to, and such Sub hereby
agrees to, endorse such remittance to the order of Seller and forward it to
Seller upon receipt thereof.

  

### 

  

### 14.6.4 In the event Seller receives any remittance from or on behalf of
any account debtor with respect to accounts receivable arising from invoices
issued by any Sub subsequent to the Closing for services rendered and/or
Hydrocarbons sold subsequent to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to
endorse such remittance to the order of the applicable Sub and forward it to
such Sub immediately upon receipt thereof.

  

###

provided in this Agreement, any expenses with respect to the
Properties incurred prior to or after the Effective Time, which are not
reflected in the adjustments to the Purchase Price following the final
adjustment pursuant to _Section 14.1_  shall be treated as follows:

  



        
   

  



  

#### (a) all expenses with respect to the Properties incurred prior to the
Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Seller and Seller shall
promptly pay, or, if any Claims underlying such expenses are not
discharged by the Confirmation Order and are paid by Buyer, promptly
reimburse Buyer or such Sub for such amounts; and

  

#### 

  

#### (b) all expenses with respect to the Properties incurred after the
Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Buyer and Buyer shall promptly
pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller for such amounts.

  

#### 

  

14.8 _No Duplicative Effect; Methodologies_. The provisions of _Article IV_
, _Section 14.1_ and of any other transaction document executed in connection
with this Agreement and the Final Order shall apply in such a manner so as
not to give the components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of
adjustment and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Parties covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be)
included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or reduction) more than
once in the calculation of (including any component of) the Adjusted Purchase
Price, or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the
effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or reduction)
would be to cause such amount to be overstated or understated for purposes of
such calculation. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, if there is a
conflict between a determination, calculation, methodology, procedure or
principle set forth in the definitions contained in this Agreement, as
applicable, on the one hand, and those provided by GAAP, on the other hand,
(a) the determination, calculation, methodology, procedure or principle
set forth in this Agreement, as applicable, shall control to the extent that
the matter is specifically provided for in this Agreement and (b) the
determination, calculation or methodology, procedure or principle prescribed
by GAAP shall control to the extent the matter is not so addressed in this
Agreement, as applicable, or requires reclassification as an asset or
liability to be included in a line item or specific adjustment.

  



  

14.9 _Audit Rights_. Seller and/or its Representatives shall have the right
to review, for a period of up to eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date, the books and records of each Sub and the Affiliates of each such Sub

payment, statement, report or other document provided to Seller or required
to be provided to Seller as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, with
respect to payments to be made by a Sub to Seller in connection with the Subs
A/R, the Severance Tax Abatement Amount and the New Mexico Withholding Tax
Amount.

19.2 _Governing Law_.  **THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR
CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES.**

  



        
   

  



  

19.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as
permitted below, no party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder
without the other parties prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or unduly delayed. Buyer shall, without the obligation
to obtain the prior written consent of the other parties but with the
obligation to provide contemporaneous or prior notice to such parties,
be entitled to assign (i) this Agreement or all or any part of its rights
or obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates of Buyer, or (ii) up to
an undivided 60% of this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder
to Sabco, and/or (iii) up to an undivided 10% of this Agreement and
its rights and obligations hereunder to Intrepid or another entity designated
by Buyer to operate the Properties for Buyer after Closing. No assignment by
Buyer of any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be
effective unless the assignee shall execute and deliver to the Seller a
written agreement between Buyer and such Permitted Assignee(s), which shall
include (i) a description of the rights and obligations to be assigned by
Buyer to the assignee; (ii) a ratification of, and agreement by the assignee
to become subject to and bound by, the terms of this Agreement; and (iii)
representations and warranties of such assignee that are comparable to the
representations and warranties of Pool No. 3 set forth in _Section 6.1_;
provided, however, that if the assignee is Intrepid or Sabco, such
representations shall be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit M_, as
applicable. No assignment of rights or obligations by Buyer will release or
discharge Pool No. 3 from any of its obligations as the "Buyer" under this
Agreement or under any Exhibit, Schedule, certificate, document, instrument,
agreement, or writing delivered pursuant hereto. In the event of any
assignment of this Agreement by Buyer to any of the Permitted Assignees
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 19.3_, the obligations
and liabilities of the Permitted Assignees shall be several and not joint and
several. Each Permitted Assignee shall be liable to Seller only for that
percentage of any obligation hereunder equivalent to the percentage interest
in this Agreement assigned to such Permitted Assignee by Buyer. The
representations and warranties made by Buyer and each Permitted Assignee
shall be deemed to be made only by the entity making such representation or
warranty, and neither Buyer or any Permitted Assignee shall be deemed
responsible or liable for the breach of any representation or warranty by any
other party. In the event of such assignment by Buyer to a Permitted
Assignee(s), Seller shall negotiate in good faith to amend the
Escrow Agreement to allow such Permitted Assignee(s) to become a party to
the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

19.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties in respect of its subject matter and supersedes all prior
understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties,
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter
hereof, excluding the Confidentiality Agreement dated **** April 7, 2009,
between Seller and Buyer (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which is
addressed in _Section 19.8_. Other than with respect to the
Persons comprising Seller Group, there are no third party beneficiaries
having rights under or with respect to this Agreement.

  



  

19.5 _Amendment; Waiver_. No amendment, modification, replacement,
termination or cancellation of any provision of this Agreement will be valid,
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer, Seller, EPEC and
Miller.  No waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach
of warranty

  



        
   

  



  

or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising because of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  



  

19.6 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof;
__provided, however__ , that if any provision of this Agreement, as applied
to any party or to any circumstance, is adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction, arbitrator, or mediator not to be enforceable in accordance
with its terms, the parties agree that the court of competent jurisdiction,
arbitrator, or mediator, as applicable, making such determination will have
the power to modify the provision in a manner consistent with its objectives
such that it is enforceable, and/or to delete specific words or phrases, and
in its reduced form, such provision will then be enforceable and will be
enforced.

  



  

19.7 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any party because of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign Law will be
deemed also to refer to such Law as amended and all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. Pronouns in
masculine, feminine, and neuter genders will be construed to include
any other gender, and words in the singular form will be construed to include
the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder" and words of
similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof. References herein to any Article or Section shall be references
to an Article or Section of this Agreement, unless the context
clearly requires otherwise.

  



  

19.8 _Confidentiality_. All information made available by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement shall be maintained as confidential by Buyer until
Closing, provided that Buyer may disclose such information to any Permitted
Assignee. The parties shall remain subject, until the Closing, to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, at which time of Closing such
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Supplemental Confidentiality Agreement shall, with respect to the Non-
Transferred Properties, remain in full force and effect pursuant to its
terms. Buyer shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that
Buyers employees, consultants, Representatives and agents comply with the
provisions of this _Section 19.8_. After Closing, Seller will, in
accordance with the requirements of all Applicable Law, maintain as
confidential all information regarding the Subs and the Properties permitted
to be retained (either as an original or copy) hereunder.

  



  

19.9 _Headings_. The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and will not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

19.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in five (5) or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile shall be equally as effective as
delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party

  



        
   

  



  

delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile also shall
deliver an original executed counterpart of this Agreement, but the failure
to deliver an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity,
enforceability and binding effect of this Agreement.

Interests by Seller. Buyer shall be responsible for Texas franchise Taxes of
the Subs for periods after the Closing Date.

  

##### 

  

##### (iii) Seller shall be liable for all income and other Taxes of the Subs
attributable to income, production or activity through the Closing Date,
including any Tax liability attributable to the sale of the Equity Interests
by Seller. Buyer shall be responsible for income and other Taxes of the Subs
attributable to income, production or activity for periods occurring after
the Closing Date.

  

##### 

  

##### (iv) With respect to Ad Valorem Taxes, in the case of any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Effective Time (the "
_Straddle Period_ "), the Ad Valorem Taxes accrued as of the Effective Time
shall be equal to the amount of such Ad Valorem Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period up to and including the Effective Time, and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period. The party
liable for any Ad Valorem Tax shall have all available rights to legally
contest the Tax, provided, however, that the Buyer shall control, but shall
allow the Seller (at Sellers request and expense) to participate in, any
contest with respect to Ad Valorem Taxes for a Straddle Period).

  

##### 

  

##### (v) In the case of Straddle Periods for all other Taxes any allocation
and responsibility for such Taxes shall be based on the actual revenue and
expenses before and after the Effective Time or if the Tax cannot be
calculated on that basis, then such Taxes shall be pro rated as provided in
(iv) immediately above. Seller shall be responsible for such Taxes that are
attributable to periods before the Effective Time and Buyer shall be
responsible for such Taxes that are attributable to periods from and after
the Effective Time.

  

##### 

  

#### (b) Any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to Ad Valorem Taxes
shall be prepared and timely filed, or caused to be prepared and timely
filed, by the party liable hereunder for the payment of such Taxes, provided,
however, that in the case of any such Tax Return with respect to a Straddle
Period, the Seller shall cause to be prepared and timely filed any Tax Return
required to be filed prior to the Closing Date, and the Buyer shall cause to
be prepared and timely filed any Tax Return that is not required to be filed
until after the Closing Date. If the Buyer or the Seller receives any invoice
for any Ad

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### Valorem Tax which is allocable to any other party in part or in full
hereunder, the recipient shall forward a copy of the invoice promptly to the
other party. In the case of any Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period,
the party responsible for filing such Tax Return shall request the
appropriate reimbursement for the other partys allocable portion of the Ad
Valorem Taxes due, and the party owing such reimbursement shall pay such
reimbursement within the later of the day such Taxes are due or 10 days after
receipt of the reimbursement request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
whenever time permits, each party will make every reasonable effort to
determine each partys appropriate allocable share of any Ad Valorem Tax due
and to pay the allocable share to the party responsible under this paragraph
for paying the Tax in a timely fashion in order to avoid any late payment
penalty.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Seller shall prepare and cause to be filed the combined Texas
franchise Tax Return including the Subs for periods through and including the
Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare and cause to be filed the Texas franchise
Tax Returns of the Subs for periods beginning after the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Except as set forth in _Section 19.11.5(b)_ and  _(c)_ , Buyer
shall prepare and cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for the Subs
relating solely to periods commencing after the Closing Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) Except as set forth in _Sections 19.11.5(b)_ , _(c)_ and  _(d)_
and consistent with _Section 19.11.5(a)_, Seller shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns of or which
include any of the Subs that are required to be filed (after giving effect to
any valid extension of time in which to make such filing). Seller shall cause
the Subs to timely pay all Taxes shown due on Tax Returns described in this
_Section 19.11.5(e)_. However, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any Taxes on
such Tax Returns for which Buyer is responsible under _Section 19.11.5(a)_
within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving a copy of the Tax Return and
the calculation of Buyers share of Taxes from Seller. Further, Buyer and
Seller may agree in writing for Buyer to prepare and file such other Tax
Returns when in the best interest of both parties.

  

#### 

  

#### (f) All Tax Returns described in _Section 19.11.5_ for taxable periods
ending on or before or which include the Closing Date shall be prepared in a
manner reasonably consistent with past practice unless a past practice has
been finally determined to be incorrect by the applicable Taxing Authority or
a contrary treatment is required by applicable Tax laws (or the judicial or
administrative interpretations thereof).

  

#### 

  

#### (g) Seller will provide Buyer with copies of all Tax Returns (other than
the consolidated federal income tax return and the combined Texas franchise
tax return of Seller and the Subs) described in _Section 19.11.5(e)_
and filed after the Closing Date at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to
the filing date. Buyer shall be provided an opportunity to review such
returns and all supporting workpapers, schedules and information, and to
propose changes, not later than ten

  



        
   

  

#### 

  

#### (10) Business Days prior to the filing date of such Tax Returns. Seller
shall make such revisions to the Tax Returns as are reasonably and properly
requested by Buyer, provided that such changes do not increase the Tax
liability of Seller or the Subs. The failure of Buyer to propose any changes
to any such Tax Returns prior to the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day
period shall be deemed to be an indication of their approval thereof. The
Seller shall have the same rights with respect to any Tax Returns prepared by
Buyer for any Straddle Period.

  

#### 

  

### 19.11.6 _Certain Other Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, if any,
shall be paid by Seller when due, and Seller shall file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to any such transfer Taxes, and,
if required by Applicable Law, Buyer will, and will cause Subs to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation and
will cooperate with Seller to take such commercially reasonable actions as
will minimize or reduce the amount of such Taxes.

  

### 

  

### 19.11.7 _Tax Audits_.

  

### 

  

#### (a) Except for Ad Valorem Taxes as set forth in _Sections 19.11.5(a)_
and  _(b)_ : Seller shall have the sole right (but not the obligation) to
represent the interests of the Subs in any audit or administrative or court
proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") relating to Taxes for taxable periods of
the Subs which end on or before the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense. Buyer agrees that, at Sellers cost, it will cooperate
fully, and shall cause the Subs to cooperate fully, with Seller and its
counsel in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any
said proceeding.

  

#### 

  

#### (b) Seller at its sole cost has the right, but not the obligation, to
jointly represent the interests of the Subs with the Buyer in any Tax
Proceeding relating to Taxes for any Straddle Period of the Subs. Any disputes
regarding the conduct or resolution of any such audit or proceeding shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 19.11.8_.

  

#### 

  

#### (c) Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the
Subs in all Tax Proceedings other than Tax Proceedings described in clauses
(a), (b) and (d) of this _Section 19.11.7_.

  

#### 

  

#### (d) Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate or successor of Buyer or any such
Affiliate shall (or shall cause or permit any of the Subs to) amend, refile
or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Sub
with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Seller.

  

#### 

  

#### (e) If any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or
otherwise disputes or affects any Taxes for which Seller is responsible
hereunder, Buyer shall, promptly upon receipt by Buyer and/or the Subs of
notice thereof, inform Seller thereof.

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### 19.11.8 _Resolution of Certain Disputes_. In the event that Seller or
Buyer disputes the application or interpretation of any provision of
_Sections 19.11.5_,  _19.11.7_ and _19.11.12_ hereof, or the amount,
allocation or calculation, payment or reimbursement of Taxes, if any, owed by
such party thereunder, such party shall deliver to the other a statement
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the nature of and/or the dollar amount
of any disagreement so asserted. Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to resolve such dispute within twenty (20) days following the
commencement of such dispute. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve such
dispute within such twenty (20) day period, the dispute shall be resolved by
the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall determine, only with
respect to the specific disagreements submitted in writing by Seller
and Buyer, the manner in which such item or items in dispute should be
resolved; provided, however, that the dollar amount of any such item or items
shall be determined within the range of dollar amounts proposed by Seller, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The Accounting Referee shall be
directed to make such determination promptly, but in no event later than
thirty (30) days after acceptance of its appointment. Any finding by the
Accounting Referee shall be a reasoned award stating the findings of fact and
conclusions of law (if any) on which it is based, shall be final and binding
upon the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the
parties regarding the disputed items so presented. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall be shared by Seller and Buyer (A) in proportion
to each partys respective liability for Taxes which are the subject of the
dispute as determined by the Accounting Referee, or (B) in equal proportions
if the subject of the dispute involves Tax Returns for which no Taxes are
due. The parties shall otherwise bear their own expenses incurred in any
dispute resolution pursuant to this _Section 19.11.8_.

  

### 

  

### 19.11.9 _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any refunds of Taxes (together with
any interest with respect thereto) paid to or in respect of the Subs
(including any amounts credited against income tax to which Buyer, its
Affiliates or any of the Subs becomes entitled) and that relate to Tax
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Effective Time for Ad
Valorem Taxes and the Closing Date for all other Taxes shall be for the
account of Seller. Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the
amount of any such credit (in each case, together with any interest with
respect thereto) within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement
thereto. Any refunds or credits of Taxes (together with any interest with
respect thereto) of the Subs for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between Seller and Buyer consistent with _Section 19.11.5(c)_.  Buyer
shall, if Seller so requests and at Sellers expense, prepare, execute and
file any claims for refunds or credits, or cause the Subs to prepare, execute
and file any claims for refunds or credits, to which Seller is entitled under
this _Section 19.11.9_. Buyer shall permit Seller to control the prosecution
of any such refund at Sellers sole cost.

  

### 

  

### 19.11.10 _Certain Elections_. To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer
shall not permit the Subs to carry back any loss, deduction or credit to any
taxable period that ends on, prior to or which includes the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### 19.11.11 _FIRPTA_. Seller shall furnish to Buyer on or before the Closing
Date a certification of its non-foreign status consistent with
the requirements set forth in Section 1445 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations.

  



        
   

  

### 

  

### 19.11.12 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among
the Properties of the Subs.

  

### 

  

19.12 _Public Announcements_. Except as contemplated by the terms of the
Bidding Procedures and Sale Motion and as required by state or federal
securities Law, the parties hereto hereby agree that prior to making any
public announcement or statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller (on behalf of itself and the Subs) or
Buyer, as applicable, desiring to make such public announcement or statement
shall consult with the other (Seller or Buyer, as applicable), and endeavor
in good faith to obtain the prior written approval of the other to the text
of a public announcement or statement to be made solely by Seller, on the one
hand, or solely by Buyer, on the other, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
anything set forth in this _Section 19.12_ to the contrary, Seller shall not
be required to obtain approval from Buyer before issuing a press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement and filing a Form 8-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the execution of this
Agreement.

  



  

19.13 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding any term or provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any party to this Agreement be
liable for any consequential, special, indirect, incidental, exemplary,
punitive or similar damages or lost profits arising out of or relating to
this Agreement.

  



  

 **19.14 _Jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court; Dispute Resolution; No
Jury_.**

  



  

### **19.14.1 **Without limiting any partys right to appeal any Order of
the Bankruptcy Court, the parties agree that the Bankruptcy Court will have
exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### **19.14.2 **In the event the Bankruptcy Court does not have jurisdiction
over a dispute that arises under this Agreement, or for whatever reason fails
or refuses to take jurisdiction over any other dispute arising hereunder
then, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the parties
hereby agree, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to submit all
controversies, disputes and claims arising hereunder and not otherwise
resolved by the parties in writing to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
appropriate State of Texas court located in Harris County, Texas or, to the
extent permitted by Law, the federal courts in the Southern District of Texas
(to whose jurisdiction the parties hereby irrevocably, unqualifiedly and
unconditionally submit), and to any appellate court from any therefrom, in
any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each party
hereby irrevocably, unqualifiedly and unconditionally agrees that all claims
and Losses in respect of any such dispute may be heard and determined in such
State of Texas court, or to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal
court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably, unqualifiedly and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any
defense of any inconvenient forum or improper venue to the maintenance of any
such dispute in any such court and any right of jurisdiction on account of
its place of residence or domicile. Each of the parties
irrevocably, unqualifiedly and unconditionally consents to the service of any
and all process in any such dispute in such State of Texas or federal court
by the sending of such process to each of the applicable parties at the
addresses and in the manner

  



        
   

  



  

### specified in ** _Section 19.1_**, or as otherwise may be permitted or
required by Applicable Law. Each of the parties agrees that the
final judgment in any such dispute, following exhaustion of all remedies by
appeal, shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  

### 

  

### ** _19.14.3 EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY DISPUTE ARISING HEREUNDER AND CONSENTS TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AS
EVIDENCED BY ITS EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT._**

this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates
(and any Permitted Assignee, including Sabco and Intrepid, if assigned an
