conditions) (such third business day immediately following the date on which
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof is satisfied or
waived, the "Initial Date"). At the election of Parent, the "Closing Date" may
be at any time during the period beginning on the Initial Date through the
date which is seventeen (17) business days after the Initial Date, or such
other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing.

  

  

Section 1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on
the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger or other

a form mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company (acting reasonably),
executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required
by, the relevant provisions of the OGCL, with the Secretary of State of the
State of Ohio and shall make all other filings or recordings required under
the OGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with the OGCL, or at such later time as is agreed by
the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the OGCL (such date and time is hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the OGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers, immunities
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of
the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the OGCL and the other
applicable Laws.

  

  

Section 1.5 Articles and Regulations of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except
with respect to the name of the Company) the articles of incorporation and
code of regulations of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the articles of
incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and
applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in
Section 5.9. For the avoidance of doubt, the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the name of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 1.6 Directors. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub

Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and
code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.7 Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.8 Subsequent Actions. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

TREATMENT OF SHARES

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders
of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.1(b), Section
2.3 and Section 2.4, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares, collectively, "Company Common Stock," and each, a
"Share"), together with the associated preferred share purchase rights (the
"Rights") under the Shareholders Rights Plan shall thereupon be canceled and,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(b), shall be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive cash in the amount of
thirty dollars ($30.00) per share (the "Merger Consideration"), payable
without interest, to the holder of such share of Company Common Stock. As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock and Rights shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate, which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock, shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, to be paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender, in accordance with Section 2.2(b), of the certificate formerly
evidencing such share. Throughout this Agreement, the term "Shares" refers to
the Shares together with the associated Rights.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly,
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation.
No capital stock of the Merger Sub will be issued or used in the Merger.

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Shares.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the
Restricted Shares and Company RSUs, for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in each case in accordance with this Article II. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of all of the foregoing shares an
amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration
deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.4, other than in respect
of Dissenting Shares or shares canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (such cash
amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained hereto, the Paying Agent shall not disburse
any part of the Exchange Fund prior to the Dissenters Determination Date.
Pending its disbursement in satisfaction of such obligations, the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-
term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion. Upon the date that is
one (1) business day after the Dissenters Determination Date, the Paying Agent
shall disburse to Parent that portion of the Exchange Fund (if any)
attributable to Dissenting Shares. If a Dissenting Shareholder effectively
withdraws its demand for, or loses its rights to, payment of fair cash value
pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares,
(i) such Company Common Stock shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent
additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Shareholder has withdrawn its
demand for, or lost its rights to, payment of fair cash value pursuant to
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and (y) the Merger Consideration. Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash
in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
under Section 2.1(a) and Section 2.4. Nothing contained in this Section 2.2(a)
and no investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with
the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common
Stock, the Restricted Shares and Company RSUs, to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock, (i) a certificate or certificates (each, a
"Certificate"), which as of the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, the Restricted Shares or the Company RSUs, that were
canceled or converted and became instead the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or Section 2.4, (ii) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and
which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and
(iii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall, subject to Section
2.3, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration,
without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and (y) the person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without
interest.

  

  

(c) Withholdings. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold,
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable under this Agreement,
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any provision of state, local
or foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person(s) to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books. Subject to Section 2.3, from and after the Effective Time, the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, the Company Stock Options, the Restricted
Shares and Company RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, Company Stock
Options, Restricted Shares or Company RSUs, except as otherwise provided
herein and by applicable Law. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock, the Company Stock Options, the Restricted
Shares and Company RSUs upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock, the Company Stock Options, the Restricted Shares and Company RSUs
previously represented by such Certificates. From and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
the Shares, the Company Stock Options, the Restricted Shares and Company RSUs
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 2.2(d), if,
after the Effective Time, Shares, Company Stock Options, Restricted Shares or
Company RSUs are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

  

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time commencing nine (9) months after
the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including, without limitation, all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby, deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(h) Uncertificated Shares. In the case of outstanding Shares that are not
represented by Certificates, the parties shall make such adjustments to this
Section 2.2 as are necessary or appropriate to implement the same purpose and
effect that this Section 2.2 has with respect to Shares that are represented
by Certificates.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.3 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent required by the OGCL, shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and which are held by any shareholder who was a record holder of Company
Common Stock as to which such shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed
for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting, and who files with the Company within ten (10) days
after such vote at the Company Shareholders' Meeting (the "Dissenters
Determination Date") a written demand to be paid the fair cash value for such
shares of Company Common Stock that have not been voted in favor of the
proposal to adopt this Agreement at the Company Shareholders' Meeting in
accordance with Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), unless and until such shareholder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses such shareholder's
rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If any such
shareholder (a "Dissenting Shareholder") fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses any such rights as a Dissenting Shareholder, that
shareholder's Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into only the right to receive at the
Effective Time the Merger Consideration, without interest. Subject to the
preceding sentence, from and after the Effective Time, each shareholder who
has asserted rights as a Dissenting Shareholder as provided in Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted under those Sections of the OGCL. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of each shareholder who asserts rights as a Dissenting Shareholder
following receipt of such shareholder's written demand delivered as provided
in Section 1701.85(A)(2) of the OGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment or commit or agree to make any payment, or settle or commit or
offer to settle, any rights of a Dissenting Shareholder asserted under Section
1701.85 of the OGCL.

  

  

Section 2.4 Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

  

  

(a) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the
Company (the "Company Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
become fully vested and exercisable. With respect to such Company Stock
Options:

  

  

(i) each Company Stock Option for which, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Share shall be canceled at the
Effective Time and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of such Company
Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than three (3) business days following the Effective Time, an
amount in cash (without interest, and less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment) equal to the product
of (1) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Share under such Company Stock Option and (2) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time for which, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
does not exceed the exercise price per Share shall be amended and converted
into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Stock Option (giving effect to any terms and conditions
resulting from the Transactions), the number of shares of common stock of
Parent, par value $.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), rounded down to the
nearest whole share, equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and the Exchange Ratio (as
defined below), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the
aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an
"Adjusted Option"). The adjustments provided in this Section 2.4(a)(ii) with
respect to any Company Stock Option to which Section 409A or 421 (a) of the
Code applies shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 409A and 424(a) of the Code, respectively. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders
of Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights
pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing
the grants of such Adjusted Options, which shall provide, among other things,
that such Adjusted Options and agreements have been assumed by Parent and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.4(a)(ii) after giving effect to the
Merger and giving effect to any terms and conditions resulting from the
Transactions). For purposes of this Section 2.4(a)(ii), "Exchange Ratio" shall
mean the Merger Consideration divided by the volume weighted average per-share
trading price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the
"NYSE") on the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of restricted Company Common Stock
granted under a Company Stock Plan (including all restricted common shares
granted under the Career Progression Program) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Restricted Shares") shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, less such amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment.

   
 

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan whose vesting is based
solely on the satisfaction of service-based conditions and that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Service-Based
RSUs") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock denominated thereby, less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each performance share unit award in respect of
Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan whose vesting is not
based solely on the satisfaction of service-based conditions and that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Non-
Service-Based RSUs", and together with the Service-Based RSUs, the "Company
RSUs") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
the target number of shares of Company Common Stock denominated by the Non-
Service-Based RSUs multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the applicable performance period elapsed through and
including the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the applicable performance period, less such amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law with respect to the making of such payment.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions to effect
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4.

  

  

(f) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
issuance upon the exercise of the Adjusted Options. The Company shall
cooperate with, and assist Parent in the preparation of, such registration
statement. Parent shall keep such registration statement effective (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus required thereby) for so long as
any Adjusted Options remain outstanding.

  

  

Section 2.5 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction. For the
avoidance of doubt, there shall not be any adjustment to the Merger
Consideration by reason of the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the exercise of the Company's outstanding Warrants or other
convertible securities.

  

  

Section 2.6 Consent of Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation hereby
consents to be sued and served with process in the State of Ohio and to the
irrevocable appointment of the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio as its
agent to accept service of process in any proceeding in the State of Ohio to
enforce against the Surviving Corporation any obligation of the Company, or to
enforce the rights of a Dissenting Shareholder of the Company.

ARTICLE III

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that except (i)
as set forth in the "Company Disclosure Schedule" (as such term is used in
this Agreement), a copy of which has been provided to Parent and Merger Sub,
with specific reference to the particular Article or Section of this Agreement
to which the information set forth in such schedule relates (it being agreed
that disclosure of any item in any Article or Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
Article or Section to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent)
or (ii) as and to the extent set forth in the publicly available reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with, or
furnished by the Company to, the SEC on or after January 1, 2010 and before
the second (2nd) business day immediately prior to the date hereof, to the
extent the relevance of the disclosure is reasonably apparent (excluding any
forward-looking disclosures, whether or not contained under the heading
"forward-looking statements," other than any specific factual information
contained therein):

  

  

Section 3.1 Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, to carry on
its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing, character or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a
true and complete copy of its articles of incorporation and code of
regulations (the "Company Organizational Documents") and has made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the
articles of incorporation and code of regulations or other equivalent
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, each as amended through
the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is in
material violation of any provision of its articles of incorporation or
regulations (or equivalent organizational documents).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Section 3.1(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
list, as of the date hereof, of each Subsidiary of the Company and its
jurisdiction of organization or formation and the jurisdictions in which they
are qualified to do business. Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth each of the Company's Subsidiaries and the ownership
interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership
interest of any other person or persons in each such Subsidiary. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company,
by one or more Subsidiaries of the Company or by the Company and one or more
Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except
for Company Permitted Liens. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, except for the capital stock and other equity
interests of its Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity interest in
any other person (including through participation in any joint venture or
similar arrangement), other than the ownership of securities primarily for
investment purposes as part of routine cash management or investments of two
percent (2%) or less in publicly traded companies, and there are no Company
Joint Ventures. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any minority
interest in any person that requires an additional filing by the Parent under
the HSR Act in connection with the consummation of the Transactions. "Company
Joint Venture" means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company
and in which (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, owns or controls any
shares of any class of the outstanding voting securities or other equity
interests (other than the ownership of securities primarily for investment
purposes as part of routine cash management or investments of two percent (2%)
or less in publicly traded companies) or (ii) the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company is a general partner.

  

  

(c) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has made available to the Parent
true, complete and correct copies of the approved minutes of all meetings of
the shareholders, the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company since January 1, 2009 through January 25, 2011.
Parent acknowledges that certain provisions of such minutes relating to the
Company's strategic alternatives have been omitted.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) As used in this Agreement, a "Company Material Adverse Effect" means an
event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, is or would reasonably be expected to
be materially adverse to the business, financial condition, assets,

any material loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, lease, agreement, contract, instrument,
permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon the Company or

of the foregoing (A) through (D), a "Company Permitted Lien"), upon any of the

Section 3.4 SEC Reports, Financial Statements and Utility Reports.

  

  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 2010 (the
"Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC or its staff.
There has been no material correspondence between the SEC and the Company
since March 18, 2011 that is not available on the SEC's Electronic Data
Gathering and Retrieval database. As of the date of this Agreement, other than
The Dayton Power and Light Company ("DPandL"), none of the Company's
Subsidiaries is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) under the Exchange Act.

  

  

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and all such required certifications
have been made. The Company's management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has
identified or been made aware of "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in
the design or operation of the Company's internal controls and procedures
which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, in each case which
has not been subsequently remediated.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules)
of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in
all material respects with the rules and regulations of the SEC then in
effect, fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the
respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject,
in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring year-end audit
adjustments that were not or are not expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to the Company), and were prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

  

  

(d) Prior to the date of the Agreement, the Company has made available to
Parent copies of the following financial statements, in each case together
with the exhibits, schedules and notes thereto and any affirmations and
certifications filed therewith: the audited annual financial statements of
Miami Valley Insurance Company (the "Captive Insurer"), as filed with the
Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and Health Care
Administration (the "Vermont Department"), as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 (the "Captive Insurer Financial Statements"). The
Captive Insurer Financial Statements (1) were derived from and are consistent
in all material respects with the books and records of the Captive Insurer,
(2) were prepared in all material respects with all applicable Laws and GAAP,
applied in each case on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (3) fairly present, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Captive Insurer at the
dates thereof and the results of operations, capital and surplus of the
Captive Insurer for the periods then ended and (4) were prepared in compliance
with the internal control procedures of the Captive Insurer and/or Parent. No
material deficiency has been asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to any of the Captive Insurer Financial Statements.

  

  

(e) The liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of the
Captive Insurer recorded in the Captive Insurer Financial Statements, as of
their respective dates: (1) have been computed in accordance with presently
accepted actuarial standards consistently applied and were fairly stated, in
accordance with sound actuarial principles and (2) have complied in all
material respects with applicable Law and regulatory requirements of the
Vermont Department.

  

  

(f) All filings (other than immaterial filings) required to be made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2009, with the FERC under
the FPA or the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, the North American
Electric Reliability Corporation, the Department of Energy, any regional
transmission organization and the PUCO under applicable Law, as the case may
be, have been made, including all forms, statements, reports, agreements and
all documents, exhibits, amendments and supplements appertaining thereto,
including all rates, tariffs, franchises, service agreements and related
documents, and all such filings complied, as of their respective dates, with
all applicable requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except for filings the failure of which to make or the
failure of which to make in compliance with all applicable requirements of
applicable statutes and the rules and regulations thereunder, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet arrangement" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates.

  

  

(h) The proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Company Shareholders' Meeting (including any amendment or
supplement thereto or document incorporated by reference therein) (the "Proxy
Statement") shall not, (i) on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
shareholders of the Company, or (ii) at the time of the Company Shareholders'
Meeting or (iii) on the date the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC,
contain any statement which, at the time and in the light of the circumstances
under which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Company Shareholders' Meeting or subject matter which has
become false or misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement.

liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31, 2010 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether or not accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, that would be

those which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

To the knowledge of the Company, no third party is infringing,

Section 3.20 Material Contracts. Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract that (i) is a
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC), (ii) would, after giving effect to the Merger,
materially limit or restrict the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or any successor thereto, from engaging or competing in any line
of business or in any geographic area that it currently engages in or that
contains exclusivity or non-solicitation provisions with respect to customers,
(iii) limits or otherwise restricts the ability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to its shareholders or
(iv) provides for the operation or management of any material operating assets
of the Company or its Subsidiaries by any person other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Each Contract of the type described in this Section 3.20,
whether or not set forth on Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule is
referred to herein as a "Company Material Contract." Each Company Material
Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or its Subsidiary
party thereto enforceable against the Company or its Subsidiary party thereto
and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, in accordance
with its terms (except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought) and, is in full
force and effect, and each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries which
is a party thereto has performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it to the date hereof under each Company Material
Contract and, to the knowledge of the Company, each other party to each
Company Material Contract has performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under such Company Material
Contract, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of, or has
received written notice of, any violation of or default under (or any
condition which with the passage of time or the giving of written notice would
cause such a violation of or default under) any Company Material Contract to
which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is
bound, except for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or, after giving effect to the Merger, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. "Contract" or "contract" means any written agreement, undertaking,
contract, commitment, lease, license, permit, franchise, concession, deed of
trust, contract, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other

take any other action, if such contract, amendment of a contract or action
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger or the Transactions; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(xxiv) General. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its

advance notice, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, to
all of its available employees, properties, books, contracts and records
(including, but not limited to, Tax Returns) and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to Parent or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
Representative, (i) access to each report, schedule and other document filed
or received by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws or filed with or sent to the
SEC, FERC, the DOJ, the FTC, the PUCO or any other federal or state regulatory
agency or commission and (ii) access to all information concerning the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives
in connection with any filings, applications or approvals required or
contemplated by this Agreement, but only to the extent that such access does
not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and, to the extent required by applicable Law, access to
personnel records will be provided only if authorized by the specific
employees); provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing
access and the disclosure of information to the extent that (i) in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, any Law applicable to the Company requires
the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Company, the
information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party, (iii)
such disclosure would result in disclosure of any trade secrets or
confidential strategic analyses and evaluations of the Company or of third
parties or (iv) disclosure of any such information or document could result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company and/or its
counsel shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such
joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow
for such disclosure in a manner that does not result in the loss of attorney
client privilege); provided further, however, that with respect to clauses (i)
through (iv) of this Section 5.2(a), the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent of such third party to
provide such access or disclosure or (B) develop an alternative to providing
such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable
to Parent and the Company; provided further, however, that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein. Parent agrees to
indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any and all
claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses for loss, injury to or
death of any director, officer, employee or Representative of Parent, and any
damage to or destruction of any property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or others (including claims or liabilities for loss of use of any
property) resulting from the action of any of the directors, officers,
employees or Representatives of Parent (other than as directed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or Representatives) during any visit to the business or property
sites of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, whether
pursuant to this Section 5.2 or otherwise. During any visit to the business or
property sites of the Company or any of its Company Subsidiaries, Parent
shall, and shall cause its affiliates, officers, directors, employees or
Representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable laws
and all of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' safety and security procedures
and conduct itself in a manner that would not be reasonably expected to
interfere with the operation, maintenance or repair of the assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Access shall be provided for site inspections in
accordance with the conditions and procedures of this Section 5.2, but
Parent's affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives shall
not conduct any environmental sampling, monitoring, probing, excavation or
other invasive actions.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions shall be deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as such term is used
in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of July 30, 2010, between the Company and AES North American
Development, LLC (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

Section 5.3 Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective officers and directors shall, and that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, seek or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information)
any inquiries or the making or submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) in connection
with or in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person (other than
Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or other agreement providing
for any Company Acquisition Transaction (except as contemplated by Section
7.1(h)); provided, however, that this Section 5.3 shall not prohibit (A) the
Company, or the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly
through any affiliate, director, officer, employee or Representative, prior to
the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, from furnishing nonpublic
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or entering
into or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any person in
response to (x) an unsolicited, written Company Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could
reasonably lead to a Company Superior Offer or (y) an unsolicited inquiry
relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal by a person that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines is credible and reasonably capable of
making a Company Superior Offer (an "Inquiry"), if (1) such Company
Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry did not result from a breach of this Section
5.3(a) (other than any such breach that is unintentional and immaterial in
effect), (2) the Company gives to Parent the notice required by Section 5.3(b)
and (3) the Company furnishes any nonpublic information provided to the maker
of the Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry only pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement between the Company and such person on terms no less
favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided, that
such confidentiality agreement shall not in any way restrict the Company from
complying with its disclosure obligations under this Agreement, including with
respect to such proposal), and such furnished information is delivered
promptly to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished or made available by the Company to Parent) or (B) the Company from
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to any
Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that compliance with such
rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken
pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement and in
no event shall the Company or the Company's Board of Directors or a committee
thereof take any action that would constitute a Company Change of
Recommendation in respect of a Company Acquisition Proposal other than in
compliance with Section 5.3(c).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than 48 hours, after its
receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with a Company Acquisition Proposal, advise Parent orally and in writing of
such Company Acquisition Proposal or request, including providing the identity
of the person making or submitting such Company Acquisition Proposal or
request, and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy of such Company Acquisition
Proposal and any related draft agreements and (y) if oral, a reasonably
detailed summary of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects on a
prompt basis with respect to the status of, including any change to the status
or material terms of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(c) Except as contemplated by this Section 5.3(c), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or resolve to or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent, (B) following the date any Company Acquisition Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first made public, sent or given to the
shareholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release that expressly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation within five (5) business days following
Parent's written request to do so (which request may only be made once with
respect to any such Company Acquisition Proposal and each material
modification thereto) or (C) approve, adopt or recommend any Company
Acquisition Proposal (each such action set forth in clauses (A) through (C)
above being a "Company Change of Recommendation") or (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, a merger
agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar contract (other than the confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.3(a)) or any tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in
connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, in respect of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (i) make a Company Change of Recommendation and/or (ii)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h) of this Agreement, if and
only if: (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company by a third
party, and such offer is not withdrawn; (B) the Company's Board of Directors
determines after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such offer constitutes a Company Superior Offer and (C) the
Company Board of Directors has provided to Parent five (5) business days prior
written notice of its intent to take such action (which notice shall include
the reasonable details regarding the cause for, and nature of, the Company
Change of Recommendation) and, if requested by Parent, negotiated in good
faith with Parent during such five (5) business day period regarding revisions
to this Agreement which would avoid such Company Change of Recommendation
and/or termination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

The Board of Directors of the Company may not, in respect of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, make a Company Change of Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent except in compliance in all respects with this Section
5.3(c)and Section 7.1(h). For the avoidance of doubt, a change of the Company
Recommendation to "neutral" is a Company Change of Recommendation.

  

  

(d) As used in this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any bona fide offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest received from a third party (other than an

Agreement) relating to any Company Acquisition Transaction;

  

  

(ii) "Company Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of
transactions involving: (a) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company other than the Transactions; (b) any direct or indirect acquisition of

assets that constitute or account for twenty percent (20%) or more of the

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (d) any liquidation or dissolution of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

  

  

(iii) "Company Superior Offer" shall mean a Company Acquisition Proposal
(provided that for purposes of this definition, references to twenty percent
(20%) in the definition of Company Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to
be references to fifty percent (50%)) that the Company's Board of Directors
determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory
terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal (including any
conditions to and expected timing of consummation and, any risks of non-
consummation of such Company Acquisition Proposal) to be more favorable to the
Company and its shareholders (in their capacity as shareholders) as compared
to the Transactions, including the Merger, and to any alternative transaction
(including any modifications to the terms of this Agreement) proposed by
Parent.

Section 5.4 Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders' Meeting.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than 60 days), the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of the preliminary Proxy
Statement and the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Company will respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments or requests of the SEC on the preliminary Proxy Statement and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company's shareholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be
reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all information concerning itself
that is required or customary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The
information provided by any party for use in or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement shall be true and correct, in all material respects, at
the dates mailed to the Company's shareholders and at the time of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting, without omission of any material fact that is required
to make such information not false or misleading. Except for annual, quarterly
and current reports filed or furnished with the SEC under the Exchange Act,
which may be incorporated by reference therein (but subject to Section 5.8),
no filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made
by the Company without Parent's prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without providing Parent the opportunity
to review and comment thereon. The Company will advise Parent promptly after
it receives oral or written notice of any oral or written request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide
Parent with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state
securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. No
representation, covenant or agreement is made by any party hereto with respect
to information supplied by any other party for inclusion on the Proxy
Statement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company shall promptly take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to duly give notice
of, a meeting of its shareholders to be held as promptly as practicable to
consider the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Transactions
including the Merger (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting"). Unless there shall
have been a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Company will, through its Board of Directors, convene and
hold the Company Shareholders' Meeting, recommend that its shareholders adopt
this Agreement and approve the Transactions, including the Merger, and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Transactions, including the Merger, and to take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of its shareholders required by the
rules of the NYSE or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

  

  

(c) The Company shall take all action necessary to comply timely with
applicable notification requirements under applicable Law in respect of any
Company Benefit Plan holding Company Common Stock, including causing any
Company Benefit Plan administrator to issue any such notices.

"Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each current and former Company Employee, other than such employees covered
by collective bargaining agreements, compensation and employee benefits
(exclusive of equity-based compensation or benefits) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to
current and former Company Employees (as the case may be) immediately before
the Effective Time; provided, that Parent shall be entitled to make
modifications thereto to the extent such modifications do not result in
compensation and benefits for the Company Employees not covered by collective
bargaining agreements that are less favorable in the aggregate than that which
is then provided to similarly situated employees of Parent not covered by
collective bargaining agreements; provided, further, that nothing herein shall
prohibit Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment
of any Company Employee to the extent permitted by applicable Laws; and
provided, further, that, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5(a), (i) during
the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending December 31, 2013,
Parent shall cause The Dayton Power and Light Retirement Income Plan to remain
in effect in respect of Company Employees (exclusive of those employed subject
to a collective bargaining agreement) hired before January 1, 2011 and
participating therein immediately before the Effective Time on terms and
conditions no less favorable than those in effect immediately before the
Effective Time and (ii) if benefit accruals in respect of such Company
Employees are reduced or eliminated under The Dayton Power and Light
Retirement Income Plan after December 31, 2013, such Company Employees shall
be fully vested in their benefit accrued under such plan as of the effective
time of such reduction or elimination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and accrual and level
of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "New
Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited for his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits or to benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) Parent shall cause each Company
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Benefit Plan set forth on Section 3.12(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans") and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

  

(c) With respect to any employee actively employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries at the Effective Time whose terms and conditions of employment
are governed by the Compact by and between the Company and Local 175, Utility
Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO (the "Compact") (each, a "Represented
Employee"), Parent agrees to honor or cause to be honored the Compact in
effect as of the Effective Time and to continue all terms and conditions of
employment applicable to such Represented Employee under their respective
collective bargaining agreements through the expiration, modification or
termination of such agreements in conformity with applicable Law.

  

  

(d) The Company shall adopt a retention program for key employees prior to the
Closing in accordance with Section 5.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(e) If and to the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Closing, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay, when such payments
would have been due in the ordinary course, to each person who, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to and participated in the
Company's annual bonus plans with respect to fiscal year 2011 (each an
"Eligible Company Employee"), the amount earned and payable to such Eligible
Company Employee for the performance period ending December 31, 2011,
determined in accordance with the individual and other performance targets
established under such plans in respect of such period, adjusted for costs
incurred by the Company in connection with the Transactions.

  

  

(f) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending December 31,
2013, Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to implement any
involuntary workforce reductions that would result in the Company and its
Subsidiaries employing substantially fewer individuals in the aggregate than
they employed (exclusive of officers and management employees of the Company
who are covered by change in control agreements) immediately before the
Effective Time; provided, that, the requirements of this sentence shall not
apply if a material adverse effect on the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective material assets shall have occurred
and is continuing; and, provided, further, that, for avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall prohibit Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of or their
respective Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of any Company
Employee to the extent permitted by applicable Laws.

Section 5.6 Regulatory Approvals; Third-Party Consents; Reasonable Best
Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals, including the Company Approvals and the Parent
Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, but in any event within thirty (30)
days, use reasonable best efforts to (i) make all necessary filings and
thereafter make any other required submissions in respect of each of the
Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, (ii) cooperate with each other in
(A) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained
from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all
such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) subject to Section
5.6(d), take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be
done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including taking all such further action as may be
necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FERC, the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the PUCO, the SEC, the FCC, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or
competition authorities of any other nation may assert under Regulatory Law
with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date),
including (A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition
or limitation on usage of such assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (B)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Parent's or its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving
Corporation's) or its affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries' (including
the Surviving Corporation's) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case
as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the Closing, (C) taking or committing to take actions to
maintain the credit rating of DPandL at investment grade levels, (D) accepting
financial restrictions on Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or on the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (E) accepting governance and operational
restrictions, including restrictions on the scope of the business of Parent or
its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
taking or committing to take actions related to customary "ring-fencing" at
the Company and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any third party or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Transactions. The Company and Parent will include in their
applications filed for approval with the PUCO their intention to (i) use
customary ring-fencing protection at the Company with respect to the
Transactions and (ii) reasonably provide for Company officials in Ohio related
to the resolution of consumer disputes. The Company and Parent shall permit
counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company
and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the proposed Transactions unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as violative
of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) give the other
party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of any such
action or proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to any
of the Transactions, (ii) keep the other party informed as to the status of
any such action or proceeding or threat thereof and (iii) cooperate in all
respects with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, "reasonable
best efforts" shall not require, any party to sell, or agree to sell, hold or
agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose or agree to dispose of any asset,
or conduct or agree to conduct its business in any particular manner, agree to
or accept any condition or take any other action, as may be required to
resolve objections if any, of the FERC, the FTC, the PUCO or the DOJ, in each
case if such sale, separation or disposition, agreement, conduct or action
with respect thereto would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have, (x) for the Company, a Company Material Adverse Effect or
(y) for Parent, a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition, assets, liabilities, operations or results of operations of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and
the terms and conditions of the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals
(provided that for the purpose of determining whether a potential adverse
effect on the Parent and its Subsidiaries would constitute a material adverse
effect for the purposes of this Section 5.6, Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities of
the size and scale of a hypothetical company that is 100% of the size and
scale of the Company, together with each of its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole). The Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries will consult
with each other prior to agreeing to any merger requirements sought by any
regulator. Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall obligate Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action that is not
conditioned on the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into a
definitive agreement to acquire (i) any regulated electric or gas distribution
utility in the State of Ohio, other than the Transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, that would present a material risk of materially delaying or making
it materially more difficult for the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to
obtain the approval of the PUCO with respect to the Transactions contemplated
in this Agreement, or (ii) significant electric generation assets of clearly
sufficient magnitude in the relevant market, that would present a material
risk of materially delaying or making it materially more difficult for the
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to obtain the approval of FERC with respect
to the Transactions contemplated in this Agreement (any such acquisition, a
"Contrary Action").

  

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act of 1890
as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 as amended, the HSR Act, the
FPA, the Atomic Energy Act, the rules and regulations of the PUCO and all
other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to (i)
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition or (ii) protect the national security or the economy of any
nation.

  

  

Section 5.7 Takeover Statute; Shareholder Rights Plan. If any Takeover Law may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of the
Company and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions. If
any takeover plan or agreement may become, or purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, the Company shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such plan or agreement on the
Transactions.

  

  

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. Except with respect to a Company Change of
Recommendation or any action taken by the Company or Parent or their Boards of
Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.3 (or in response
thereto), so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press
release or making any public announcement relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions and, except for any press release or public announcement as may
be required by applicable Law, court process or any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange, shall use reasonable efforts not to issue any
such press release or make any such public announcement without consulting the
other parties. Parent and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable
initial joint press release announcing this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
codes of regulations or other organization documents or in any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which rights shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent
permitted by Law. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Company's and any of the Company's Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation or
codes of regulations or similar organization documents in effect as of the
date hereof or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective
Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim. At the Effective Time Parent assumes, becomes jointly and
severally liable for, and will honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of Parent to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this Section 5.9 without limit as to time.

  

  

(b) Without limitation to the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer
and employee of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and each person who
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such
person's heirs, executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party") against
any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement (provided that any Action may only be settled with the prior
written consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld) in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "Action"),
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
relating to their position with the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring or
alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such persons approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and serving as an officer, director or other
fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company). In the event of any such Action, (i) the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to select its own counsel, which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under the business
corporation law of the Surviving Corporation's state of incorporation and the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only
one law firm with respect to each related matter except to the extent there
is, in the opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between
positions of such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified Party or
Indemnified Parties. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each cooperate
with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained (on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
indemnified parties) in effect the coverage provided by the policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
in effect as of the Closing Date maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time
either through the Company's existing insurance provider or another provider
reasonably selected by Parent; provided, however, that, after the Effective
Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such
case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount; provided further, however, that in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, Parent may direct the Company to purchase "tail" insurance coverage
(on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the indemnified parties), at
a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which the Surviving Corporation
would be permitted to spend during the six-year period provided for in this
Section 5.9(c), that provides coverage no materially less favorable than the
coverage described above.

  

  

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this Section 5.9.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the articles of restatement or bylaws or other organization documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the OGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this
Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 5.10 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's operations prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

  

  

Section 5.11 Transition Committee. On or following the date hereof, the
Company and Parent shall form a transition committee ("Transition Committee")
comprised of three members appointed by Parent and two members appointed by
the Company, which Transition Committee shall be tasked with monitoring
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, liaising with the Company\'s
management team regarding the Transactions and making recommendations to the
parties with respect to certain decisions that may be required in advance of
the Closing. The Transition Committee will meet as often as its members deem
is necessary (but in any event at least two times per month) and upon the call
of either party. The Transition Committee will have access, consistent with
the terms of this Agreement, to Company personnel and records; provided,
however, that the Transition Committee will neither direct nor interfere with
the day to day management or operations of the business of the Company.

  

  

Section 5.12 Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt written notice to the
other (and will subsequently keep the other informed on a current basis of any
developments related to such notice) upon its becoming aware of the occurrence
or existence of any fact, event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to
result in any of the conditions set forth in Article VI not being able to be
satisfied prior to the End Date.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, of any actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or its Subsidiaries
which relate to this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
this Agreement and the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Section 5.13 Financing.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the sole
expense of the Parent use its and their reasonable best efforts to provide
such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by the Parent in connection
with the financing of the Transactions, if any, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause appropriate officers and employees to be available,
on a customary and reasonable basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with
ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors in presentations,
meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions, (ii) provide reasonable
assistance with the preparation of any ratings presentations, information
memos, offering memoranda or other marketing and disclosure documents and
customary information in connection therewith, including the preparation of
appropriate discussions of business, financial statements, pro forma
financials, projections, management discussion and analysis, and other
customary financial data of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all for use in
connection therewith and an audit of the financial statements in accordance
with GAAP and applicable Law by independent certified public accountants,
(iii) provide any financing sources with reasonable access to the properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, execute and deliver any
customary certificates, authorization letters, pledge or security documents or
other customary definitive financing documents and related documents and
certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Parent and (iv) direct its
independent accountants and counsel to provide customary and reasonable
assistance to the Parent including in connection with providing customary
comfort letters and opinions of counsel; provided, that the actions
contemplated in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) do not (A) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be
breached, (C) cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article VI to fail
to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement, (D) require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any out-of-pocket fees or
expenses prior to the Closing that are not promptly reimbursed by the Parent
as set forth in Section 5.13(b), (E) involve any binding commitment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which commitment is not conditioned on the
Closing and does not terminate without liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement or (F) cause any director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any
personal liability.

  

  

(b) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by Section 5.13(a) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of financing and any information used in connection
therewith. The provisions of this Section 5.13(b) shall survive (i) any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and (ii) the
consummation of the Merger, and are expressly intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parent expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon the Parent or
Merger Sub obtaining any financing. The failure, for any reason, of the Parent
and the Merger Sub to have sufficient cash available on the Closing Date to
pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II hereof and/or the
failure to so pay the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date shall
constitute a willful and material breach of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.14 Company's Credit Facilities and Maturing Debt.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain consents or waivers from the lenders with respect to credit facilities
and letter of credit facilities of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
containing change in control provisions so as to permit the consummation of
the Merger; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to make
any payment in connection with securing such consents or waivers unless Parent
agrees to make any such payment on behalf of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary of the Company
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (including offering
the lenders who commit to any refinancing of credit facilities or other
outstanding indebtedness contemplated by Section 5.14(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule the opportunity to be underwriters in any such
refinancing) to take or cause to be taken the actions set forth on Section
5.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, that the Company or the
relevant Subsidiary of the Company may only amend, restate or refinance a
credit facility or other outstanding indebtedness pursuant to this Section
5.14(b) after giving Parent a reasonable opportunity to review in advance the
terms of such amendment, restatement or refinancing and considering in good
faith Parent's reasonable views of such terms. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed in all material respects on a reasonably prompt basis with
respect to the status of, including any change to the status or material terms
of, the actions set forth on Section 5.14(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. In connection with taking the actions set forth on Section 5.14(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company or the relevant Subsidiary of
the Company shall, in connection with any amendment, restatement or
refinancing, use its reasonable best efforts to concurrently secure, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, fully executed consents, waivers or other
approvals from sufficient lenders under each such amended, restated or
refinanced credit facility or other outstanding indebtedness, such that the

change of control, put, call, acceleration, default, event of default,
termination event or other similar consequence under any such amended,
restated or refinanced credit facility or other outstanding indebtedness;
provided, that the Company shall not be required to make any payment in

withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall

as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59

the Transactions, including the Merger) at or prior to the Effective Time, and
such approvals shall have become Final Orders and (ii) such Final Orders of
the FERC, the FTC, the DOJ or the PUCO shall not impose terms or conditions
that would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have,
(x) for the Company, a Company Material Adverse Effect or, (y) for Parent, a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, assets,
liabilities, operations or results of operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger and the
terms and conditions of the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals
(provided that for the purpose of determining whether a potential adverse
effect on the Parent and its Subsidiaries would constitute a material adverse
effect for the purposes of this Section 6.3, Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities of
the size and scale of a hypothetical company that is 100% of the size and

the Merger, or terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Transactions,
including the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth in Section(s)
6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party's material breach of any material provision of this
Agreement or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Transactions, including the Merger, as required by and subject to Section 5.6.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 7.1 Termination or Abandonment. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after any approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date
hereof (the "End Date"), provided, however, that if all of the conditions to
Closing shall have been satisfied or shall be then capable of being satisfied
(other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) and Section 6.3(e)),
the End Date may be extended by Parent or the Company from time to time by
written notice to the other party up to a date not beyond an additional three
(3) months after the original End Date, the latest of any of which dates shall
thereafter be deemed to be the End Date; and if the End Date (as it may be
extended pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall occur during any Final Order
Waiting Period, the End Date shall be extended until the twentieth (20th)
business day after the expiration of such Final Order Waiting Period);
provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to a party if the failure of the Closing
to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of such party to perform or
comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth in this Agreement, which in the case of Parent, shall include
any Contrary Action by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) by either the Company or Parent if any Restraint having any of the effects
set forth in Section 6.1(b) shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
prevent the entry of and to remove such Restraint;

  

  

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the Company Shareholders' Meeting
(including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and
the Company Shareholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have
been obtained; provided, however, that the right to terminate under this
Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to the Company where the failure to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval shall have been caused by or related
to the Company's material breach of this Agreement;

  

  

(e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section
6.2 and (ii) is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written
notice contemplated by the proviso below in this Section 7.1(e) or cannot be
cured by the End Date, provided, that the Company shall have given Parent
written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination
(but no later than the expected Closing Date), stating the Company's intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) and the basis for
such termination;

  

  

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section
6.3 and (ii) is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written
notice contemplated by the proviso below in this Section 7.1(f) or cannot be
cured by the End Date, provided, that Parent shall have given the Company
written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination
(but no later than the expected Closing Date), stating Parent's intention to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) and the basis for
such termination;

  

  

(g) by Parent, in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective directors or officers shall have breached in any material
respect adverse to Parent any of their respective obligations under Section
5.3;

  

  

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, in order to enter into a written definitive agreement for a Company
Superior Offer, if the Company has complied with its obligations under Section
5.3(c); provided, however, that any such purported termination by the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.1(h) shall be void and of no force or effect unless
the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 7.2; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(i) by Parent, if there has been a Company Change of Recommendation.

  

  

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall terminate (except for the provisions of Sections 5.13(b),
7.2, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6), and there shall be no other liability on the part
of the Company or Parent to the other except under such provisions, or for
liability arising out of fraud or intentional or material breach of this
Agreement or as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement, in which case
the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at
law or in equity.

  

  

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination.

(A) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(i) or (B) the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(h) or (ii) (A) if this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and the breach or other circumstance giving
rise to such termination was willful, or by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d), (B) prior to any such termination, any
person (other than Parent or its affiliates) shall have made a Company
Acquisition Proposal which shall have been publicly announced or disclosed (or
any person shall have publicly announced a bona fide intention, whether or not
conditional, to make a Company Acquisition Proposal) and (C) within twelve
(12) months after such termination of this Agreement, the Company shall have
entered into an agreement to consummate, or shall have consummated, a Company
Acquisition Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company
Termination Fee. Any Company Termination Fee shall be paid to Parent by the
Company in immediately available funds (x) upon termination of this Agreement
in the case of a termination pursuant to clause (i)(B) above, (y) within five
(5) business days after termination in the case of a termination pursuant to
clause (i)(A) above and (z) upon the execution of or entrance into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Transaction in the
case of a termination pursuant to clause (ii) above.

  

  

(b) As used in this Agreement, "Company Termination Fee" shall mean
$106,000,000; provided, however, that (i) if this Agreement is terminated by
the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h) in connection with the execution by the
Company of a written definitive agreement for a Company Superior Offer with an
Excluded Party, the "Company Termination Fee" shall mean $53,000,000.
"Excluded Party" means a person from whom the Company received during the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending at 11:59 p.m., New

that the Board of Directors of the Company concluded in good faith during the
48-hour period commencing upon the expiration of the Initial Period, after
consultation with its financial and outside legal counsel, constitutes or
could reasonably lead to a Company Superior Proposal and promptly provides
written notification to Parent of the same; provided that a person that is an
Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party upon the earliest of: (A)
11:59 p.m. on the date that is fifteen (15) days after the expiration of the
Initial Period; (B) the withdrawal, termination or expiration of such Company
Acquisition Proposal; or (C) the time as of which such Company Acquisition
Proposal, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole
discretion, no longer constitutes, or could not reasonably lead to a Company
Superior Offer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) Upon payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 7.2, the Company shall have no further liability to the Parent or its
shareholders with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions; provided,
that nothing herein shall release any party from liability for intentional
breach or fraud. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

Section 8.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

Section 8.11 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder except (i) as specifically provided in
Section 5.9 and Section 5.13(b), (ii) that the Company shall have the right to
pursue damages on behalf of its shareholders in the event of Parent or Merger
Sub\'s breach or wrongful termination of this Agreement, which right is hereby
acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub and (iii) any financing sources shall be
direct and irrevocable third party beneficiaries of the agreements and
covenants contained in Section 8.5 and Section 8.6.

  

  

Section 8.12 Amendments; Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that after
receipt of Company Shareholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall
by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE
require further approval of the shareholders of the Company, the effectiveness
of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the
shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.13 Obligations of the Parent and of the Company. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires the Merger Sub to take any
action, such requirements shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the
part of the Parent to cause the Merger Sub to take such action.

or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall

statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.
