</FONT><U>Insurance Policies</U>. Steuben and each of its Subsidiaries maintains in full force and effect insurance policies and
bonds in such amounts and against such liabilities and hazards of the types and amounts as (i)&nbsp;it reasonably believes to
be adequate for its business and operations and the value of its properties and (ii)&nbsp;are comparable to those maintained by
other banking organizations of similar size and complexity. Section&nbsp;3.2(s) of the Steuben Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and complete list of all such insurance policies. Neither Steuben nor any of its Subsidiaries is now liable for, nor has
any such member received notice of, any material retroactive premium adjustment. Steuben and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
in all material respects with their insurance policies and are not in Default under any of the terms thereof, each such policy
is in full force and effect, none of Steuben or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a material premium increase
or involuntary cancellation with respect to any of its insurance policies or bonds and, except for policies insuring against potential
liabilities of officers, directors and employees of Steuben and its Subsidiaries, Steuben or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole
beneficiary of any such policy, and all premiums and other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder
have been filed in due and timely fashion. Within the last three (3) years, none of Steuben or any of its Subsidiaries has been
refused any basic insurance coverage sought or applied for (other than certain exclusions for coverage of certain events or circumstances
as stated in such policies), and Steuben has no reason to believe that its existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and
when the same shall expire, upon terms and conditions standard in the market at the time renewal is sought as favorable as those
presently in effect.</P>
