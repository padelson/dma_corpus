AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 16,
2017 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), among MOCON, Inc., a Minnesota corporation
(the " _Company_ "), AMETEK, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
AMETEK Atom, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are
referred to herein as a " _Par_ _ty_ " and together as "Parties".

 



 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the Surviving Company (the " _Merger_ " and together
with the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, collectively, the
" _Transactions_ "), in accordance with the Minnesota Business Corporation Act
(the " _MBCA_ "), whereby each of the issued and outstanding shares (the "
_Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") (other than Excluded Shares) will be converted into
the right to receive $30.00 per Share, payable net to the holder in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding
of Taxes required by applicable Law;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), as
required by the MBCA, among other things, unanimously (i) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, (iii) recommended
that the Company's shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "); and (iv) directed that the
approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company;

 



 

WHEREAS, (i) the Board of Directors of Parent has, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, approved this Agreement and (ii) Parent,
as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has adopted and approved this
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has (i) approved this Agreement
and declared its advisability and (ii) recommended the adoption and approval
of this Agreement by the sole shareholder of Merger Sub;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
_Section 9.03_.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 



   



 

ARTICLE I 

 _The Merger_

 



 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in
accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective Time the Company and Merger Sub
shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the MBCA and (iii) the
separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The
corporation surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Company_ ". The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, Merger Sub (and its actions hereunder) shall be disregarded and the
Merger shall be treated as a taxable purchase by Parent from shareholders of
the Company of the Shares converted in the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and in Section 302A.641 of the MBCA.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, (i) the Restated Articles of Incorporation of
the Company as in effect as of the Agreement Date (the " _Company Charter_ ")
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the form
attached as _Exhibit A_ and as so amended shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided
therein or in accordance with applicable Law, and (ii) the Third Restated
Bylaws of the Company as in effect as of the Agreement Date (the " _Company
Bylaws_ ") shall be amended in their entirety to read the same as the bylaws
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided
therein or in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company. The individuals specified
by Parent prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company.

 



 

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company
or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Company shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
shall take place at the offices of Fox Rothschild LLP, 222 South Ninth Street,
Suite 2000, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402 at 9:00 a.m., Central time, on a date
to be specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and
Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
with the Minnesota Secretary of State the articles of merger relating to the
Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Minnesota Secretary
of State, or at such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and
specify in the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being
the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE II 

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 



 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, any other
securities of the Company or any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub_ _Common Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) _Conversion of_ _Merger Sub_ _Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock and Subsidiary-Owned Stock_. Each
share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly by Parent, Merger Sub or
by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.02_ and
_2.03_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (x) any shares of Company Common Stock
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ and (y) except as provided in
_Section 2.03_ , any shares of Company Common Stock the holder of which (i)
has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of the Plan of
Merger, (ii) has demanded and perfected such holder's right to dissent from
the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, and (iii) as of the Effective Time
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenter's rights (the shares
referred to in clause (y), the " _Dissenting Shares_ " and together with the
shares referred to in clause (x), the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All such shares
of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Company Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders
of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence
shall not be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect
to its securities that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards_. All outstanding
Company Stock Options shall be treated in accordance with _Section 6.04(a)_.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its
sole cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
and delivery of the Merger Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall not include any amounts payable to holders of Company Stock Options
pursuant to _Section 6.04(a)_ ). Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates (other than Certificates representing Excluded Shares), for
payment in accordance with this _Article_ _II_ through the Paying Agent, cash
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration. All such cash deposited with the
Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ".

 



 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As reasonably promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) a form of letter
of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent,
shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify subject to the Company's
reasonable approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions
thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i)
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
represented by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled, or
(ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Paying Agent, in each case together with such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which
such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section
2.01_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is held in book-entry
form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or is not
applicable (as reasonably determined by Parent). Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.02(c)_ , each share of Company Common Stock,
and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to
_Section 2.01(c)_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock
held in book-entry form). Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form shall be
made only to the person in whose name such shares are registered.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
(or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to
Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent
nor the Surviving Company shall be required to deliver shares of Company
Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Company to any Person as a result of the exercise of or in settlement of any
Company Stock Options, and that all such Company Stock Options shall be
cancelled and the holders of such Company Stock Options shall only be entitled
to receive the consideration, if any, provided to them under _Section 6.04(a)_
and shall not have any other rights or remedies with respect thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
and any holder of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest
thereon. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) as of a date which
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect
of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment
shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to, and be the sole and exclusive property of,
Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund
shall diminish the rights of any of the Company's shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent
there are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund
diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms
hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained
at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any Person (including,
without limitation, payments treated as compensation made pursuant to _Section
6.04_ of this Agreement) pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax Law and pay such withholding amount over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 



 

 



   



 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
reasonably required by the Parent, the receipt by it of an indemnity bond in
form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Company, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.03 _Dissenter_ _'_ _s Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of
approval of the Merger and adoption of the plan of merger required by the MBCA
and set forth herein and who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
302A.471 of the MBCA, and who has properly exercised and perfected such
holder's demand for appraisal rights under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA (the "
_Dissenter 's Rights_"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01_ , but instead
the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to the payment of the
fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473
of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with such holder's
Dissenter's Rights. In such case, at the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except with respect to Dissenter's Rights and as
provided in this _Section 2.03_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have otherwise waived, or
effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to appraisal under the
Dissenter's Rights or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the Dissenter's Rights,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Dissenting Shares under the Dissenter's Rights shall cease, such shares shall
no longer be considered Dissenting Shares for purposes hereof, and such
holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, as provided in _Section 2.01_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any
notices or demands for appraisal by any holder of shares of Company Common

ARTICLE III 

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and_ _Merger Sub_

 



 

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this _Article III_ are true and
correct.

 



 

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all corporate power and
authority required to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions and to perform each of its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder, and
to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and
no other corporate proceedings (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
shareholder approval) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to consummate
the Transactions (except for the filing of the Articles of Merger as required
by the MBCA). The Merger Sub Board has unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Transactions; (ii) determining that the terms of this Agreement are in the
best interests of Merger Sub and Parent as its sole shareholder; (iii)
declaring this Agreement advisable; and (iv) recommending that Parent, as sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement and directing that this
Agreement be submitted to Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, for
adoption. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been
amended or withdrawn. Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has adopted
and approved this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general principles of equity.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 3.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement does not, and the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transactions will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to
make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any
loss of a material benefit, require a consent or waiver under, require the
payment of a penalty or change in control payment under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger
Sub under, any provision of (i) the governing or organizational documents of
Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any Contract to which either Parent or Merger Sub
is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound;
or (iii) assuming that all filings and other matters referred to in _Section
3.03(b)_ have been obtained, any Judgment or Law, in each case, applicable to
Parent or Merger Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) No Permit or Consents of or from, or registration, declaration, notice
or filing made to or with any Governmental Entity, is required to be obtained
or made by or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or its performance of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i) (A)
compliance with and filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and (B) such other Consents,
registrations, declarations, notices or filings as are required to be made or
obtained under any foreign antitrust, competition, merger control, trade
regulation or similar Laws, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Minnesota Secretary of State, and appropriate documents with the relevant

qualified to do business, (iii) complying with any applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, (iv) any filings with the SEC as may be required by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, (v) any
filings required under the rules and regulations of NASDAQ or NYSE and (vi)
such other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.04 _Information Supplied_. None of the information with respect
to Parent or Merger Sub supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub
expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, when filed with the SEC and at the date it is first mailed to the
Company's shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. No representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company or its Representatives for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein.

 



 

Section 3.05 _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Entity
involving Parent or Merger Sub that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection

agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or
commitments to enter into agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether
oral or written) (i) between Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, on

as set forth in the Company SEC Documents furnished or filed and publicly
available after January 1, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "

from the disclosure therein (but excluding any disclosures in the Filed
Company SEC Documents under the headings "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking

factual information contained therein) (it being understood that this clause

jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept) except in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries where the failure to be so organized, exist or be in good

other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of

Section 4.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all

Meeting (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "). The execution and delivery
of and performance by the Company under this Agreement, and the consummation
of the Transactions, have been duly authorized and approved by the Company
Board, and except for obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, no other
corporate action on the part of the Company (or its shareholders) is necessary

Section 302A.613, Subd. 1, thereof); (iii) recommending that the Company's
shareholders approve the Merger and adopt such plan of merger; and (iv)
directing that the approval of the Merger and the adoption of such plan of

Company Shareholder Approval, which is the only vote or approval of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to
approve the Transactions, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company (or its shareholders) are necessary to authorize or adopt this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (except for the filing of the
Articles of Merger as required by the MBCA). The Company has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms

or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or
any loss of a material benefit under, require a consent or waiver under,

Subsidiary only), (ii) and (iii) above, any matters which would not be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as whole.

made to or with any Governmental Entity or any stock market or stock exchange

Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or

documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC during such period
by the Company on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, being
collectively referred to as the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). The effects of
any uncorrected misstatements (taking into account SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin Nos. 99 and 108) accumulated by the Company's external auditors
pertaining to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company
SEC Documents are immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to the
consolidated financial statements of the Company, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Each Company SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied and were
prepared in all material respects with the requirements of SOX and the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto)
of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it
was filed as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows as of the dates thereof and for the
periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and
recurring year-end audit adjustments), in conformity with GAAP.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in the Company's
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 (or the notes thereto)
included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, (ii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) for liabilities and obligations that have been incurred in the ordinary
course of business since December 31, 2016 that individually or in the
aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (iv) for liabilities and obligations that have
been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, threatened, or otherwise, either mature or unmatured) which are
required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet, including the
footnotes thereto, under GAAP. The Company has no outstanding Indebtedness
other than under the Existing Credit Agreement and capital lease obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the
principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive
officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the
Company, as applicable) has made all applicable certifications required by
Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX
with respect to the Company SEC Documents.

 



 

(e) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed
only in accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's properties or assets. The Company's management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of SOX for the year ended December 31, 2016, and, except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents, such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant roles in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting. As of the date hereof, the Company has not identified any
material weaknesses in internal controls and the Company is not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations

Section 5.04 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board

(a) Subject to _Section 5._ _0_ _4(b)_ , _Section 5._ _0_ _4(c)_ ,
_Section 5._ _0_ _4(d)_ and Section _5._ _0_ _4(e)_ , during the period from
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ _I_ , the
Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit its Subsidiaries to, and
shall not permit its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i)
initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate or solicit (including in
each case by way of furnishing material non-public information of the Company

participate in or solicit any discussions or negotiations with any Person
(whether such discussions or negotiations are initiated by the Company, any of

shareholder" under, Section 302A.673 of the MBCA), or any restrictive
provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company Charter or
Company Bylaws inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Alternative
Proposal (and, to the extent permitted thereunder, the Company shall promptly
take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore
granted to any Person other than Parent or any of its Affiliates under any
such provisions), (vi) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger

_Section 5.04_ _(c)_ ) (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (vii) adopt
or approve any Alternative Proposal, or propose the approval or adoption of
any Alternative Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such action. The
Company shall immediately cease, and cause its Subsidiaries and direct its and
their Representatives to terminate, any cooperation with or assistance or
participation in any inquiries or proposals of any Persons made prior to the
date hereof, and any discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
theretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives, in each case, with respect to any Alternative Proposal, and
request and instruct to be returned or destroyed all non-public information
provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such
Person relating to an Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement will prohibit or restrict the Company from, at any
time, releasing any Person from any 'standstill' provision in favor of the
Company to which a Person may be subject solely to the extent to allow the
applicable Person to make a confidential Alternative Proposal to the Company
Board.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) the receipt by the Company or any of its

fide inquiries, proposals or offers, requests for information or requests for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person making
such Alternative Proposal, and (ii) any material modifications to the
financial or other material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal,
in each case as promptly as practical (and in any event within 48 hours) of
receipt thereof by the Company or any of its Representatives. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing such information to Parent and, to the extent the
Company is permitted by this _Section 5._ _04_ to engage in discussions or
negotiations relating to any Alternative Proposal, shall otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

 



 

(c) If at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (i) the Company has received a
written Alternative Proposal from a third party that the Company Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Alternative Proposal did not
result from a breach of this _Section 5.04_ and (iii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that not
taking such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law, then the Company may (1) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative
Proposal and (2) engage and participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Alternative Proposal regarding such Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will not
permit its Subsidiaries to, and will not permit its Representatives to,
disclose any material non-public information to such Person without first
entering or having entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with
such Person and (y) will concurrently provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made
available to such other Person which was not previously provided or made
available to Parent.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 5.04(d)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withhold, withdraw or
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval, determination of
advisability, or recommendation by such Company Board or committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Merger, and the other Transactions contemplated hereby,
(B) make any other public statement in connection with the Company
Shareholders Meeting by or on behalf of such Company Board or committee
thereof that would reasonably be expected to have the same effect or (C)
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, to the shareholders of the
Company an Alternative Proposal (any action described in this clause being
referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger,
acquisition or similar agreement that is intended or could reasonably be
expected to result in, any Alternative Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided the
Company shall not have breached in any material respect its obligations under
this _Section 5._ _04_ , (i) in response to an Intervening Event or (ii) if
the Company receives an Alternative Proposal which the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal (after taking into account
all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by
Parent in accordance with subparagraph (II) below of this _Section 5.04(d)_ ),
then, in each case, the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that not taking such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Company's shareholders under applicable
Law, (1) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) only in the case of
the immediately preceding clause (ii) of this _Section 5.04(d)_ , approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal and/or terminate this Agreement to enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal pursuant to
_Section 8.01(c_ _)(_ _i_ _i)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) unless
at or concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination the Company
pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee in full and
otherwise complies with the provisions of _Section 8.03_ ; and provided,
further, that the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), approve or recommend any Superior
Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (2), (A)
if, in the case of clause (2), such Superior Proposal resulted from a breach
by the Company of this _Section 5.04_ and (B) unless, in the case of clauses
(1) and (2):

 



 

(I) the Company Board shall have first provided at least three (3)
Business Days' prior written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") to Parent that it is prepared to take the applicable action in
response to a Intervening Event or a Superior Proposal, as applicable, which
notice shall describe such Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, as
applicable, in reasonable detail, and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, be
accompanied by the most current version of all relevant material written
agreements or proposals relating to the transaction that constitutes such
Superior Proposal (it being agreed that the Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change and any amendment or update to such Notice of Adverse Recommendation
Change and the determination to so deliver such Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change, or update or amend public disclosures with respect
thereto, shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of
this Agreement); and

 



 

 



   



 

(II) Parent does not make, within such three (3) Business Day period, a
binding, written, irrevocable offer to modify the terms of this Agreement so
that such terms, as so modified, would, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors), cause the Alternative Proposal previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that would
obviate the need to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in the event of a
Intervening Event, as applicable, in each case, taking into consideration any
risk of non-consummation and all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of each such proposal. The Company agrees that, during the three (3)
Business Day period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or
taking another action permitted by clause (2) above, if requested by Parent,
the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereunder such that the Alternative Proposal in
question would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or that would obviate
the need to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in the event of a
Intervening Event. Each successive modification to the price or any other
material term of any Alternative Proposal shall constitute a new Alternative
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.04(d)_ and shall require a new Notice
of Adverse Recommendation Change under _Section 5.04(d)(I)_ above, if
applicable.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company shareholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing a "stop, look
and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal
or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company (other than
an Adverse Recommendation Change, which may be made only in accordance with
_Section 5.04(d)_ ) if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with applicable Law, (iii) informing any Person of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.04_ or (iv) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to the shareholders of the Company). No disclosures under this _Section
5.04(e)_ shall be, in themselves, a breach of this _Section 5.04_ or a basis
for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII if such
disclosure is required under applicable Law or required under the rules and
regulations of any applicable stock exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act or an express rejection of any applicable Alternative Proposal
together with an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation,
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation Change,
it shall promptly make a public announcement of such change and such
announcement and shall set forth the material reasons for such change.
Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties
hereunder shall continue in full force and effect.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them below:

 



 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement containing terms no materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to
the Company than the terms set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such confidentiality agreement (i) shall include
a "standstill" restriction that is similar in scope to the "standstill"
restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement, but such restrictions need not
prohibit the making of any confidential Alternative Proposal to the Company or
the Company Board (or any committee thereof), and (ii) shall not provide for
an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and shall not restrict the
Company from complying with any term or condition of this Agreement, including
the requirement in _Section 5.04_ to provide information to Parent.

 



 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean, with respect to the Company, any
material development or change in circumstances that is not related to an
Alternative Proposal, to the extent such material development or change in
circumstances is disproportionately more favorable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants operating in
the same industries in similar geographic markets in which the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries operate, occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement
but prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and was neither known
to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its or their Representatives as of the date of this Agreement (or if
known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof); _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) changes in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds internal or
published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any
period shall not constitute a Intervening Event (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such change or fact may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Intervening
Event) and (ii) the results of the introduction of new or modified products or
the results of sales or marketing initiatives (including any increase in sales
as a result thereof whether to new or existing customers) are reasonably
foreseeable and shall not be considered a material development or change in
circumstances.

 



 

(iii) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer
(whether or not in writing) from any person or group (other than Parent or
Purchaser) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, (1) any direct or indirect acquisition of (A) 20% or more of the
assets (whether based on the fair market value, revenue generation or net
income) of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
including in any such case through the acquisition of one or more Subsidiaries
owning such assets, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock
(or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, such Company Common
Stock); (2) any tender offer or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to the
Exchange Act, that if consummated would result, directly or indirectly, in any
person or group (or the shareholders of any person or group) beneficially
owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock; or (3) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company
that would result in any person or group (or the shareholders of any person or
group) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or 20% or more of the voting power of the
surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity (or any securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting
power). Whenever the term "group" is used in this Agreement, it shall have the
definition set forth in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Alternative
Proposal made by any person or group (other than Parent or Purchaser) after
the Agreement Date, which Alternative Proposal did not result in any material
respect from a breach (or deemed breach) of this _Section 5.04_ , that (1)
would result in such person or group (or in the case of a direct merger
between such person and the Company, the shareholders of such person)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding Shares or
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (2) is on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Alternative Proposal) are more favorable to the Company's
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions (taking into
account any proposed amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to
_Section 5.04(_ _d_ _)_ _(II)_ ), (3) the Company Board determines (after
receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is
reasonably likely of being consummated in accordance with its terms on a
timely basis, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects (including certainty of closing and certainty of financing) of such
proposal, and (4) for which financing, to the extent required, is then fully
committed or, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after receiving
the advice of its financial advisors, is reasonably likely to be obtained.

 



 

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that in the event any
Company Representative or any Company Subsidiary takes any action, on behalf
of the Company, which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material
breach of this _Section 5.04_ , and the Company does not take reasonable
action to seek to cure such breach within two (2) Business Days of the earlier
of (i) the date on which the Company receives written notice from Parent or
Purchaser of such breach and (ii) the date on which the Company obtains
Knowledge of such breach, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of
this _Section 5.04_.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.05 _Meeting of Shareholders to Approve the Merger_ _;
Preparation of the Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a Proxy Statement for the Company
Shareholders Meeting relating to the Merger and this Agreement, which shall
include, among other things, the Opinion; _provided_ that Parent, Purchaser
and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the preliminary Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and their counsel
with the intention that the Proxy Statement be in a form ready to print and
mail to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following
the Proxy Statement Clearance Date. The Company shall (i) notify Parent of the
receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of
any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information, (ii) provide to Parent promptly copies of all written
correspondence or telephonic notice of oral communications between the Company
or any Company Representative and the SEC or its staff with respect thereto
and (iii) give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on all responses to requests for additional information, amendments to
the Proxy and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to,
the SEC. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other Parties, to
respond promptly to all such comments of, and requests by, the SEC or its
staff, and to cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by
the SEC and mailed to the Company's shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by such Party for use in the Proxy Statement, if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
promptly cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC
and, if any such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act and/or the MBCA.

 



 

(b) The Company, acting through (or upon authorization by) the Company
Board (or a committee thereof), shall, in accordance with and subject to the
requirements of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and applicable Law:

 



 

(i) as promptly as practicable following the Proxy Statement Clearance
Date, (A) duly set a record date for, call and give notice of a special
meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (with the record
date and meeting date set in consultation with Purchaser) and the approval of
the Merger and the other Transactions and such other matters as may be legally
required, and (B) convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting;

 



 

(ii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be printed and mailed to the
shareholders of the Company;

 



 

(iii) subject to the right of the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.04_ , continue to make the
Company Board Recommendation and include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and solicit proxies in connection therewith; and

 



 

(iv) comply in all material respects with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting.

 



 

 



   



 

The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation
results as reasonably requested by Parent. If on a date for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is scheduled the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, (i) the
Company shall, after consultation with Parent, have the right to, and (ii) the
Company shall, at any time, upon the written direction of Parent, in each
case, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Shareholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Alternative Proposal and the obligation of the Company to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting and mail the Proxy
Statement (and any amendment or supplement that may be required by Law) to the
Company's shareholders shall not be affected by an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 



 

ARTICLE VI 

Additional Agreements

 



 

Section 6.01 _Cooperation_. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate in connection with (a) the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
any other filings required to be made by the Company with the SEC and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning Parent and its Affiliates to the
Company as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, (b) determining whether any
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any actions are required to be taken under, or consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to, any Material
Contracts, in connection with any of the Transactions and (c) timely taking
any such actions, seeking any such consents, approvals or waivers or making
any such filings or furnishing information required in connection therewith or
with the Proxy Statement or any other filings required to be made by the
Company with the SEC.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access,
upon reasonable advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time,
to all their respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel
and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a) to the
extent not publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws or commission actions and (b)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (in each case, in a manner so as to not
interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary); _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that the Company
shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the
extent it determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
disclosure or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of
any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third-party (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third-party to such access or disclosure); (ii)
result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the
Company shall use its reasonable efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege); or (iii) violate any Law ( _provided_
that the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to provide such access or
make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law). Following
expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the
Company shall also arrange visits by Representatives of Parent to such
customers as shall be reasonably requested by Parent after consultation with,
and subject to the consent of (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide

reasonably promptly as practicable taking all steps as may be reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain all such Governmental Approvals as
soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event on or prior to the End Date);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any of the parties hereto or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to (and in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, without
Parent's prior written consent) pay any consideration or make any agreement or
commitments in any case prior to the Effective Time in connection with
obtaining any such approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits,

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the actions
referenced in _Section 6._ _0_ _3(a)_ to obtain all Governmental Approvals for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Laws, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any communication, filing or submission and in connection with any

private party; (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,

person, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences; and (iv) permit the other party
and/or its counsel to review in advance any submission, filing or
communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be given by it
to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity; _provided_ that

businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be provided to the other under this _Section 6._ _0_
_3(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent, after, to the extent
practicable, prior consultation with the Company, shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
necessary antitrust, competition or investment review clearances, including in
connection with the determination of any actions to be taken under _Section
6.03(e)_ , and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust,
competition or investment review clearances.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required
to agree to (nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries agree unless
Parent so directs them (and they shall, if Parent so directs, agree, so long
as such agreements are conditioned upon the Closing)), to (i) sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of its respective business,
assets or properties, or conduct its business in a specified manner, (ii) pay
any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees and expenses and fees of
counsel or any nominal payments), or grant any counterparty to any Contract
any meaningful accommodation, (iii) limit in any manner whatsoever the ability
of such entities to conduct, own, operate or control any of their respective
businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties or assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (iv) waive any of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ , or (v) initiate, defend, participate in, continue, or
appeal any Action in order to obtain the successful termination of any review
of any review of any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or the other
Transactions, or any related matter brought by or on behalf of any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall limit a party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)_ so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
_Section 6.03_.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur has
resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in the failure to
satisfy or be able to satisfy any of the conditions specified in _Article VII_
, and such written notice shall specify the condition which has failed or will
fail to be satisfied; (ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent such consent is
material to the Company; and (iii) any material written notice from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.03(d)_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to Parent or the Company.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets,
business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint
venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Regulatory Laws with respect to the
Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Company Equity and Equity-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding Company Stock Option that previously has not expired or
been exercised shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled in exchange for the
right of the holder thereof to receive from the Company, in full and final
settlement of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash payable at the time
of cancellation of such Company Stock Option equal to the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of (y) the Merger Consideration over (z) the per share
exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option regardless
of whether or not vested as of the Effective Time (less any required
withholding under applicable Tax Law). If the exercise price per share under
any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled at the Effective
Time without any payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof;
and in no event shall any Company Stock Options be assumed by Parent or the
Surviving Company. The Company shall cause payments pursuant to this _Section
6.04(a)_ to be made to the holder of any Company Stock Option, if a current or
former employee of the Company, through the payroll system of the Surviving
Company or, if not a current or former employee of the Company, through the
Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former employees of the Company,
in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the
Surviving Company following the Closing Date).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall (or shall cause) no
further offering periods to commence under the ESPP from and after the date of
this Agreement. The Company (or appropriate committee) shall take (or cause to
be taken), as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, all
reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary resolutions to (i)
terminate the ESPP effective immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that if the Effective Time has not occurred by the end of the
Current Offering Period, then the Company will suspend the ESPP following the
end of the Current Offering Period until the Effective Time, (ii) ensure that
no offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of
this Agreement, (iii) prohibit participants in the ESPP from altering their
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other
than to discontinue their participation in the ESPP in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the ESPP) or allowing any new participants in the ESPP
after the date of this Agreement, and (iv) provide that the amount of the
accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase Shares
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP be refunded to such
participant before or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time
(without interest). If the Effective Time occurs on or before the end of the
Current Offering Period, reasonably promptly following the Effective Time, the
Company shall pay each participant in the Current Offering Period an amount
(not less than zero) in cash equal to (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied
by (ii) the result obtained by dividing (A) the amount of the payroll
deductions credited to such participant's account pursuant to the ESPP prior
to the Effective Time by, (B) the purchase price (as defined in the ESPP).

 



 

(c) _401(k) Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, if
requested to do so by Parent in writing not less than ten (10) Business Days
before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, terminate any and all
Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same
"Controlled Group of Corporations" (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code)
as Parent. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
401(k) plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to accept any distribution from the
Company 401(k) plan(s) as a rollover contribution.

 



 

(d) _Company Actions_. If requested by Merger Sub, at the Effective Time,
all Company Stock Plans will be terminated in accordance with their respective
terms and no further equity awards or other rights with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock or other equity interest (including stock appreciation
rights, restricted share units, performance shares, phantom units, deferred
share units and dividend equivalents) in the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or the Surviving Company will be granted thereunder. The Company shall, prior
to the Effective Time, take the actions set forth on _Schedule I_.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
may reasonably be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this
_Section 6.04_. The Company shall provide Parent (and its counsel) (i) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any documents (whether
amendments, resolutions, communications or otherwise) necessary or advisable
to effectuate this _Section 6.04_ , (ii) with rights of approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of any such documents
and (iii) satisfactory evidence that all necessary actions have been taken.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided
in their respective articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar agreements
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms (it being agreed that after the Closing such
rights shall be mandatory rather than permissive, if applicable), and Parent
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to perform its
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or
who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director or officer of
another Person (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out
of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director
or officer of another Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each
Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of reasonable
expenses of counsel reasonably selected by the Indemnified Parties, incurred
in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the
Surviving Company within 10 Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Company
from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if any only to
the extent required by the MBCA or the Surviving Company's articles of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person
is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.05_.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having
at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no
event shall the Surviving Company be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 6.05(c)_ it shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-
year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of
each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company may, and at Parent's request shall, purchase a "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability
insurance policy for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company,
such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage
and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided
that in no event shall the cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one
policy year exceed the Maximum Amount. The Surviving Company shall maintain
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ (i) shall survive consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company under this
_Section 6.05_.

 



 

Section 6.06 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder or similar litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
officers relating to the Transactions. The Company agrees that it shall not
settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date
of this Agreement against the Company or any of its directors or executive
officers by any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the
Transactions or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 6.07 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
Transactions by each individual who will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Alternative
Proposal, Superior Proposal or related matters strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, or any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement or the Transactions, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such
party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court
process, the requirements of NASDAQ or the NYSE, or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system, in which case the issuing Party shall use its
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing any press
release or making any such public statements, except with respect to the
matters described in, and subject to the requirements of, _Section 5.04_ ,
_Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.03_ , or in connection with any dispute between
the Parties regarding this Agreement. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties. Nothing in this _Section 6.08_ shall limit the ability of any
party hereto to make internal announcements to their respective employees that
are consistent in all material respects with the prior public disclosures
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Company shall provide Parent (and its counsel) with
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any announcements to employees
with rights of approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.08_ shall terminate
upon an Adverse Action.

Closing Date (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier or specific date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier or
specific date), except where the failure to be true and correct (without
giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained therein) would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 4.01_ ,
_Section 4.02_ , _Section 4.03_ (except for the representations and warranties
in _Section 4.03(a)_ , which shall be true and correct in all respects except

Date signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to
such effect.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 7.03 _Conditions to Obligations of the Company_. The obligation
of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction (or
waiver by the Company, if permissible under applicable Law) on or prior to the
Closing Date of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties
of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the same
effect as though made on and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent
that such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier or
specific date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such earlier or specific date) except where such failures to
be so true and correct would not have a material adverse effect on Parent's
and Merger Sub's ability to consummate the Transactions; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 3.02_ shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as

Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate dated the
Closing Date signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of Parent to

Section 7.04 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.01_ , _Section 7.02_ or _Section 7.03_ , as the case may be, to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's failure to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions or due to the failure of such party to perform in all material
respects any of its other obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII 

 _Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

 



 

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned (notwithstanding the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval) (the date of any such
termination, the " _Termination Date_ "):

 



 

(a) at any time prior to the Effective Time by mutual written consent of
the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) at any time prior to the Effective Time by either the Company or
Parent:

 



 

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the six-
month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (as such date is extended
pursuant to the following proviso, as applicable, the " _End Date_ ");
provided, however, that if the Closing has not occurred by such date and on
such date any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01(b)_ , _Section
7.01(c)_ , or _Section 7.0_ _1_ _(d)_ have not been satisfied or waived and
each of the other conditions to consummation of the Merger set forth in
_Article V_ _I_ _I_ has been satisfied, waived or remains capable of
satisfaction by such date, then the End Date shall automatically be extended
to the date which is the nine-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement;
and provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ _8.01_ _(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose
material breach of any provision of this Agreement directly or indirectly
causes the failure of the Effective Time to occur by the End Date;

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Legal Restraint
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal prior to the
Effective Time, the Merger, and such decision, injunction, decree, ruling, Law
or Order shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)(_
_ii)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of this Agreement has
been the primary cause or primarily resulted in the issuance of such Legal
Restraint; or

 



 

(iii) if the Company Shareholders Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall have been held and shall have concluded and the
Company Shareholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have
been obtained; _p_ _rovided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ _8.01_ _(b)(iii)_ shall not be available
to a party if the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval was
primarily due to the material breach by such party of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) by the Company:

 



 

(i) at any time prior to the Effective Time, if Parent or Merger Sub shall
have breached any of its representations or warranties, or failed to perform
any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform (i) shall have had a Parent Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the End Date or, if curable by such
date, is not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) calendar days after
written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and (B) the End Date;
provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)(i)_ if the Company is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants which would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section
7.02(b)_ ; or

 



 

(ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.04_ ; _provided_ that (A) the Company
shall have complied with _Section_ _5.04(d)_ and (B) the Company pays the
Termination Fee prior to, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such
termination (it being understood that the Company may, in accordance with
_Section 5.04(d)_ , enter into such definitive written agreement
simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement).

 



 

 



   



 

(d) by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(i) if (A) the Company Board shall have effected an Adverse Action; or (B)
the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into an Acquisition Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_
, and which breach or failure to perform is incapable of being cured prior to
the End Date or, if curable by such date, is not cured within the earlier of
(A) thirty (30) calendar days after written notice thereof is given by Parent
to the Company and (B) the End Date; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ if
either Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants which would give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section 8.01_ ,
written notice thereof shall be given to the other parties, specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Purchaser, other
than the next to last sentence of _Section 6.02_ , this _Section 8.02_ ,
_Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which provisions shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve
or release any party from any liability or damages for any fraud or willful
breach of this Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled
to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity. For purposes of
this Agreement, "willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an
act or omission undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the
taking of, or failure to take, such act would cause or constitute a material
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as specifically provided for herein, all Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction is
consummated, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent or its designee a fee in immediately
available funds of $5,600,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(c)(ii)_ , which Termination Fee shall be paid prior to or concurrently
with, and as a condition of, the termination of this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ , which Termination Fee shall be paid within two (2) Business Days
of such termination; or

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) (A) this Agreement (1) is terminated by either party pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ or (2) is or, at the time of a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , could have been
(and in such case Parent provides written notice of such right to terminate to
the Company within 30 days of the termination of this Agreement), terminated
by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , (B) an Alternative Proposal
(whether or not modified after it was first made) is publicly disclosed,
announced or otherwise made public, in each case other than by Parent, (x) in
the case of _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ , prior to the date of termination of this
Agreement, (y) in the case of _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ , prior to the date of
the Company Shareholders Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments
thereof) or (z) in the case of _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ , prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement, and (C) within one (1) year following such
termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement providing for, or otherwise consummates, an Alternative Proposal (in
each case regardless of whether such Alternative Proposal is the same
Alternative Proposal described in clause (B) above or was made or consummated
before or after termination of this Agreement), which Termination Fee shall be
paid upon the earlier of the public announcement of the Company's entry into
any such agreement or the consummation of any such transaction; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.03(b)(iii_ _)_ , the
references to 20% in the definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall be deemed
to be references to 50.1%.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8._ _03_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that shall
compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such payment is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Company would enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, (i) if the Company fails to reasonably promptly
pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ , and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results
in a Judgment in its favor for such payment, the Company shall pay to Parent
its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest on the
amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate
published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest begins
accruing.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the parties
agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall, except in the case of
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement and except for specific performance
as provided in _Section 9.10_ , be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable,
and, in such circumstances, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company
(and the Company's Affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, shareholders and Representatives) shall have no further
liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. In no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented by the parties at any time before or
after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that following the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment
or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval
of this Agreement or the Transactions by the shareholders of the Company
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) waive compliance with any
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No
extension or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the Company's
shareholders unless such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_.
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_ , an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.04_ or an extension or waiver pursuant
to _Section 8.05_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the shareholders of either
Parent or the Company.

the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages,

prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including the right of a party to cause the other parties to consummate the
Transactions. It is agreed that the parties are entitled to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in clause (a) below, without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court located within the
State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action (whether, in contract, tort,
equity or otherwise) relating to this Agreement or the Transactions; (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; and (c) agrees that
it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in
any court other than the aforesaid courts.
