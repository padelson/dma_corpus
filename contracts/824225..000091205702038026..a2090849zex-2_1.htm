 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of October 7, 2002, among OAK TECHNOLOGY, INC. (" _Parent_ "), a Delaware corporation, OPTIC ACQUISITION CORP. (" _Merger Sub_ "), a Delaware corporation, and TERALOGIC, INC. (the " _Company_ "), a Delaware corporation. 

  

WITNESSETH:

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent; 

  

 WHEREAS, The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement (as defined below), the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and (iii) resolved to recommend to the stockholders of the Company that they adopt and approve this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; 

  

 WHEREAS, to induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into an agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") with Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to which such stockholders will agree to vote to approve this Agreement and to take certain actions in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the Company are entering into a loan agreement and related documents (collectively, the " _Loan Agreement_ ") pursuant to which Parent shall make certain loans to the Company; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  

 Section 1.1 _ The Merger._ 

   

 (a) _ Surviving Corporation._ At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall 

   cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving
Corporation_."

  

 (b) _ Closing._ Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article VII and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the consummation of the Merger will take place as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two business days) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, at the offices of Pillsbury Winthrop LLP, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 (c) _ Escrow._ At the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Parent shall withhold (i) ten percent (10%) of the aggregate Cash Consideration (as defined in Section 1.6(c)) _plus_ (ii) an additional amount equal to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (collectively, the " _Escrow Amount_ ") payable to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6 of this Agreement (the " _Escrow Account_ "), on a pro rata basis among all Stockholders in proportion to the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration each Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive, and shall instead deliver the Escrow Amount to an escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The Escrow Amount shall be held pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 6.1(e) (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Amount will be available to compensate Parent for certain of the damages as provided in Article VIII. On the date that is six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Escrow Agent will be directed to release an Escrow Amount equal to the lesser of: (i) fifty percent (50%) of the total Escrow Amount; and (ii) the total Escrow Amount minus the Escrow Amount which has been used (or reserved for such use) to compensate Parent for damages under Article VIII. To the extent that there is an Escrow Amount remaining in the Escrow Account which has not been reserved for claims under the Escrow Agreement on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, such Escrow Amount will be released. 

  

 (d) _ Stockholder Representative._ All of the stockholders of the Company, by virtue of their approval of the Agreement, will be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed, effective as of the Effective Time, Jon S. Castor (together with his permitted successors, the " _Stockholder Representative_ "), as their true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact to enter into any agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any transactions contemplated by the Escrow Agreement, to exercise all or any of the powers, authority and discretion conferred on him, her or it under any such agreement, to waive or amend any terms and conditions of any such agreement, to give and receive notices on their behalf and to be their exclusive representative with respect to any matter, suit, claim, action or proceeding arising with respect to any transaction contemplated by any such agreement, including, without limitation, the defense, settlement or compromise of any claim, action or proceeding for which Parent or the Merger Sub may be entitled to indemnification and the Stockholder Representative agrees to act as, and to undertake the duties and responsibilities of, such agent and attorney-in-fact. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by him, her or it in connection with his, her or its obligations under this Agreement (i) with the consent of the Preferred Stockholders (as 

   defined below) owning at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding
Preferred Stock (as defined below) of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as defined below), voting together as a single class with
each share of such Preferred Stock voting on an as-if converted basis
(excluding non-voting Preferred Stock) or (ii) in the absence of his own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If the Stockholder Representative
shall be unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, his successor shall be
named by those Preferred Stockholders owning at least a majority in voting
power of the outstanding Preferred Stock of the Company at immediately prior
to Effective Time, voting together as a single class with each share of such
Preferred Stock voting on an as-if converted basis in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.5 of the Escrow Agreement.

  

 Section 1.2 _ Effective Time._ As promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a duly executed and delivered Certificate of Merger in substantially the form of Exhibit 1.2 (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such time thereafter as is provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

  

 Section 1.3 _ Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.4 _ Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Surviving Corporation._ 

  

 (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to read as did the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "OPTICAL DIGITAL VIDEO GROUP, INC." 

  

 (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated to read as set forth in the By-laws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "OPTICAL DIGITAL VIDEO GROUP, INC." 

  

 Section 1.5 _ Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation._ The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

   Section 1.6 _ Conversion of Shares._ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Stockholder of the Company, the Cash Consideration (as defined in Section 1.6(c)), less the Escrow Amount, shall be paid as follows: 

  

  

 (i) Each share of the Company\'s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall no longer represent any interest in the Company nor any interest in the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger Sub (the holders of Common Stock are sometimes herein collectively referred to as the " _Common Stockholders_ "). After payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration (as defined herein) to the Preferred Stockholders in accordance with this Section 1.6 and in accordance with the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation, no portion of the Cash Consideration will remain available for distribution to the Common Stockholders, and accordingly, each share of Common Stock shall receive $0.00. 

  

 (ii) Each share of the Company\'s Series A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series A Preferred Stock_"), Series B Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series B Preferred Stock_"), Series C Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series C Preferred Stock"_), Series D Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series D Preferred Stock_"), Series E-1 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series E-1 Preferred Stock_"), Series E-2 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series E-2 Preferred Stock_"), Series E-3 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series E-3 Preferred Stock_"), Series E-4 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series E-4 Preferred Stock_"), Series E-5 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series E-5 Preferred Stock_") and Series E-6 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (" _Series E-6 Preferred Stock_"; the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E-1 Preferred Stock, Series E-2 Preferred Stock, Series E-3 Preferred Stock, Series E-4 Preferred Stock, Series E-5 Preferred Stock and Series E-6 Preferred Stock are sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Preferred Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger (each such share of Common Stock and Preferred Stock is referred to herein individually as a " _Share_ " and collectively as the " _Shares_ "), other than Shares held in treasury or which constitute Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.6(d) below), shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the corresponding purchase price of such Preferred Stock, as set forth in Exhibit 1.6(a)(ii) (the holders of Preferred Stock are sometimes herein collectively referred to as the " _Preferred Stockholders_ " and collectively with the Common Stockholders, the " _Stockholders_ "); provided, that if the Cash Consideration distributed to the Preferred Stockholders is insufficient to permit the receipt of such Preferred Stockholders\' purchase price, the Preferred Stockholders will be entitled to receive their pro rata share of the Cash Consideration available in proportion to the respective amounts which would be received by them if their respective amounts were paid in full. 

  

  (b) At the Effective Time, each Share held in treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be canceled and retired and all rights in respect thereof shall cease to exist. 

   

 (c) The total cash consideration is Thirty-Eight Million Two Hundred Sixty-Nine Thousand Six Hundred Ninety-One Dollars ($38,269,691) (the " _Cash Consideration_ "). 

  

 (d) Any Shares with respect to which dissenters\' rights have been established in accordance with the DGCL or the California Corporations Code, as applicable (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into a right to receive Cash Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.6 but, at the Effective Time, shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the California Corporations Code or DGCL, as applicable; provided, however, that if the status of any such Shares as Dissenting Shares shall not be perfected, or if any such Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect, or loss of, such status, such Shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such Shares) the amount of Cash Consideration as set forth in this Section 1.6, without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written notice of intent to demand, election to demand or demand received by it for appraisal rights, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required under applicable law, it will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such notice of intent to demand, election to demand or demand for appraisal. 

  

 Section 1.7 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

 (a) Within four (4) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in an account of a bank or trust company designated by Parent, which may in the Parent\'s sole discretion be Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares (other than Dissenting Shares), for exchange or payment in accordance with this Section 1.7, through the Exchange Agent, cash in an amount sufficient for payment of the Cash Consideration. 

  

 (b) Within two (2) business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (as of the record date designated by Board of Directors of the Company) which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced the outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6 of this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, from and after the Effective Time, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a 

   check in the amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.6 of this Agreement, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. Within one business day after Parent receives
oral confirmation from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware that
the Certificate of Merger has been accepted for filing, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to release and pay the amounts due to all holders of
Certificates who have surrendered their certificates along with their properly
executed letters of transmittal prior to the Effective Time. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a cash payment pursuant to Section 1.6 of this
Agreement. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to
the making of any cash payment pursuant to this Agreement, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit of loss and indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.

  

 (c) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for any cash amounts delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cash Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Stockholder, such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub or the Company determines necessary to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign "Tax" (as defined in Section 2.15(a) below) law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 Section 1.8 _ Stock Transfer Books._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. 

  

 Section 1.9 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Shares._ The Cash Consideration delivered upon the surrender for exchange of the Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

  

 Section 1.10 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and 

   Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in
the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take,
all such lawful and necessary action.

   

 Section 1.11 _ Stock Options and other Securities._ All options to purchase capital stock of the Company (the "Company Options"), warrants and other rights to purchase capital stock of the Company or any other security of the Company that shall not have been exercised or converted before the Closing Date shall be canceled and extinguished, and shall be of no further force or effect as of the Closing Date.

 (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and the Parent; 

  

 (b) by either Parent or the Company if (i) the Effective Time has not occurred by November 30, 2002 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date and such action or failure constitutes a breach of this Agreement, (ii) there shall be a final nonappealable order, decree or ruling of a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction in effect preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental Entity which makes consummation of the Merger illegal;

 (d) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would (i) prohibit Parent\'s or the Company\'s ownership or operation of any portion of the business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold separate, as a result of the Merger, any material portion of the business or assets of the Company or Parent; 

  

 (e) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company in a manner causing the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) hereof, as the case may be, not to be satisfied and such breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days of receipt by Company of written notice of such breach; 

  

 (f) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this 

    Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or

not have been cured within thirty (30) days of receipt by Parent of written
notice of such breach;

  

 (g) by Parent, in the event of a material breach of the Voting Agreement by any other party to such agreement and such breach results in the inability of Company\'s Stockholders to otherwise approve the Merger;

 Section 7.2 _ Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved of any obligation or liability arising from any prior breach by such party of any provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.3 _ Expenses._ Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, related agreements and documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the fees and expenses of its advisers, accountants and legal counsel) shall be paid by the party incurring such expense; provided, however, in the event that the Merger is consummated, the Parent shall be responsible for the legal, investment banking, financial advisory, accounting and other fees and expenses of the Company (including those items and amounts listed on Schedule 7.3) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in an amount not to exceed $950,000 (the "Expense Cap").

ARTICLE VIII

  

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

  

 Section 8.1 _ Survival._ The covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall 

    survive and shall remain operative and in full force and effect until 5:00
p.m., California time, on the date which is the six month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Expiration Date"), except as to matters as to which an
indemnified party has made a claim for indemnity or given a Notice of Claim
(as defined below) on or prior to the Expiration Date, which matters shall
survive the expiration of such period until such claim is finally resolved
and any obligations with respect thereto are fully satisfied; provided that
with respect to claims for indemnification under Sections 8.2(d), 8.2(e) and
8.8(b) the Expiration Date shall mean 5:00 p.m., California time, on the date
which is the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date. Any investigation
or other examination that may have been made or may be made at any time by or
on behalf of the party to whom representations and warranties are made shall
not limit, diminish or in any way affect the representations and warranties in
this Agreement, and the parties may rely on the representations and
warranties in this Agreement irrespective of any information obtained by them
during any investigation, examination or otherwise.

   

 Section 8.2 _ Indemnification by Company Stockholders._ As an integral term of the Merger, the Stockholders, by virtue of their approval of the Merger, shall severally, and not jointly, indemnify (subject to Section 8.5 hereof), defend and hold harmless Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, and each of their respective affiliates and subsidiaries, from and against any claims, damages, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, adjustments, Taxes (including Taxes on indemnity payments), losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys\' fees in connection with any of the foregoing) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates and subsidiaries caused by, resulting from or arising out of: 

  

 (a) (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith, or (ii) any and all claims, allegations, actions, suits, litigations, arbitrations or proceedings by third parties during the Escrow Period that if ultimately determined to be true would constitute an indemnifiable claim under the immediately preceding clause (i); 

   

 (b) (i) any failure by the Company to perform any of its obligations or covenants set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith, or (ii) any and all claims, allegations, actions, suits, litigations, arbitrations or proceedings by third parties during the Escrow Period that if ultimately determined to be true would constitute an indemnifiable claim under the immediately preceding clause (i); 

  

 (c) any Tax liability, or asserted liability, of the Company or its subsidiaries attributable to periods (or any portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date; 

   

 (d) (i) any claims, actions, suits, litigations, arbitrations or proceedings by the stockholders of the Company relating to the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, against the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their directors or officers before any federal, foreign, state or provincial court, arbitrator or Governmental Entity; or (ii) the exercise by any of the Company\'s stockholders of appraisal rights under 

    Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code,
as applicable (including, without limitation, all appraisal and investment
banking fees); provided, however, that only 50% of such expenses under this
subsection (d) shall be eligible for indemnification; or

  

 (e) any and all claims, allegations, actions, suits, litigations, arbitrations, proceedings by Orcland, Inc. with respect to its warrants to purchase capital stock of the Company. 

  

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Stockholders
shall have no obligations to indemnify the Parent, Merger Sub or Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective affiliates and subsidiaries pursuant
to this Section 8.2 for any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto in connection herewith
or therewith, if at the time such representation and warranty was made by the
Company, Parent knew of such breach by the Company and failed to disclose
such breach in writing to the Company.

  

 Section 8.3 _ Indemnification by Parent._ Parent hereby agrees to indemnify the Stockholders against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the Stockholders arising out of (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith, or (ii) any failure by Parent to perform any of its obligations or covenants set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Parent shall have no obligations to indemnify the Stockholders or their affiliates pursuant to this Section 8.3 for any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents to which Parent is a party or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith, if at the time such representation and warranty was made to Parent, the Company knew of such breach by Parent and failed to disclose such breach in writing to Parent. 

   

 Section 8.4 _ Procedures._ 

  

 (a) The party seeking indemnification under this Article VIII (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice (the "Notice of Claim") to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim by the Indemnified Party, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article VIII; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party clearly demonstrates that the defense of any third party suit, action or proceeding has been materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party\'s failure to give such notice. 

  

 (b) If such Notice of Claim relates to a suit, action or proceeding by a third party, the Indemnifying Party may upon written notice given to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days of the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Notice of Claim, assume control of the 

    defense of such action, suit or proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control such defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate
therein at its own expense; provided that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of such defense and there exists a conflict of interest between the
interests of the Indemnifying Party and those of Indemnified Party with
respect to such claim, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory
to it and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party shall be considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that
the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable judgment that there is a
probability that a claim, suit, action or proceeding may materially adversely
affect (it being understood by the parties hereto that any action relating to
Taxes shall be deemed to "materially adversely affect") it or its rights under
this Agreement other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would
be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, then the Indemnified
Party may, by written notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive
right to defend, compromise, or settle such claim and the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel shall be considered Losses for purposes of this
Agreement; provided however that any such compromise or settlement shall only
be made with written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld). The party controlling such defense shall keep
the other party advised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and
the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by
the other party with respect thereto.

  

 (c) Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For purposes hereof, a party\'s withholding of its consent to any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the other party of a complete irrevocable release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or which requires action (or limits action) other than the payment of money that would be considered to be Losses under this Agreement shall be deemed to be reasonable. 

  

 Section 8.5 _ Limitation of Indemnification; Threshold._ 

  

 (a) Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to satisfy claims for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII solely from the Escrow Amount deposited in the Escrow Account. The procedure for payments from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Escrow Account will not act as a limitation on the obligations of any Stockholder of the Company for indemnifiable amounts arising out of criminal activity or fraud or willful misstatements or omissions by such person in which case such person (or an affiliate of such person) will be liable only to the extent of the Escrow Amount actually received by such person (or affiliate) and any obligation of any Stockholder of the Company for indemnifiable amounts arising out of such criminal activity or fraud or willful misstatements or omissions may be satisfied by the surrender of the Escrow Amount actually received by such person (or affiliate). 

   

 (c) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII until such time as the total amount of all Losses that 

    have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of
the Indemnified Parties, or to which any one or more of them has or have
otherwise become subject, exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate; provided,
however, that if the total amount of such Losses exceeds $100,000, then any
Indemnified Party that has suffered or incurred any Losses shall be entitled
to be held harmless, indemnified against and compensated, reimbursed and paid
for all such Losses.

  

 Section 8.6 _ No Contribution._ By their approval of this Agreement, the Stockholders acknowledge and agree that they shall not have and shall not exercise or assert any right of contribution, indemnification, subrogation or other remedy or right against the Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or other liability to which they may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate delivered in connection herewith or therewith. 

  

 Section 8.7 _ Remedies Available._ Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law, the remedies set forth in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto for any and all losses or other liability sustained or incurred by the parties hereto or the Company Stockholders or their successors or assigns, in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this sentence shall limit or impair the rights and remedies that any party hereto may have for equitable relief. 

  

 Section 8.8 _ Indemnification of Company Employees, Agents, Directors or Officers._ 

  

 (a) Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company (the "Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, assuming the consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such three (3) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue to disposition of any and all such claims. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with the standards set forth in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation reasonably satisfactory to the Company Indemnified Party (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation), which such determination shall be final and binding on the parties thereto. 

  

 (b) If any claim or claims for indemnification under Section 8.8(a) arise or are asserted during the twelve-month period following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to satisfy any Losses resulting from such claim or claims solely from the Escrow Amount, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 Section 9.4 _ Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver, Remedies Cumulative._ No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 

  

 Section 9.5 _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party.

 Section 9.6 _ Entire Agreement._ Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement, the schedules and exhibits hereto, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, undertakings and negotiations, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 Section 9.7 _ Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise except with the written consent of each of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights hereunder to any affiliate thereof so long as Parent remains liable for its obligations hereunder. 

   

 Section 9.8 _ Parties in Interest._ This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and the Stockholder Representative in the performance of his duties hereunder, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

   Section 9.9 _ Counterparts; Facsimile Execution._ This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement may be executed by any party by facsimile signature. 

  

 Section 9.10 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
