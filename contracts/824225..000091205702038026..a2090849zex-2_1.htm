have the right to control such defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense; provided that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and
there exists a conflict of interest between the interests of the Indemnifying Party and those of Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to

relating to Taxes shall be deemed to "materially adversely affect") it or its rights under this Agreement other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification
