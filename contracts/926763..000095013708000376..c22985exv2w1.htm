Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position with
respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules&nbsp;14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or from making such disclosure to the Company Shareholders which, in the judgment
of the Company Board after receiving advice of outside counsel, may be required under applicable
law (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a &#147;stop, look and
listen&#148; statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules&nbsp;14d-9 and 14e-2(a)

furnishing of information or engaging in discussions or negotiations by the Company in accordance
with paragraph (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;7.3 shall not, by themselves, constitute a change, withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation. No change, withdrawal or modification in the
recommendation of the Company Board to the Company Shareholders with respect to this Agreement or
the Plan of Merger shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover law (including Sections&nbsp;302A.671, 302A.673 and 302A.675 of the MBCA) or other state law to be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
