provisions of this Agreement, be superseded at the option of Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the &#147;<U>New Debt Commitment Letters</U>&#148;) replacing existing Debt Commitment Letters,

event, the term &#147;<U>Debt Commitment Letters</U>&#148; as used herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters. Assuming the
Financing is funded and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.3</U>, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters will in the aggregate be sufficient

required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent or Sub under the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters, and, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
