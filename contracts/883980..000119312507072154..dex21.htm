ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Effect on Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any of Parent, Sub, the Company
or the holders of any securities of the Constituent Corporations:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each Share that is owned by the
Company and held in its treasury and each Share that is owned by Parent, Sub
or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (including any Shares acquired
by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to any agreements
with holders of Shares) (" _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.



 

14 (c) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Cancelled Shares, (ii) Shares
held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company which Shares shall remain
outstanding (collectively with Cancelled Shares, " _Excluded Shares_ ")
and (iii) Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and be converted into the
right to receive in cash, without interest, $34.00 per Share (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, each such Share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cancelled in
accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_, and when so cancelled, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of any
such Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without
interest.

(d) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a Person
(a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented
to the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of
the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of
their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section 3.1(c)_, but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand
for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal,
in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
for each such Share, without interest. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

(e) _Adjustment_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, there is a recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or
rights issued in respect of, the Shares (each, an " _Adjustment_ "), the
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to
provide the holders of Shares with the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such Adjustment.

Section 3.2 _Surrender of Shares_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enter into a paying agent agreement with a bank or
trust company selected by Parent that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). As part
of the Closing, immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will deposit or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds
equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Funds
made available  



 

15  to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Sub
or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ __, 
_however_ , that such investments shall only be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard
and Poors Corporation or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case,
no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months (it being
understood that any and all interest or income earned on funds made available
to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted to Parent).
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt cash payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund
lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments.

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective Time of Shares
evidenced by certificates (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of such Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Shares (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section 3.1_. Upon surrender of Shares (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash, without
interest, into which such Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1_, and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Shares so surrendered (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) are registered, provided it shall be a condition to payment of
such Person that with respect to such Shares the letter of transmittal be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall deliver
to the Paying Agent all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Share (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares) shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares
shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Share (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which  



 

16  such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent. As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail
to each holder of Shares represented by book-entry on the records of the
Company or the Companys transfer agent, on behalf of the Company, other than
Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares, a check in the amount of the Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Share so held.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender of Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares. At the
Effective Time, (i) holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and (iii) there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article III_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Shares, including Dissenting Shares.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for twelve months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares)
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ and the
instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders
after the Effective Time shall, after such funds have been delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled, without interest.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date
immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such
date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person entitled
thereto. 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Shares_. If any Shares shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Shares to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon
such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Shares, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect
to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the Merger Consideration as
provided in  _Section 3.1_ represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Shares.

business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,

in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All such Tax Returns are complete and
correct, except where the failure to be complete and correct would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid

writing or assessed in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that have not been paid or otherwise settled or are not otherwise being

the Spun Entity issued to the Company in connection with the Spun Entity
Distribution to not be treated as "qualified property" for purposes of Section

Property used in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except for such Intellectual Property
where the failure to so own, be validly licensed or have the right to use
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company (the " _Company Intellectual Property_
"). No claims are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, (a)
challenging the ownership, enforceability, validity, or use by the Company or
any Subsidiary of any Company Intellectual Property, or (b) alleging that the

to general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law)) and (iv) the Company and its Subsidiaries

to the Company as follows: 

Section 5.1 _Organization_. Parent is a limited partnership and Sub is a

Section 5.2 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Sub has the requisite limited
partnership power or corporate power, as the case may be, and authority to

the consummation by each of Parent and Sub of the Merger and of the other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary

part of each of Parent and Sub other than the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent in its capacity as sole stockholder of Sub, which adoption Parent shall
effect on the date hereof immediately following the execution hereof. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and
(assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Sub enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

Section 5.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except (a) for filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals set forth in _Item 4.5_ of
the Company Letter or as may be required under, and other applicable
requirements of, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the rules and
regulations of the NYSE, state securities laws, foreign and supranational laws
relating to antitrust and anticompetition clearances, and (b) as may be
required in connection with the Taxes described in _Section 7.7_, neither

30  make any notice to, or filing with, or permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any Governmental Entity, (iii) result in a breach of,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give rise to any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or

conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or

Section 5.4 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Sub or any of their representatives specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company or any of its representatives specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. 

Section 5.5 _Litigation_. There is no suit, claim, action, arbitration,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Sub) that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Sub) is subject
to or bound by any outstanding judgment, settlement, order, writ, injunction,
award or decree that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impede the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.6 _Capitalization of Sub; Operations of Parent and Sub_. The
authorized capital stock of Sub consists solely of 1,000 shares of Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sub is, and at
the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent. Neither Parent nor Sub has conducted any business
prior to the date hereof and neither Parent nor Sub has, and prior to the
Effective Time will not have any, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing.

Section 5.7 _Financing_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i)
executed commitment letters from each Equity Provider to provide equity
financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity
Funding Letters_ ") and (ii) executed commitment letters (the " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ ", and, together with the Equity Funding Letters, the "
_Financing Letters_ ") from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit
Suisse Cayman  



 

31  Islands Branch, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman
Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Credit
Partners L.P., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, HSBC Securities (USA)
Inc., Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank, Lehman
Brothers Inc. and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation to provide debt financing
in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to as
the " _Debt Financing_ ," and together with the financing referred to in
_clause (i)_ being collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ "). Other
than as permitted pursuant to _Section 7.11(a)_, none of the Equity Funding
Letters or Debt Commitment Letters has been amended or modified, no such
amendment or modification is contemplated, and the respective commitments
contained in such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. Parent or Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees in connection with the Equity Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment
Letters that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and the Equity
Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if applicable, any
alternative debt commitment letters entered into pursuant to _Section
7.11(a)_) are in full force and effect and are the valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of Parent and Sub and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto. Subject to _Section 7.11(c)_ and _Section
7.14_, one or more of the Debt Commitment Letters may, in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, be superseded at the option of Parent after
the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the
" _New Debt Commitment Letters_ ") replacing existing Debt Commitment
Letters, provided that the terms of the New Debt Commitment Letters shall not
(A) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof or (B) materially delay the
Closing. In such event, the term " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " as used herein
shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so
superseded at the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as set forth in or expressly contemplated by the Equity Funding
Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters. Assuming the Financing is funded and
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.3_, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters
and the Debt Commitment Letters will in the aggregate be sufficient for Sub
and the Surviving Corporation to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration (and
any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or
the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters) and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the
part of Parent or Sub under the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment
Letters, and, as of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Sub on the
date of the Closing.

(b) Neither Parent, Sub nor any member of the Equity Provider Group has (i)
retained any financial advisor on an exclusive basis other than (A) financial
advisors to which the Strategic Review Committee or the Company has consented
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and
(B) Affiliates of any member of the Equity Provider Group or (ii) entered into
any Contract with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of
debt or equity financing on an exclusive basis (or otherwise on  



 

32  terms that would prohibit such provider from providing or seeking to provide
such financing to any third party in connection with a transaction relating
to the Company or its Subsidiaries), in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_
, in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ , for such actions taken after the No-
Shop Period Start Date to the extent permitted pursuant to the second sentence
of _Section 7.11(c)_. Neither Parent, Sub nor any member of the Equity
Provider Group has caused or induced any Person to take any action that, if
taken by Parent, Sub or any member of the Equity Provider Group, would be a
breach of, or would cause to be untrue, any of the representations in this
_Section 5.7(b)_.

Section 5.8 _Limited Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has caused the Guarantors to deliver to the Company duly
executed Limited Guarantees. Each Limited Guarantee is in full force and
effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the applicable
Guarantor, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of such Guarantor
under such Limited Guarantee.

Section 5.9 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or Sub for which the Company could have any liability prior to the
Closing.

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i)
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Subs obligation to consummate
the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ hereof
(for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and
correct in all material respects without giving effect to any "knowledge",
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception),
and (iii) estimates, projections or forecasts provided by the Company to
Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on
assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, and after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing,
and the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any other repayment or
refinancing of existing indebtedness contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Letters, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of
all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.11 _Customers and Strategic Partners_. Neither Parent, Sub nor any
member of the Equity Provider Group has entered into any Contract with any
Material Customer existing on the date hereof or any strategic partner of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Person that has
an ownership interest in a Specified Alliance) existing on the date hereof on
an exclusive basis (or otherwise on terms that would materially impair the
ability of any other Person to make or consummate a Takeover Proposal)
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent,
Sub nor any member of the Equity Provider Group has caused or induced any
Person to take any action that, if taken by Parent, Sub or any member of  



 

33  the Equity Provider Group, would be a breach of, or would cause to be
untrue, any of the representations in this _Section 5.11_. For purposes
of this _Section 5.11_ and _Section 7.14_, a Contract with a Material
Customer or strategic partner is exclusive with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement only if by its terms such Contract relates to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is entered into outside
the ordinary course of business and in such Contract the Material Customer or
strategic partner agrees to treat Parent, Sub and its Affiliates more
favorably than any other Person or group of Persons seeking to make a
Takeover Proposal.

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_. During the two-year period prior to the
Distribution Date, there was no "agreement, understanding, arrangement or
substantial negotiations" regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any transaction to which such contemplated transactions
are "similar", in each case within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.355-7.

this Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and other representatives (such Persons, together with the
Subsidiaries of the Company, collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ")
shall have the right to: (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate and encourage
Takeover Proposals, including by way of providing access to non-public
information to any other Person or group of Persons pursuant to an Acceptable

amendment of any Takeover Proposal). From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in

Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article IX_ , not (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly

otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a Takeover
Proposal. No later than two Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the number of Excluded Parties
and the Company shall provide to Parent (within such two Business Day time
frame), at the Companys option, either (1) a copy of any Takeover Proposal
from an Excluded Party (which, at the option of the Company, may be redacted
to remove the identity of the Excluded Party) or (2) a written summary of the
material terms of any Takeover Proposal from an Excluded Party (it being
understood that such material terms do not have to include the identity of the
Excluded Party).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2(b)_
but subject to the last sentence of this  _Section 6.2(c)_, if, at any time
on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of the Company Representatives
receives a written Takeover Proposal by any Person or group of Persons, which
Takeover Proposal was made on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, (A) the
Company and Company Representatives may contact such Person or group of
Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Company
Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith (i) after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, such as Morgan
Stanley or Evercore, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
could be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the
Company and Company Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal and (y) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover
Proposal. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall
promptly advise Parent of the receipt by the Company of any Takeover Proposal
made on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date or any request for non-public
information made by any Person or group of Persons that has informed the
Company it is considering making a Takeover Proposal or any request
for discussions or negotiations with the Company or the Company
Representatives relating to a Takeover Proposal (in each case within 48 hours
of receipt thereof), and the Company shall provide to Parent (within such 48
hour time frame), at the Companys option, either (i) a copy of any such
Takeover Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (which, at the option of the Company, may be redacted to remove
the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal)
or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Takeover Proposal (it
being understood that such material terms do not have to include the identity
of the Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal). Following
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent informed on a
prompt basis of any material change to the terms and conditions of any
Takeover Proposal (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any amendment
or modification to any Takeover Proposal made by an Excluded Party). The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any  



 

38  confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that,
notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company under
_Section 6.2(b)_ on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue
to engage in the activities described in _clause (i)_ and/or _(ii)_ of
_Section 6.2(a)_ with respect to any Excluded Parties on and after the No-
Shop Period Start Date, including with respect to any amended or revised
proposal submitted by such Excluded Parties on or after the No-Shop Period
Start Date, and this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall not apply with respect thereto;
_provided_ that to the extent set forth therein, the provisions of _Section
6.2(f)_ shall apply. 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal
or offer, on its most recently amended and modified terms, from any Person or
group of Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to any direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of the consolidated assets
(including equity securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company) or
consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 15% or more of
the Shares then outstanding, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the
Shares then outstanding, and any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company that if consummated would result in holders of Shares immediately
prior to such transaction owning less than 85% of the outstanding voting
power of the Company or the resulting parent entity of the Company immediately
following such transaction, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means
any Takeover Proposal, on its most recently amended and modified terms (with
all percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal changed to 50%), that
is on terms that the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, such as Morgan Stanley or Evercore) would, if
consummated, be more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after taking into
account the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (y) after taking into account all
material legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such Takeover
Proposal), regulatory or other aspects of such Takeover Proposal.

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.2_, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation;
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing _clauses
(i)_ and _(ii)_ , whether taken by the Company Board or a committee thereof,
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (iii) cause or allow the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition
agreement or any similar agreement or understanding (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) to implement a Takeover Proposal.

(f) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company has
received a Takeover Proposal that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that
the Company Board or any committee thereof concludes in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving  



 

39  effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to
_clause (2)_ below, if applicable, the Company Board or any
committee thereof may (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to the foregoing  _clause (x)_ and/or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing _clause (y)_ is to be effected, in either case, as
the result of receipt by the Company of a Superior Proposal that is not an
Excluded Superior Proposal, then the Company Board or a committee thereof may
not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing _clause
(x)_ and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing _clause (y)_
unless:

(1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Sub, at
least five calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its
intention to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such
Superior Proposal and/or to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(it being understood that such material terms and conditions do not have to
include the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior
Proposal), and contemporaneously with providing such notice shall have
provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party
making such Superior Proposal and other material documents (provided that such
copies of such agreements and other material documents, may exclude the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal); and

(2) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal and/or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall
cause its legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent and Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Sub
desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

In the event that during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the
Superior Proposal to which the proviso in this  _Section 6.2(f)(i)_ applies
and the Company Board or any committee thereof in its good faith judgment
determines such revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the
purchase price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material
revision), the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and Sub and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.2(f)(i)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the Notice
Period shall be reduced to two calendar days.



 

40 For purposes of this Agreement, " _Excluded Superior Proposal_ " means any
Superior Proposal made at any time by any Excluded Party, provided that the
Excluded Party (i) is not (I) a private equity or hedge fund or (II) a Person
in which (1) private equity or hedge funds or investors therein who have co-
invested therewith, directly or indirectly, as of March 23, 2007 represent
10% or more of the debt or equity financing (excluding debt financing from any
commercial bank so long as such commercial bank and its Affiliates are not
providing equity financing or debt financing convertible or exchangeable into
equity) of such Person or (2) after March 23, 2007, private equity or hedge
funds or investors therein who have co-invested therewith, directly or
indirectly, provide any additional or new debt or equity financing, and, in
the case of each of _clause (1)_ and _(2)_ , as to which no private equity or
hedge fund, directly or indirectly, has a veto right with respect to the
investment and acquisition decisions of such Person or (ii) if the Excluded
Party consists of a group of Persons, then (A) Persons representing, directly
or indirectly, all of the debt and equity financing (excluding debt financing
from any commercial bank so long as such commercial bank and its Affiliates
are not providing equity financing or debt financing convertible or
exchangeable into equity) of such group are not private equity or hedge funds
or investors therein who have co-invested therewith and (B) no private equity
or hedge fund or investors therein who have co-invested therewith, directly
or indirectly, has a veto right with respect to the investment and acquisition
decisions of such group.

(ii) In addition to the rights of the Company Board and any committee thereof
under _clause (i)_ of this  _Section 6.2(f)_ and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board or any committee thereof may, other
than in response to any Takeover Proposal, (x) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or (y) terminate this Agreement if the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; _provided_ that prior to taking either of the
actions set forth in the foregoing _clause (x)_ or _clause (y)_ , the Company
shall take the actions set forth in  _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ of _Section
6.2(f)(i)_ above as if a Superior Proposal that is not an Excluded Superior
Proposal had been received by the Company. No Adverse Recommendation Change
shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any
state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board or any committee thereof from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9
or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
or any committee thereof, after consultation with outside counsel,
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law or is otherwise required under applicable law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders tender
any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal), unless in each case, in
connection therewith, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) effects an
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ _further_ that any such disclosure
(other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board or any
committee thereof  



 

41  expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation at least two Business Days
prior to the Stockholders Meeting if Parent has delivered to the Company a
written request to so reaffirm at least 48 hours (or if 48 hours is
impracticable, as far in advance as is practicable) prior to the time such
reaffirmation is to be made.

Section 6.3 _Conduct of Business of Parent and Sub Pending the Merger_. During
the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor Sub shall engage in any activity of any nature except actions
taken in connection with this Agreement and the Financing, including any
syndication or sell down of the Financing (to the extent not prohibited by
_Article VII_ ).

Section 6.4 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parent or
its Subsidiaries operations. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

ARTICLE VII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 7.1 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) For a period of not less than two years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide all individuals who are employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (including
employees who are not actively at work on account of illness, disability or
leave of absence) (the " _Retained Employees_ "), while employed by
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with salary, cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding any equity-based compensation
opportunities), pension and welfare benefits and perquisites that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the salary, cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding any equity-based compensation
opportunities), pension and welfare benefits and perquisites provided to such
Retained Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained
in this _Section 7.1_ shall be deemed to grant any employee any right to
continued employment after the Effective Time, ensure a continued amount of
commission-based compensation or interfere with the Surviving Corporations
right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform to
applicable law. Parent shall take all necessary action so that each Retained
Employee shall after the Effective Time continue to be credited with the
unused vacation and sick leave credited to such employee through the
Effective Time under the applicable vacation and sick leave policies of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and Parent shall permit or cause the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries to permit such employees to
use such vacation and sick leave in accordance with such policies. Parent
shall take all necessary action so that, for all purposes under each employee
benefit plan (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan) maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which
Retained Employees become eligible to participate as of or after the Effective
Time, each such person shall be given credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries recognized by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



 

42 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.1_ or in  _Section
7.2_, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any particular Benefit Plan or
as requiring the Surviving Corporation to continue (other than as required by
its terms) any written Employment Agreement.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
assume, maintain and honor the bonus and incentive programs for Retained
Employees existing as of the Effective Time and to pay to the Retained
Employees the bonuses they earn under such programs pursuant to the terms
thereof at the end of the applicable bonus determination period that includes
the Effective Time. For a period of not less than two years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain,
without any modification that is adverse to any Retained Employee, the
Company Severance/Change in Control Policies.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Retained Employees and former employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which such
employees and former employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are in effect
with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied under the
corresponding welfare or fringe benefit plan maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries for the Retained Employees and former employees prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Retained Employee and former employee
with credit under any welfare plans in which such employee or former employee
becomes eligible to participate after the Effective Time for any co-payments
and deductibles paid by such Retained Employee or former employee for the
then current plan year under the corresponding welfare plans maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Immediately following
the Effective Time, the parties shall effectuate the necessary amendments to
such plans to achieve the intent of this _Section 7.1(d)_.

(e) The parties do not intend for this Agreement to amend any Benefit Plans
or the terms of any sub-agreements or sub-plans, terms and conditions,
restrictive covenants, or participation requirements thereof, except and to
the extent such amendment is explicitly contemplated by the express language
of this Agreement.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the Merger will
be a "Change in Control" under the Company Stock Plans.

(g) Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree that none of the provisions of
this _Section 7.1_ is intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to enforce any obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation contained
herein.



 

43 Section 7.2 _Equity Awards, Company Stock Purchase Plan and Deferred
Compensation Plan_. 

(a) Unless otherwise agreed between Parent and any holder of a Company Stock
Option or a Company Stock Unit prior to the Effective Time (but in case of
such agreement, only with respect to such Company Stock Options or Company
Stock Units held by such person and only to the extent permitted by applicable
law), the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, at the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option and Company Stock Unit then
outstanding, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled by
the Company in consideration for which the holder thereof shall thereupon be
entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time, a cash payment in
respect of such cancellation from the Company in an amount (if any) equal to
(i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option or Company Stock Unit, as applicable, and (y) in
the case of each Company Stock Option, the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option and, in the case of each Company Stock
Unit, the Merger Consideration, minus (ii) all applicable federal, state and
local Taxes required to be withheld by the Surviving Corporation. The Company
shall, to the extent permitted by law, reduce its estimated tax payments due
by taking into account, for purpose of the calculation of such payments, all
deductions the Company will, upon the closing of the Merger, be entitled to
take in respect of any Company Stock Options that are exercised prior to the
Effective Time, Restricted Stock that vests as a result of the Merger, and all
cash paid in respect of Company Stock Options and Company Stock Units that are
canceled in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) The Company (acting through the Company Board or any committee thereof
administering the applicable Company Stock Plan) shall take all necessary
actions to ensure that all unvested Restricted Stock vests immediately prior
to the consummation of the Merger. Such Shares shall be considered outstanding
for all purposes of this Agreement, including, if applicable, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Article III_ of this
Agreement.

(c) Effective as of April 1, 2007; the Company shall suspend all rights to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock Purchase Plan;
_provided_ that the Company may honor purchase elections made prior to April
1, 2007 with respect to purchases to be made at the end of the first quarter
of 2007 in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan and at
the end of the second quarter of 2007 in accordance with the terms of the
Company Stock Purchase Plan provided that the Company may only honor such
elections by delivery of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
the Capitalization Date which are purchased on the open market for such
purpose. The Company shall terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan as of
the Effective Time.

Section 7.3 _Stockholder Approval; Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
7.3(b)_, the Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement
is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the  



 

44  " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the adoption of
this Agreement by the Company Requisite Vote (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to hold the Stockholders Meeting if the Company Board or any committee
thereof, after consultation with outside counsel, reasonably believes that
holding the Stockholders Meeting would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law. The Company shall, through the Company Board or
any committee thereof, but subject to the right of the Company Board or any
committee thereof to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
_Section 6.2(f)(i)_ or _Section 6.2(f)(ii)_, recommend to its stockholders
that the Company Stockholder Approval be given (the " _Company Recommendation_
") and shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and,
unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall take
all reasonable lawful action to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice and hold the Stockholders
Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms.

(b) The Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and file a
preliminary Proxy Statement as soon as practicable following the date hereof
with the SEC and shall use its reasonable efforts to respond (with the
assistance of Parent) to any comments of the SEC or its staff, and, to the
extent permitted by law, to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such
comments to the satisfaction of the staff; _provided_ that the Company shall
not be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of the Company Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If at any
time prior to the Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall promptly prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and mail to its
stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case to the extent
required by applicable law. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings
(or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
shall include in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by
Parent.

Section 7.4 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice and subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated February 19, 2007, between the
Company and KKR, as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Representatives of KKR (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement), reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and during such period,
the Company shall (and  



 

45  shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) make available to Parent (a) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal
or state securities laws or the federal Tax laws, and (b) all other
information and documents concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall only be provided to the extent that in the reasonable good
faith judgment of the Company, after consultation with legal counsel, such
access or the provision of such information would not violate applicable law;
_provided_ __, _further_ __, that the foregoing shall not require the Company
(i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third Persons or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain
the consent of such third Person to such inspection or disclosure and such
consent was not obtained or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries so long as the Company has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose information described
in this _clause (ii)_ on a basis that does not compromise the Companys or
such Subsidiarys privilege with respect thereto. The parties shall seek
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the proviso to the immediately proceeding sentence applies. All requests for
information made pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ shall be directed to such
Person as may be designated by the Strategic Review Committee. In no event
shall the Company be required to supply to Parent, or Parents officers,
employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, any information
relating to indications of interest from, or discussions with, any
other potential acquirors of the Company, except to the extent necessary for
use in the Proxy Statement or as required by _Section 6.2_. In the event of a
termination of this Agreement for any reason, Parent shall promptly return or
destroy, or cause to be returned or destroyed, all nonpublic information so
obtained from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any copies made of
such documents for Parent. Parent shall hold, and shall cause Representatives
of KKR (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to hold, all information
received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation by any of the parties or their
respective Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements of the other parties set forth herein.

Section 7.5 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as provided below in this  _Section 7.5_, _Section 7.11(b)_ and
_Section 7.11(d)_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the

shall pay the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within two Business Days following such termination);



 

46 (ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement under _Section 9.1(e)(i)_ or 
_Section 9.1(e)(ii)_, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee on the date

prior to the Stockholders Meeting, a written Takeover Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or publicly announced by any Person or group of Persons or
any Person or group of Persons shall have publicly announced that it or they
will make a Takeover Proposal and, in each case, such Takeover Proposal shall
not have been withdrawn or abandoned by such Person or group of Persons or
rejected by the Company, which rejection shall have been made publicly if
such Takeover Proposal or such intent to make a Takeover Proposal was made
publicly (provided that in the case of a rejection by the Company of such
Takeover Proposal, the Company does not enter into a definitive agreement
providing for a Takeover Proposal and a Takeover Proposal is not consummated
(with all percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal changed to 50%)
with such Person or group of Persons within 12 months after the date
of termination), in the case of a termination under _Section 9.1(b)(i)_,

to 50%) or a Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of
Takeover Proposal changed to 50%) shall be consummated, the Company shall pay
the Termination Fee, less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid,
concurrently with the earlier of the entering into of such definitive
agreement or the consummation of such Takeover Proposal; and

(iv) if Parent terminates this Agreement under _Section 9.1(c)_ as a result
of a willful breach by the Company of this Agreement if at the time of such
termination there is no state of facts or circumstances that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ not to be satisfied on or prior to the
Termination Date (other than any state of facts or circumstances that would
permit Parent to terminate this Agreement under _Section 9.1(c)_), the
Company shall pay the Parent Expenses on the date of such termination.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to:

(i) _Section 9.1(f)(i)_ due to any breach of _Section 5.7(b)_, _5.11_ ,
_7.11(c)_ or _7.14_ if at the time of such termination there is no state of

8.1_ not to be satisfied on or prior to the Termination Date (other than any
state of facts or circumstances that would permit the Company to terminate
this Agreement under _Section 9.1(f)(i)_), then Parent shall pay or cause to
be paid $700 million (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the Company or as
directed by the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any
event, within two Business Days following such termination), in each case by
wire transfer of same day funds;



 

47 (ii) _Section 9.1(f)(ii)_, then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
the Parent Termination Fee to the Company or as directed by the Company as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two Business
Days following such termination), in each case by wire transfer of same day
funds; and

(iii) _Section 9.1(f)(i)_ due to a willful breach by Parent or Sub of this
Agreement (other than a breach for which the Company receives a Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _clause (i)_ of this _Section 7.5(c)_) if at the
time of such termination there is no state of facts or circumstances that
would cause the conditions set forth in  _Section 8.1_ not to be satisfied
on or prior to the Termination Date (other than any state of facts or
circumstances that would permit the Company to terminate this Agreement under
_Section 9.1(f)(i)_), then Parent shall pay the Company Expenses to the
Company or as directed by the Company up to $40 million on the date of such
termination by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that if
the Company receives a Parent Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section
7.5(c)(ii)_, it shall not be entitled to receive the Company Expenses under
this _clause (iii)_ of _Section 7.5(c)_).

(d) Each of Parent, Company and Sub acknowledges that the agreements set forth
in this _Section 7.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other party would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this  _Section
7.5_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other party
for the payment set forth in this _Section 7.5_, such paying party shall pay
the other party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date
of payment.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of a termination of this Agreement in connection with which a Termination Fee
is payable to the Person so directed by Parent or, in the case of _Section
7.5(b)(iv)_, the Parent Expenses are payable to the Person so directed by
Parent, payment of such Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, as the case may
be, from the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates against the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such
amounts, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company
shall also be obligated with respect to  _Section 7.5(d)_).



 

48 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
of a termination of this Agreement in connection with which the Company is
entitled to receive a Parent Termination Fee or the Company Expenses, the
Companys right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee or the
Company Expenses from Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ or the
guarantees thereof pursuant to the Limited Guarantees shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Sub, the
Guarantors and any of their respective former, current, or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amounts, none of Parent,
Sub, the Guarantors or any of their respective former, current, or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors,
officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that, in the case of _Section 7.5(c)(iii)_, Parent
shall also be obligated with respect to _Sections 7.5(d)_ , _7.11(b)_ and
_7.11(d)_ ). 

Section 7.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by Parent
and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be a joint press release and thereafter Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable law, fiduciary duties or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.

Section 7.7 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax,
" _Transfer Taxes_ "). All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of any holder of Shares.

Section 7.8 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium" or "control
share acquisition" statute or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company
and the Company Board shall use reasonable best efforts to grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.9 _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law,  _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately  



 

49  determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Persons service as a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the Side A
coverage part (directors and officers liability) of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-
year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Company, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.9_.



 

50 (d) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not
be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Persons (including
their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified
Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.9_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the restated
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable indemnification agreements or laws.

Section 7.10 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
_Sections 6.2_ and _7.3_ , each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to effect the consummation of the Merger as soon
as practicable after the date hereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company,
Parent and Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary to comply promptly with all
legal requirements that may be imposed on itself with respect to the Merger
(which actions shall include furnishing all information requested in
connection with approvals of or filings with any Person or other Governmental
Entity) and shall promptly cooperate with and furnish information to each
other in connection with any such requests to any of them or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and (ii) each of the Company,
Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its or their
reasonable best efforts to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any Governmental Entity or other public or private third Person required
or advisable to be obtained or made by Parent, Sub, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees to
make all appropriate filings, notices and registrations with any Governmental
Entity or other public or private third Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement in order to obtain any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity or other public or
private third Person required or advisable to be obtained or made by Parent,
Sub, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or
the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this  _Section
7.10(b)_, each of the Company (in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(iii)_ of
this _Section 7.10(b)_) and Parent and Sub (in all cases set forth below)
agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

(i) (A) the prompt provision to each and every Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition laws
(" _Government Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-privileged information and
documents as defined  



 

51  under applicable law requested by any Government Antitrust Entity or that
are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) the prompt filing with
the applicable Government Antitrust Entity of all appropriate notices, reports
and registrations required under applicable antitrust or competition laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the proffer and agreement by Parent and Sub of
their willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending
such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, liquidation, disposal and
holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses or other
segments of the Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries (and the
entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such action should be
reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the
actual, anticipated or threatened (x) commencement of any proceeding in any
forum or (y) issuance of any order, decree, decision, determination
or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger by any Government Antitrust Entity; and

(iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding, review or inquiry of
any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including, the
appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated
by _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 7.10(b)_) necessary to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid or remove such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination
or decree so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as
possible to that contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to liquidate First
Financial Bank, a federally-insured, Colorado chartered industrial bank ("
_FFB_ "), or sell or otherwise dispose of FFB to any bank holding company or
financial holding company, as those terms are defined at Section 2 of the
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or a savings and loan holding
company, as that term is defined at Section 10 of the Home Owners Loan Act,
as amended, or, with the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) any other Person, that is
engaged solely in activities permissible for a bank holding company or a
financial holding company, or, pending such liquidation, sale or disposition,
if and to the extent permitted by applicable Governmental Entities, to place
FFB in a trust or otherwise hold FFB and its assets separate, in each case on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Sub, in order to allow the parties
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the  



 

52  date hereof (collectively, a " _Bank Restructuring_ "). The Company shall,
in consultation with Parent, develop a plan to effect the Bank Restructuring
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 21 days following the date
of this Agreement). Parent and Sub shall provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by the Company to effect the Bank Restructuring. The Company shall
and Parent and Sub (as reasonably directed by the Company) shall make all
appropriate filings, applications, notices and registrations with or to, and
enter into agreements or understandings (which shall be on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company) with, the relevant Governmental
Entities and other Persons to effect the Bank Restructuring. In no event shall
such liquidation, sale or other disposition be effective earlier than
immediately prior to the Effective Time unless the Company otherwise elects.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any action to be taken prior to
the Effective Time to effect a Bank Restructuring, which action, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, cannot be reversed or unwound or would be
unreasonably difficult to reverse or unwind, neither Parent nor Sub shall take
such action and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take such action, in each case, unless and until (A) all of
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or waived, (B)
Parent has delivered the irrevocable instructions pursuant to _Section 2.2_
and (C) the Company has received a duly executed certificate from Parent and
Sub certifying that they are ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing.

(d) _Canadian Loan Company_. 

(i) Subject to _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 7.10(d)_, each of Parent, Sub
and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all
consents, authorizations, orders or approval of, or exemptions from, the
Minister of Finance of Canada under the Trust and Loan Companies Act of Canada
and under the Bank Act (Canada) necessary for Parent to acquire indirect
control of the Canadian Loan Company (collectively, the " _TLCA Approval_ ")
as a result of the Merger, including making all appropriate filings,
applications, registrations and notices with or to the Minister of Finance of
Canada.

(ii) Notwithstanding _clause (i)_ of this _Section 7.10(d)_, if the
Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
outside counsel, that obtaining or seeking to obtain the TLCA Approval would
impair, prevent or delay consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or if Parent so elects in its sole
discretion and in the case of such an election by Parent, doing so would not
materially delay the Closing, then Parent, Sub and the Company shall take the
actions contemplated by this _clause (ii)_ of  _Section 7.10(d)_. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell, liquidate or dispose of
the Canadian Loan Company or, pending such liquidation, sale or disposition,
if and to the extent permitted by applicable Governmental Entities, to place
the Canadian Loan Company in a trust or otherwise hold the Canadian Loan
Company and its assets separate, in each case on terms reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and Sub, in order to allow the parties to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof (collectively, a " _Canadian Loan
Company Restructuring_ "). The Company shall, in consultation with Parent,
develop a plan to effect the Canadian Loan Company Restructuring as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within 21 days following the date of
determination by the Company or election by Parent, as the case  



 

53  may be, referred to in the first sentence of this _clause (ii)_ of _Section
7.10(d)_). Parent and Sub shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by the Company to effect such Canadian Loan Company Restructuring. The Company
shall and Parent and Sub (as reasonably directed by the Company) shall make
all appropriate filings, applications, registrations and notices and enter
into agreements or understandings (which shall be on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company) with the relevant Governmental Entities
or other Persons to give effect to the Canadian Loan Company Restructuring. In
no event shall such liquidation, sale or other disposition be effective
earlier than immediately prior to the Effective Time unless the Company
otherwise elects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any action to
be taken prior to the Effective Time to effect a Canadian Loan Company
Restructuring which action, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, cannot
be reversed or unwound or would be unreasonably difficult to reverse or
unwind, neither Parent nor Sub shall take such action and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take such action, in each
case, unless and until (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
have been satisfied or waived, (B) Parent has delivered the irrevocable
instructions pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and (C) the Company has received a
duly executed certificate from Parent and Sub certifying that they are ready,
willing and able to consummate the Closing.

(e) Neither the Company nor Parent nor Sub shall permit any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat,
except for any portion of such meeting during which confidential information
with respect to Affiliates of Parent is to be discussed.

(f) Subject to laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. 

Section 7.11 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letters (provided that, subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 7.11(c)_ and _Section 7.14_, Parent and Sub may replace or amend
the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as the terms
would not (A) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof or (B)
materially delay the Closing), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate



 

54 definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub in the
Debt Commitment Letters that are within their control and comply with their
obligations thereunder, and (iv) enforce their rights under the Debt
Commitment Letters. In the event that all conditions to the Financing Letters
(other than in connection with the Debt Financing, the availability or funding
of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied or, upon funding will be
satisfied, in each case in Parents good faith judgment, and taking into
account in the case of bridge financing the obligation of Parent and Sub to
obtain such bridge financing pursuant to the seventh sentence of this
_Section 7.11(a)_, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund on
the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by taking
enforcement action to cause such lenders and the other Persons providing such
Financing to fund such Financing). If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent and Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms no less favorable to
Parent and Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent and Sub)
than those in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions)
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no
later than the final day of the Marketing Period or, if earlier, the Business
Day immediately prior to the Termination Date. Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice (but in any event not later than 48 hours after the occurrence)
of any material breach by any party to the Financing Letters or of any
condition not likely to be satisfied, in each case, of which Parent or Sub
becomes aware or any termination of the Financing Letters. Parent shall keep
the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that (x) all or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as
privately offered notes is not yet received by Parent or Sub, (y) the
conditions to closing in _Article VIII_ (other than the delivery of the
officers certificates contemplated in _Sections 8.2(a)_ , _8.2(b)_ , 
_8.3(a)_ and _8.3(b)_ and the solvency opinion contemplated by _Section
8.1(d)_) shall have been satisfied or waived and (z) the bridge facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or alternative bridge
financing obtained in accordance with this Agreement) are available in all
material respects on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or described in replacements thereof
on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and Sub or alternative
financing therefor), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge
financing (or replacement or alternative financing) to be used to replace such
privately offered note financing no later than the final day of the Marketing
Period. Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing. For
purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed among the parties hereto,
" _Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive calendar
days after the date hereof (A) during which (1) Parent shall have the Required
Information that the Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.11(b)_ and (2) no event has occurred and no conditions exist that
would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.3_ to fail to be
satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such
20-consecutive-calendar-day period, and (B) the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1_ have been satisfied (other



 

55 than conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier
date that is the date on which the Debt Financing otherwise is obtained;
_provided further_ that if the Marketing Period would not end on or prior to
August 16, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than
September 3, 2007; _provided further_ that if the Marketing Period would not
end on or prior to December 20, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no
earlier than January 2, 2008; and _provided further_ that the Marketing
Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, (i) after the date hereof and
prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, Ernst and Young LLP shall have
withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Documents or (ii) if the financial statements
included in the Required Information that is available to Parent on the first
day of any such 20-consecutive-calendar-day-period would not be sufficiently
current on any day during such 20-consecutive-calendar-day period to permit a
registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of the 20-consecutive-calendar-day
period.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Sub, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause the respective officers,
employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Sub cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, including (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies,
(ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing; _provided_ that any private placement
memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and financial statements
reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor,
(iii) executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency
or interest hedging arrangements or other definitive financing documents or
other certificates, legal opinions and documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral as
may be reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that any obligations
contained in such documents shall be effective no earlier than as of the
Effective Time, (iv) furnishing Parent and Sub and their Financing sources as
promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 30 days prior to the
Termination Date) with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type
required by Regulation S-X (other than Item 3-10 of Regulation S-X, but
including summary guarantor/non-guarantor information of the type customarily
included in offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act) and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the
type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, to consummate the offerings
of debt securities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters at the time
during the Companys fiscal year such offerings will be made; _provided_ ,
that Parent shall provide the Company with a description of the types of
information to be requested under this _clause (iv)_ as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (information required to be
delivered pursuant to this _clause (iv)_ being referred to as, the "
_Required Information_ "), (v) obtaining accountants comfort letters,
accountants consents, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance as
reasonably requested by Parent and (vi) taking all actions reasonably
necessary to (A) permit the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letters to  



 

56  evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets, cash management
and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the
purpose of establishing collateral arrangements; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such access and information shall only be provided to the extent that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company such access or the provision of
such information would not violate applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons or
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality and (B)
establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing, provided that such accounts,
agreements and arrangements will not become active or take effect until the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing
(including the entry into any purchase agreement). None of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or make any other payment other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs or
incur any other liability prior to the Effective Time or provide or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the
foregoing. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its

liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the

this _Section 7.11(b)_) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries). Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this _Section
7.11(b)_). All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent, Sub or their Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 7.11(b)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except (i) to the extent reasonably customary as
part of the syndication of the Debt Financing and (ii) that Parent and Sub
shall be permitted to give such information, subject to their agreeing to keep
such information confidential, to prospective purchasers of the equity of
Parent. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) In no event shall Parent, Sub or any member of the Equity Provider Group
(i) retain any financial advisor on an exclusive basis other than (x)
financial advisors to which the Strategic Review Committee or the Company
consents (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) or (y) Affiliates of any member of the Equity Provider Group or
(ii) enter into any Contract with any bank or investment bank or
other potential provider of debt or equity financing on an exclusive basis
(or otherwise on terms that would prohibit such provider from providing or
seeking to provide such financing to any third party in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries), in the case of
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated  



 

57  hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing in _clause (ii)_ of this _Section
7.11(c)_, but subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including _Section 7.10_ and _Section 7.14_, Parent may seek and obtain
equity commitments and equity financing with respect to the Parent Equity
Share on an exclusive basis from (A) at any time, the Parent Limited Partners
and (B) after the No-Shop Period Start Date, other Persons; _provided_ that,
in the case of each of _clause (A)_ and _clause (B)_ , (1) such Parent
Limited Partners and other Persons are not, and their respective Affiliates
are not, and do not subsequently become, lenders under the Debt Commitment
Letters (or under any alternative debt financing) and are not Excluded Parties
the Company has identified to Parent within 24 hours following the No-Shop
Period Start Date, and (2) doing so does not (y) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Financing set forth in the Financing Letters as of the date
hereof or (z) prevent, impair or materially delay the availability of
the Financing under the Financing Letters or the Closing. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Parent Equity Share_ " means the amount of equity financing
committed to be provided by the Equity Providers pursuant to the Equity
Funding Letters. Neither Parent, Sub nor any member of the Equity Provider
Group shall cause or induce any Person to take any action that, if taken by
Parent, Sub or any member of the Equity Provider Group, would be a breach of,
or would otherwise not permitted by, this _Section 7.11(c)_. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this _Section 7.11(c)_ and
_Section 7.14_, the Company hereby releases Parent and the counterparty
thereto from its obligation under the Confidentiality Agreement not to enter
into discussions, arrangements or understandings with potential sources of
debt or equity financing with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(d) _Debt Tender Offers_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request
by Parent to do so, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
commence offers to purchase and consent solicitations with respect to all of
the outstanding aggregate amount and all other amounts due of those series of
the Companys debt securities listed in _Item 7.11(d)(i)_ of the Company
Letter (the " _Notes_ "), on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon
by Parent and the Company (including in each case the related consent
solicitation, each a " _Debt Tender Offer_ " and collectively, the " _Debt
Tender Offers_ ") and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith;
_provided_ that (A) the Company shall have received from Parent the completed
Offer Documents which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company and its counsel, and (B) Companys counsel shall provide all
legal opinions required in connection with this _Section 7.11(d)_ other than
with respect to such matters set forth on  _Item 7.11(d)(ii)_ of the Company
Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Debt Tender Offers
shall be conditioned on the receipt of requisite consents to amend the
indentures relating to the Notes, the occurrence of the Closing and such
other conditions agreed upon by Parent and the Company, and the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offers to close on
the Closing Date and the Company shall not be required to commence any
Debt Tender Offer until after the No-Shop Period Start Date. Subject to the
preceding sentence, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offers. The Company shall waive
any of the conditions to the Debt  



 

58  Tender Offers (other than the occurrence of the Closing) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Tender Offers or make any
changes to the Debt Tender Offers other than as agreed between Parent and the
Company. The Company need not make any change to the terms and conditions of
the Debt Tender Offers without the Companys prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, _provided_ that such consent shall not be
required for (A) any increase in any consideration payable in the Debt Tender
Offers, (B) any extension of any consent date, price determination date,
settlement date or expiration date, (C) any change in the provisions of the
Note indentures being amended or deleted or in the terms of any such
amendments or (D) for any change that is not material.

(ii) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent, at its own expense,
shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with
the Debt Tender Offers, including the offers to purchase, related consents and
letters of transmittal and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or
supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in
connection with the Debt Tender Offers shall be subject to the prior review
of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable
in form and substance to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Debt Tender Offers any information in the Offer Documents should be
discovered by the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party in writing, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of the
Company to the holders of the applicable Notes.

(iii) The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent, depositary
or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Tender Offers shall be
selected by Parent and the Company shall pay, and Parent shall reimburse the
Company for, the fees and expenses of the foregoing. The Company shall
enter into customary agreements (including indemnities) with such parties so
selected and on terms and conditions acceptable to Parent and the Company.
Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all of
their reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable fees and expenses
of their Representatives) in connection with the Debt Tender Offers promptly
following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs.

(iv) The Company agrees that, promptly following the consent date, assuming
the requisite consents are received, the Company and its Subsidiaries as may
be necessary shall execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing
the Notes, which supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments
described in the Offer Documents and shall become operative immediately
prior to the acceptance of the Notes  



 

59  for payment pursuant to the Debt Tender Offers, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt Tender
Offers). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company
to accept for payment and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to promptly pay for the Notes that have been properly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Tender Offers and,
subject to receipt of the requisite consents, pay for consents validly
delivered and not revoked in accordance with the Debt Tender Offers.

(v) With respect to any series of Notes, if requested by Parent in writing on
a timely basis, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for such series (or
in addition thereto), the Company shall, to the extent permitted by the
indenture governing such series of Notes, (A) issue concurrent with the
Closing a notice of redemption providing for the redemption on a date
agreed with Parent not more than 30 days after the delivery of such notice of
redemption (or such later time required by the indenture governing the
applicable series of Notes) for all of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Notes of such series pursuant to the requisite provisions of the
indenture governing such series Notes, (B) take any actions reasonably
requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary to facilitate the
defeasance, satisfaction and/or discharge of such series pursuant to the
applicable section of the indenture governing such series of Notes, and shall
redeem, defease or satisfy and/or discharge, as applicable, such series in
accordance with the terms of the indenture governing such series of Notes at
the Effective Time; _provided_ that prior to the Company being required to
take any of the actions described in _clause (A)_ or _(B)_ above that cannot
be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall
have irrevocably deposited with the trustee under the indenture governing
such series of Notes sufficient funds to effect such redemption or
satisfaction and discharge; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Companys
counsel shall provide all legal opinions required in connection with any such
redemption or satisfaction and discharge.

(vi) Parent shall reimburse the Company for its reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses incurred pursuant to this _Section 7.11(d)_. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interests, awards, judgments, and penalties incurred
or suffered by them in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this
_Section 7.11(d)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have any
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or Person to the
extent that any such damages suffered or incurred arose from disclosure
provided by the Company that is determined to have contained a
material misstatement or omission.

Section 7.12 _Resignations_. Except as otherwise agreed by Parent, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver to Parent at or
prior to the Closing (a) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of all directors of the Company and, as specified by Parent
reasonably in advance of the Closing, any officers of the Company and any
directors of the Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case, effective at the
Effective Time and (b) all documents and filings, completed and executed by
the appropriate directors, officers and representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, that are necessary to record the resignations contemplated
by the preceding _clause (a)_. Upon the written request of Parent, as
specified by Parent reasonably in advance of the Closing, the Company will
use its reasonable efforts to seek to obtain the resignation of any or all
directors of Subsidiaries of the Company or, at the option of the Company
remove such directors, in each case, effective as of the Effective Time.



 

60 Section 7.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other in writing promptly after becoming aware of (a) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of such
party to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it
pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.13_ shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to either party, and the failure to deliver any
such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
; _provided_ , _further_ , that the delivery of any notice under this _Section
7.13_ shall not cause the failure of any condition set forth in _Article
VIII_ to be satisfied nor shall the delivery of any such notice be deemed an
admission that any condition in _Article VIII_ is not or will not be satisfied
or that there has been any Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Material
Adverse Change.

Section 7.14 _No Exclusive Arrangements._ Neither Parent, Sub nor any member
of the Equity Provider Group will enter into any Contract with any Material
Customer or any strategic partner of the Company or Affiliate of a strategic
partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Person
that has an ownership interest in a Specified Alliance) on an exclusive basis
(or otherwise on terms that would materially impair the ability of any other
Person to make or consummate a Takeover Proposal) relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent, Sub nor any member of the
Equity Provider Group shall cause or induce any Person to take any action
that, if taken by Parent, Sub or any member of the Equity Provider Group,
would be a breach of, or would otherwise not be permitted by, this _Section
7.14_.

Section 7.15 _Cooperation With Solvency Opinion_. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (a) make
available their respective officers, agents and other representatives on a
customary basis and upon reasonable notice and (b) provide or make available
such information and documents concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and, in the case of Parent,
the Financing, as may reasonably be requested by such appraisal firm in
connection with the preparation and delivery of the opinion described in
_Section 8.1(d)_.

been satisfied or waived.

Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or

officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates except with respect to the
Limited Guarantees, _Section 7.5_, _Section 7.11(d)_, this _Section 9.2_
and _Article X_ and the expense reimbursement and indemnification provisions
of  _Section 7.11(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to _Sections

liability for any willful or knowing breach hereof.



 

66 Section 9.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors, at

of the parties hereto.

Section 9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

(b) The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the Delaware

in which case, in any state or federal court located in Delaware) solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Sub may
assign this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to an Affiliate provided
that any such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the
rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement or, after the
Closing, in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries so long as, in each case, such assignment does not release or
relieve the assigning party from its obligations hereunder if the assignee
fails to perform such obligations. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 10.8 _Enforcement of this Agreement_. (a) The Company agrees that to
the extent it has incurred losses or damages in connection with this
Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Sub for such
losses or damages shall be limited to $700 million inclusive of any amounts
owed under _Sections 7.5(c)_ , _7.5(d)_ , _7.11(b)_ and _7.11(d)_ , (ii) the
maximum liability of each Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited
to the express obligations of such Guarantor under its Limited Guarantee, and
(iii) in no event shall the Company seek to recover any money damages in
excess of such amount from Parent, Sub, the Guarantors or their respective
Representatives and Affiliates in connection therewith.

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
Company. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Sub shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition
to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity. The
parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Sub or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and that the Companys
sole and  



 

70  exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set
forth in _Sections 7.5(c)_ and _Section 10.8(a)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches by Parent or Sub
that would cause irreparable harm, and to enforce specifically the provisions
of this Agreement solely with respect to the obligation to adopt this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.2_, the confidentiality provisions of
_Sections 7.4_ and _7.11(b)_ and the provisions of _Section 7.11(c)_ and 
_7.14_ (provided that if the Company obtains an injunction with respect to a
breach of _Section 5.2_, _7.11(c)_ or _7.14_ such injunction shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates as a result of such breach and
the Company shall not be entitled to a Parent Termination Fee or any other
payment from Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as a result of such
breach). 

Section 10.9 _Obligations of Subsidiaries and Equity Group Members_. Whenever
this Agreement requires (a) any Subsidiary of Parent (including Sub) or of
the Company to take or not take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, to cause such Subsidiary to take or not take such action or (b) any
member of the Equity Provider Group to take or not take any action, such
requirement shall also be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause such member to take or not take such action.

Section 10.10 _Specified Alliances_. Except to the extent expressly indicated
in _Sections 4.9_ , _4.12_ and _4.16_ and the second sentence of _Section
6.1_, no representation or warranty is made by the Company regarding or with
respect to any Specified Alliance and no covenant or agreement of the Company
shall be deemed to apply to any Specified Alliance or the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries actions or inactions with respect to any Specified Alliance.

Section 10.11  _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The parties have
participated jointly in negotiation and drafting this Agreement. In the event
that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

(b) The Company may have set forth information in the Company Letter in a
section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it
relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Letter shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement.



 

71 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized all as of
the date first written above.
