         2.3      Certain Provisions Regarding Assignments.

                  (a)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
         notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
         assign or transfer any Contract or other Asset or any claim, right,
         benefit or obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom if (i) an
         assignment or transfer thereof, without the Consent of a third party
         thereto, would constitute a breach or violation thereof or would in any
         way adversely affect the rights (upon transfer) of the Purchaser under
         such Contract or other Asset or result in the loss or cancellation
         thereof and (ii) such Consent is not obtained at or prior to the
         Closing ("Restricted Asset") (it being understood that this Section
         2.3(a) shall in no way limit any parties' obligations under Section
         6.3(c)).

                  (b)      If the parties are not successful in obtaining a
         Consent at or prior to the Closing, then (i) the Seller shall continue
         to keep the applicable Restricted Asset in effect in accordance with
         its terms and shall provide the Purchaser with the benefits of the
         Restricted Asset in question accruing after the Closing Date to the
         extent that the Seller may provide such benefits (A) in a manner not in
         violation of the terms of such Restricted Asset (and subject to Section
         2.3(d) below) and (B) without incurring any material expense or
         otherwise taking any material actions or measures (such as hiring
         additional employees) and (ii) if the Seller provides such benefits to
         the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall perform at its sole expense the
         obligations of the Seller to be performed after the Closing under the
         Restricted Asset in question. Once a Consent for the sale, assignment,
         assumption, transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Restricted Asset is
         obtained, the Seller shall promptly assign, transfer and deliver such
         Restricted Asset to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall assume the
         obligations under such Restricted Asset that relate to the period from
         and after the date of assignment, transfer and delivery of such
         Restricted Asset to the Purchaser. The terms of this Section 2.3(b)
         shall not apply with respect to Shared Contracts, it being understood
         that the treatment of Shared Contracts is addressed in Section 2.3(c).

                  (c)      Prior to the Closing and subject to the provisions
         set forth in Schedule 7.9 with respect to certain Shared Contracts, the
         Seller and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to
         work together (and, if necessary and desirable, to work with the third
         parties to the Shared Contracts) in an effort to (i) divide, modify
         and/or replicate (in whole or in part) the respective rights and
         obligations under and in respect of the Shared Contracts and (ii) if
         possible, novate the respective rights and obligations under and in
         respect of the Shared Contracts, such that, effective as of the
         Closing, (A) the Purchaser is the beneficiary of the post-Closing
         rights and is responsible for the post-Closing obligations related to
         that portion of the Shared Contract included in the Purchased Contracts
         (the "Access Portion") (so that, subsequent to the Closing, the Seller
         shall have no post-Closing rights or post-Closing obligations with
         respect to the Access Portion of the Shared Contract) and (B) the
         Seller is the beneficiary of the rights and is responsible for the
         obligations related to the Shared Contract other than the Access
         Portion (the "Non-Access Portion") (so that, subsequent to the Closing,
         the Purchaser shall have no rights or obligations with respect to the
         Non-Access Portion of the Shared Contract). If the parties are not able
         to enter into an arrangement to formally divide, modify and/or
         replicate one or more Shared Contracts prior to the Closing as
         contemplated by the

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

         previous sentence, then (i) the Purchaser shall be entitled to the
         benefits of the Access Portion of any such Shared Contract accruing
         after the Closing Date to the extent that the Seller may provide such
         benefits (A) in a manner not in violation of the terms of such Shared
         Contract (and subject to Section 2.3(d) below) and (B) without
         incurring any material expense or otherwise taking any material actions
         or measures (such as hiring additional employees) and (ii) if the
         Seller provides such benefits to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
         perform at its sole expense the obligations of the Seller to be
         performed after the Closing under the Access Portion of such Shared
         Contract.

                  (d)      If any Consent with respect to a Restricted Asset is
         not obtained or any division, modification or replication with respect
         to a Shared Contract is not procured prior to the Closing, the Seller
         and the Purchaser shall cooperate (at their own expense) in any lawful
         and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by the Purchaser under
         which the Purchaser shall obtain the economic claims, rights and
         benefits under the Restricted Asset or Shared Contract with respect to
         which the Consent has not been obtained in accordance with this
         Agreement. Such reasonable arrangement may include subcontracting,
         sublicensing or subleasing to the Purchaser of any and all rights of
         the Seller, the Parent or Marconi IP under such Restricted Asset or
         Access Portion of a Shared Contract. To the extent the Purchaser
         receives the economic claims, rights and benefits under a Restricted
         Asset or Shared Contract as set forth above, the Purchaser shall be
         responsible for the Assumed Obligations, if any, arising under such
         Restricted Asset or Access Portion of a Shared Contract.

         2.4      Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
2.1 and 2.2, neither the Seller nor Marconi IP shall sell, assign, convey,
transfer or deliver to the Purchaser or AFCNA, and neither the Purchaser nor

                  (a)      The total consideration for the Assets shall consist
         of (i) the assumption by the Purchaser of the Assumed Obligations and
         (ii) the payment of $240,000,000 to the Seller (for itself and as agent

                  (b)      All payments made hereunder shall be made in
         accordance with Section 13.4 and to such account or accounts as the
         receiving party shall designate in writing to the paying party.

         3.2      Purchase Price Adjustment.

                  (a)      The Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable, and in
         any event no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, (i)
         prepare the initial draft of a statement (the "Statement of Working
         Capital") setting forth, as of 12:01 a.m. (central standard time) on
         the Closing Date, the amount equal to (y) the aggregate of the Net
         Inventory, the Net Accounts Receivable and the Prepaids less (z) the
         aggregate of the Net Accounts Payable, the Accrued Compensation and
         Benefits, the Other Current Liabilities and the Special Warranty
         Reserve (such net amount being the "Closing Working Capital") and (ii)
         deliver the same to the Seller, together with a certificate from the
         Purchaser's independent auditors to the effect that the initial draft
         Statement of Working Capital has been prepared in accordance with
         Section 3.2(g).

                  (b)      The Seller and the Seller's independent auditors
         shall review the initial draft Statement of Working Capital during the
         sixty (60)-day period commencing on the date that the Seller receives
         the initial draft Statement of Working Capital. At or prior to the end
         of such sixty (60)-day period, the Seller shall either:

                           (i)      deliver a notice to the Purchaser confirming
         that no adjustments are proposed by the Seller to the initial draft
         Statement of Working Capital or the Purchaser's calculation of Closing
         Working Capital (a "Notice of Acceptance"); or

                           (ii)     (deliver a notice to the Purchaser to the
         effect that the Seller disagrees with the initial draft Statement of
         Working Capital and/or the Purchaser's calculation of Closing Working
         Capital (a "Notice of Disagreement"), specifying the nature of such
         disagreement and the adjustments that the Seller seeks to the initial
         draft Statement of Working Capital and/or the calculation of Closing
         Working Capital (collectively, the "Proposed Adjustments").

                  (c)      To the extent that there are any Proposed
         Adjustments, the Purchaser will, no later than thirty (30) days after
         receipt of the Proposed Adjustments, notify the Seller which, if any,
         of the Proposed Adjustments it accepts or rejects. The Seller and the

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

         Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that
         remain in relation to the Proposed Adjustments and to reach agreement
         in writing on any Proposed Adjustments not accepted by the Purchaser.
         If any of the Proposed Adjustments are not so resolved (the "Unresolved
         Adjustments") within forty-five (45) days after the Purchaser's receipt
         of the Seller's notice of the Proposed Adjustments, the Unresolved
         Adjustments may be submitted at the request of either the Seller or the
         Purchaser to the Cleveland office of PricewaterhouseCoopers (the
         "Accounting Firm") for arbitration. The scope of the review by the
         Accounting Firm shall be limited to a determination of (i) whether the
         portions of the initial draft Statement of Working Capital and the
         calculation of Closing Working Capital related to the Unresolved
         Adjustments were prepared in accordance with Section 3.2(g) and (ii)
         based on its determinations of the matters described in clause (i), a
         final calculation of the Closing Working Capital. The Accounting Firm
         is not to make or be asked to make any determination other than as set
         forth in the previous sentence. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use
         reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render its
         written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as
         practicable and, if at all possible, within thirty (30) days after such
         submission of the Unresolved Adjustments. Judgment may be entered upon
         the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having
         jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
         enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred
         pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) shall be borne equally by the Seller,
         on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand. The fees and
         disbursements of the Purchaser's independent auditors incurred in
         connection with the preparation and certification of the draft
         Statement of Working Capital and their review of any Proposed
         Adjustments or Unresolved Adjustments shall be borne by the Purchaser,
         and the fees and disbursements of the Seller's independent auditors
         incurred in connection with their review of the draft Statement of
         Working Capital, the working papers of the Purchaser's independent
         auditors and any Proposed Adjustments or Unresolved Adjustments shall
         be borne by the Seller.

                  (d)      The Statement of Working Capital shall become final
         and binding on all parties upon the earliest of (i) the date that a
         Notice of Acceptance is delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to Section
         3.2(b)(i) (in which case the final Closing Working Capital shall be as
         set forth in the Statement of Working Capital delivered pursuant to
         Section 3.2(a)), (ii) the date that is one (1) day after the sixty
         (60)-day review period specified in Section 3.2(b) has ended if no
         Notice of Disagreement has been delivered by the Seller to the
         Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(ii) during such sixty (60)-day
         period (in which case the final Closing Working Capital shall be as set
         forth in the Statement of Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section
         3.2(a)), (iii) the date of an agreement in writing by the Seller and
         the Purchaser that the Statement of Working Capital, together with any
         modifications thereto agreed by the Seller and the Purchaser, are final
         and binding (in which case the final Closing Working Capital shall be
         as so agreed upon by the parties) and (iv) the date on which the
         Accounting Firm finally resolves in writing any disputed matters (in
         which case the final Closing Working Capital shall be as determined by
         the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 3.2(c)).

                  (e)      The Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its
         independent auditors with reasonable access to the books, records,
         working papers and senior management and

                                      -32-

         employees of the Access Business and shall cause its independent
         auditors to provide reasonable access to their working papers prepared
         for the purpose of the certificate rendered under Section 3.2(a) as the
         Seller and its independent auditors may request in connection with the
         finalization of the Statement of Working Capital or calculation of
         Closing Working Capital.

                  (f)      In the event the final Closing Working Capital (as
         provided in Section 3.2(d)) is greater than or less than the Benchmark
         Amount by more than $100,000, the Purchase Price shall be increased by
         the amount by which the final Closing Working Capital (as provided in
         Section 3.2(d)) exceeds the Benchmark Amount, or decreased by the
         amount by which the final Closing Working Capital (as provided in
         Section 3.2(d)) is less than the Benchmark Amount. The Purchase Price
         as so increased or decreased shall hereafter be referred to as the
         "Adjusted Purchase Price." If the Purchase Price is less than the
         Adjusted Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall, within two (2) Business
         Days after the Statement of Working Capital becomes final and binding
         on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in immediately available
         funds to one or more accounts designated by the Seller of the amount of
         such difference together with a sum equivalent to interest thereon at a
         rate equal to the LIBOR Rate, accrued from the Closing Date to and
         including the date of payment and calculated on the basis of the actual
         number of days elapsed divided by 360. If the Purchase Price is more
         than the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Seller shall, within two (2)
         Business Days after the Statement of Working Capital becomes final and
         binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in immediately
         available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser of the amount
         of such difference together with a sum equivalent to interest thereon
         at a rate equal to the LIBOR Rate, accrued from the Closing Date to and
         including the date of payment and calculated on the basis of the actual
         number of days elapsed divided by 360. "LIBOR Rate" shall mean the rate
         of interest announced publicly by the British Bankers Association as
         its three (3)-month LIBOR rate for U.S. dollars on the Business Day
         immediately following the day on which the Statement of Working Capital
         becomes final. The parties agree that any amounts paid pursuant to this
         Section 3.2(f) shall be allocated in a manner that is consistent with
         the allocation of the Purchase Price as set forth in Section 3.3.

                  (g)      The Statement of Working Capital shall be prepared in
         the same way and using the same accounting policies, principles, bases
         and methods and using the same level of prudence as used in the
         preparation of the Management Accounts specified in Schedule 4.4(a),
         subject to the Calculation Principles referred to below.
         Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing sentence, the Statement
         of Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with the rules of
         calculation specified in Schedule 3.2(g) (the "Calculation
         Principles"). For purposes of the preparation of the Statement of
         Working Capital, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between
         the accounting policies, principles, bases and methods referred to in
         the first sentence of this Section 3.2(g) and the Calculation
         Principles, the Calculation Principles shall control.

         3.3      Allocation of Consideration for Assets. Within 90 days
following the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller and their respective
Affiliates shall consult with each other and agree upon the allocation of the
Purchase Price among the Assets and file all necessary Tax Returns

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

and other forms (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) to report the
transactions contemplated herein for U.S. federal, state, local and non-United
States income Tax purposes in accordance with such allocation, and shall not
take any position inconsistent with such allocation. The parties agree and
acknowledge that such allocation will be in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the
appraisals of the Assets conducted on behalf of the Purchaser following the
Closing. Any adjustment to the Purchase Price for the Assets shall be allocated
as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1060-1, and, in the event of such
adjustment, the Purchaser and the Seller agree to revise and amend Form 8594
within 30 days of such adjustment.

         the applicable other Marconi Entity, as the case may be, and to the
         extent a party thereto, enforceable against each of them (to the extent

         capital stock or other securities of the Parent or any of its
         Affiliates (other than approval of FS Holdings Corp. as the sole
         shareholder of the Seller and the approval of the Seller as the sole

<PAGE>

         Entities of this Agreement and their respective Related Agreements, and
         the consummation by the Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP and, solely with
         respect to the Cross License Agreement, the other Marconi Entities of
         the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not
         conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or

         to a loss of a material benefit under, or to increased, additional,
         accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person under,
         or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
         assets of the Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP or, solely with respect to
         the Cross License Agreement, the other Marconi Entities under, any
         provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other

         Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP or, solely with respect to the Cross
         License Agreement, the other Marconi Entities, other than (A) in the
         case of clause (ii) above, any conflict, violation or other such item
         that does not constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect or a Seller
         Material Adverse Effect and (B) in the case of clauses (iii), (iv) and
         (v) above, any conflict, violation or other such item that does not
         constitute a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

         4.4      Management Accounts. Schedule 4.4(a) sets forth the statement
of assets and liabilities to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement as of
September 30, 2003 ("Balance Sheet") and the statement of operating profit of
the Access Business for the year ended March 31, 2003 and the six-month interim
period ended September 30, 2003 (together with the Balance Sheet, the
"Management Accounts"). Except as set forth on Schedule 4.4(b), the Management
Accounts have been (a) prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United Kingdom at the time prepared, consistently applied (as
modified by the exceptions set forth on Schedule 4.4(b), the "Applicable
Accounting Principles") and (b) properly extracted from the Seller's books and
records. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.4(c), on the basis of the Applicable
Accounting Principles, the Balance Sheet fairly presents in all material
respects as of September 30, 2003 the assets and liabilities of the Access
Business to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement. The Benchmark Amount was
properly extracted and calculated from the Management Accounts using the same
level of prudence as used in the preparation of the Management Accounts, giving
effect to the Calculation Principles.

         4.5      No Other Assumed Liabilities. Except for the Assumed
Obligations or as set forth on Schedule 4.5, there is no Liability of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates which will become a Liability of the Purchaser
following the Closing, except:

                  (a)      those set forth or reflected in the Balance Sheet
         which have not been paid or discharged since the date thereof;

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

                  (b)      those arising under agreements or other commitments
         to be expressly assumed by the Purchaser at the Closing; and

                  (c)      those arising in the ordinary course of business
         consistent with past practices since September 30, 2003.

         4.6      No Adverse Effects or Changes. Since September 30, 2003, there
has not been a Business Material Adverse Effect. Except (a) with respect to the
Excluded Assets and the Retained Obligations, (b) as set forth in Schedule 4.6
or (c) as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement, since September 30,
2003, the Access Business has (i) been conducted in the ordinary course and in
substantially the same manner as previously conducted and (ii) made reasonable
efforts consistent with past practices to preserve the relationships of the
Access Business with material customers, suppliers and distributors.

         4.7      Title to Assets; Affiliate Ownership of Assets.

                  (a)      Except as set forth in Schedule 4.7(a), the Seller
         (i) has title to, and is the lawful owner of, all of the owned Assets
         (other than the Transferred Intellectual Property, the title to which
         is addressed exclusively in Section 4.13), free and clear of any Lien
         other than Permitted Liens and (ii) has a valid leasehold or license
         interest in or to all the assets that are the subject of personal
         property leases or licenses included in the Purchased Contracts (other
         than licenses related to Intellectual Property, the validity of the
         leasehold or license interest of which is addressed exclusively in
         Section 4.13). Except as set forth in Schedule 4.7(a) and subject to
         obtaining and making all applicable Consents, (A) the Seller has the
         full right to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver the Assets
         (other than the Transferred Intellectual Property) to the Purchaser or
         AFCNA, as the case may be, and (B) at the Closing the Seller shall
         convey to the Purchaser or AFCNA, as the case may be, good title to all
         of the Assets (other than the Transferred Intellectual Property, the
         transfer of which is addressed exclusively in Section 4.13), free and
         clear of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens). This Section 4.7(a)
         does not apply to title to Intellectual Property, it being agreed that
         the sole and exclusive representations and warranties regarding title
         to Intellectual Property are set forth in Section 4.13.

                  (b)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7(b), no Affiliate
         of the Seller (other than Marconi IP) owns, licenses or leases any
         assets or properties used or held for use in the conduct or operation
         of the Access Business.

         4.8      Access Business Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.8,
the Assets are sufficient for the conduct of the Access Business by the
Purchaser and AFCNA, operating together, following the Closing in substantially
the same manner as currently conducted by the Seller and as was conducted by the
Seller on September 30, 2003.

         4.9      Real Property.

                  (a)      Other than the Bedford Facility and the real property
         that is the subject of the Excluded Leases, the Seller does not own or
         lease any real property that is primarily used in connection with the
         Access Business. The Seller and CAMI Industrial LLC have entered into a
         lease with respect to the Bedford Facility pursuant to which the Seller
         will

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

         lease the Bedford Facility effective upon the closing of the
         transaction contemplated by the Bedford Sale Agreement (the "CAMI
         Transaction"). A true and correct copy of such lease is attached hereto
         as Exhibit L (the "Bedford Lease"). Other than the Jabil
         Rationalization Agreement, the Bedford Sale Agreement and the Bedford
         Lease (it being understood that the effectiveness of the Bedford Lease
         is conditional on the closing of the CAMI Transaction), there are no
         other agreements or arrangements whatsoever relating to the Seller's
         right to occupy the Bedford Facility. Except as set forth in Schedule
         4.9(a), (i) the Seller is not in default under the Jabil
         Rationalization Agreement (nor does there exist any condition which,
         upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would cause
         such a default) and (ii) to the Seller's knowledge, no other party is
         in default under the Jabil Rationalization Agreement (nor does there
         exist any condition which, upon the passage of time or the giving of
         notice or both, would cause such a default). Upon the closing of the
         CAMI Transaction, the Bedford Lease shall be valid, binding and in full
         force and effect against the Seller, and, to the Seller's knowledge,
         against the other party thereto in accordance with its terms. Further,
         assuming the closing of the CAMI Transaction, the Seller warrants that
         it will not have breached the provisions of the Bedford Lease or be in
         default under the Bedford Lease (nor will there exist any condition
         which, upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would
         cause such a breach or default). To the Seller's knowledge, there is no
         pending or threatened proceeding or action by any Governmental
         Authority to condemn or take by the power of eminent domain (or to
         purchase in lieu thereof) all or any part of the Bedford Facility.
         Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(a), (i) the Bedford Facility is
         supplied with utilities and other services sufficient to operate the
         Access Business as presently conducted and (ii) the operation of the
         Access Business by the Seller at the Bedford Facility has not since
         January 1, 2003 violated and does not violate in any material manner
         any applicable building code, zoning requirement, or zoning, building
         use or occupancy classification or statute relating to the Bedford
         Facility. If, at the time of the Closing, the Bedford Lease is in
         effect, the Seller warrants that it will not have transferred,
         mortgaged or assigned any interest in such Bedford Lease. The Bedford
         Facility is suitable for the conduct of the Access Business as
         conducted as of September 30, 2003 and as currently conducted.

                  (b)      The Seller has the right to transfer its right to
         occupy the Bedford Facility under the Jabil Rationalization Agreement
         to the Purchaser without the consent of Jabil. In the event the CAMI
         Transaction does not close, the Seller has the right to cause Jabil to
         sell the Bedford Facility to the Seller under the Jabil Rationalization
         Agreement.

         4.10     Personal Property; Leased Personal Property. Schedule 4.10(a)
includes an accurate and complete list as of October 31, 2003 of all of the
Personal Property having an individual book value in excess of $10,000. Schedule
4.10(b) sets forth an accurate and complete list of each lease of personal
property used primarily in the Seller's conduct or operation of the Access
Business having aggregate minimum lease payments in excess of $10,000 (the
"Material Personal Property Leases"). The Seller has made available to the
Purchaser true and complete copies of the Material Personal Property Leases
except as noted on Schedule 4.10(b). All Personal Property, whether owned or
leased, is in all material respects in good working order and has been
maintained in all material respects in accordance with the past practice of the
Access Business.

                                      -38-

         4.11     Customers and Distributors; Suppliers.

                  (a)      Except for the customers named in Schedule 4.11(a),
         the Access Business does not have any customer to which it made more
         than five percent (5%) of its sales during its most recent full fiscal
         year or during the six month period ended September 30, 2003. Except as
         set forth in Schedule 4.11(a) and except for fluctuations in volume in
         the ordinary course of business, since September 30, 2003 there has not
         been (i) to the Seller's knowledge, any material adverse change in the
         relationship of the Access Business with any customer named in Schedule
         4.11(a) or (ii) except for changes in prices in the ordinary course of
         business, any change in any material term (including credit terms) of
         the sales agreements or related agreements with any such customer.
         Since January 1, 2002, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates has
         received any written complaint concerning the products and services of
         the Access Business from a purchaser thereof, nor has the Seller nor
         any of its Affiliates had any such products returned by a purchaser
         thereof, other than complaints and returns that, individually or in the
         aggregate, do not constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Except for the suppliers named in Schedule 4.11(b),
         the Access Business has not purchased, from any single supplier, goods
         or services for which the aggregate purchase price exceeds five percent
         (5%) of the total value of goods and services purchased by the Access
         Business during its most recent full fiscal year or during the six
         month period ended September 30, 2003. Except as set forth in Schedule
         4.11(b) and except for fluctuations in volume in the ordinary course of
         business, since September 30, 2003, there has not been (i) to the
         Seller's knowledge, any material adverse change in the relationship of
         the Access Business with any supplier named in Schedule 4.11(b) or (ii)
         except for changes in prices in the ordinary course of business, any
         change in any material term (including credit terms) of the supply
         agreements or related arrangements with any such supplier.

                  (c)      Schedule 4.11(c) sets forth a list of each material
         distributor or sales representative of the products of the Access
         Business and (i) indicates whether such distributor or sales
         representative has a written contract or oral arrangement with the
         Access Business and (ii) only with respect to such oral arrangements,
         contains a description of the terms of such oral arrangement with the
         Access Business with respect to territory, exclusivity and the term of
         the arrangement. To the Seller's knowledge, no Affiliate of the Seller
         has entered into any arrangements that would contractually prevent the
         Purchaser from distributing or selling any products of the Access
         Business in the United States or Canada.

         4.12     Proceedings.

                  (a)      Except as set forth in Schedule 4.12, there are no
         Proceedings pending, or, to the Seller's knowledge, Proceedings or

         conduct the Access Business or (B) any Asset or Assumed Obligation or
         (ii) in default under any Judgment, which default would reasonably be
         expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the Purchaser's
         ability to conduct the Access Business or (B) any Asset or Assumed
         Obligation. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.12, there is not any
         Proceeding or claim by the Seller, the Parent or Marconi IP pending, or
         which any of them intends to initiate, against any other Person arising

         Trademarks and Transferred Technology that are registered or subject to
         an application of registration, Schedule 4.13(a) sets forth a list of

         all such Transferred Patents, Transferred Trademarks and Transferred
         Technology that is Intellectual Property are in full force and effect,
         and each of the Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP and their respective
         Affiliates, to the extent applicable, has, in a timely manner
         (including extensions), taken those necessary administrative actions
         (including the payment of any applicable fees) that would reasonably be

         Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP and their respective Affiliates for the
         Transferred Patents, Transferred Trademarks and Transferred Technology
         remain in full force and effect.

         result of the failure of Personnel to enter into an Employee IP
         Agreement under circumstances in which, under applicable Law, ownership
         of Intellectual Property rights in Transferred Intellectual Property
         developed or conceived by such Personnel would vest on creation in such
         Personnel and not in the Seller or Marconi IP, either the Parent, the

         in connection with the Access Business, all rights that accrue to a
         sole owner, without payment to any other Person, to all Transferred
         Patents, Transferred Trademarks and Transferred Technology. The
         consummation of the Acquisition, the ownership of the Access Business
         by the Purchaser and AFCNA and the other transactions contemplated
         hereby do not and will not conflict with, alter or impair any such sole
         ownership rights, other than as is not within the Seller's knowledge or
         would not reasonably be expected to result in any material liability or
         have any Business Material Adverse Effect on the continued conduct of
         the Access Business, as such is currently conducted.

                  (d)      Schedule 4.13(d) sets forth an accurate and complete
         list of all licenses, sublicenses and other agreements pursuant to
         which the Seller or any of its Affiliates is authorized or licensed to
         use any third party Intellectual Property or Technology that is used in
         connection with the Access Business as currently conducted, except for
         so-called "shrink-wrap" or "click-wrap" license agreements relating to

         business ("Inbound Licenses").

                  (e)      Except as set forth in Schedule 4.13(e)(i), to the
         Seller's knowledge, the conduct of the Access Business as currently

         or Technology that is Intellectual Property of any other Person that
         would result in any material liability or have any Business Material
         Adverse Effect on the continued conduct of the Access Business as
         conducted on the Closing Date. Except as set forth in Schedule
         4.13(e)(i), (i) no claims are pending or, to the Seller's knowledge,
         threatened, against the Seller or any of its Affiliates by any Person
         with respect to the ownership, validity (excluding administrative
         actions received in the normal course of business in connection with
         pending patent applications), enforceability or use in the Access
         Business of any Intellectual Property and (ii) during the past three
         (3) years the Seller and its Affiliates

                                      -41-

         neither the Parent, the Seller or Marconi IP has received any written
         or, to the Seller's knowledge, oral, communication from any Person
         asserting any ownership interest in, or requesting that the Seller
         obtain a license to, any Transferred Patents, Transferred Trademarks or
         Transferred Technology. Schedule 4.13(e)(ii) contains a complete and

         Transferred Trademarks, a description of the subject matter of each
         proceeding, and the current status of each proceeding, including
         interferences, priority contests, opposition and protests. Except as
         set forth in Schedule 4.13(e)(iii), to the Seller's knowledge, no third
         party is infringing, misappropriating or violating any of the
         Transferred Patents, Transferred Trademarks or Transferred Technology.

                  (f)      The Parent, the Seller or Marconi IP have used all
         reasonable efforts to maintain all material Transferred Technology that
         constitutes confidential or trade secret information in confidence in
         accordance with protection procedures customarily used in the industry
         to protect rights of like importance. As to any claim against the
         Seller, Marconi IP or any of their Affiliates asserting that Personnel
         owns the Transferred Patents or Transferred Technology, no such claim
         has been asserted or, to Seller's knowledge, is threatened. To the
         Seller's knowledge, none of the current officers and employees of
         Marconi IP, the Seller or their Affiliates has any patents issued or
         applications pending for any device, process, design or invention of
         any kind that was conceived or developed within the scope of such
         officers' or employees' employment by Marconi IP, the Seller or the
         applicable Affiliate in the furtherance of the Access Business, which
         patents or applications have not been assigned to Marconi IP, the
         Seller or such Affiliates, with such assignment duly recorded in the
         United States Patent and Trademark Office.

         Agreement by the Seller, the Parent and Marconi IP, (ii) the execution
         and delivery of the Cross License Agreement by the Marconi Entities nor
         (iii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
         thereby by the Seller, the Parent, Marconi IP or the other Marconi
         Entities, as applicable, will result in (A) a loss of, or encumbrance
         or lien on, any Transferred Patents, Transferred Trademarks or
         Transferred Technology, (B) the grant, assignment, or transfer to any
         other person or entity of any license or other right or interest under,
         to, or in any of the Transferred Patents, Transferred Trademarks or
         Transferred Technology, or (C) the Purchaser being obligated to pay any
         royalties or other amounts to any third party in excess of those
         payable by the Seller or Marconi IP prior to the Closing, other than
         payments calculated based on product sales.

Permits required by applicable Law for them to own or hold the Assets and

validly held by the Seller and Marconi IP, as applicable, and each of the Seller
and Marconi IP has complied in all material respects with all terms and
conditions thereof. Since January 1, 2002, neither the Seller nor any of its
Affiliates has received any written notice of any Proceedings relating to the
revocation or modification of any such Permits the loss of which, individually
or in the aggregate, constitutes a Business Material Adverse Effect or a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.15, none of such

liability, workers' compensation and other forms of insurance (and/or
participates in insurance arrangements made by one or more of its Affiliates)
with respect to the Access Business in such amounts, with such deductibles and
against such risks and losses as are reasonable for the Access Business (it
being understood that the Seller is self-insured with respect to workers'
compensation claims that may be brought by Former Access Employees whose primary
place of employment at the time such employees worked for the Access Business
was in Ohio). Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16, all such policies are in
full force and effect, all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid
(other than retroactive or retrospective premium adjustments that are not yet,
but may be, required to be paid with respect to any period ending prior to the
Closing Date under comprehensive general liability and worker's compensation
insurance policies), and no notice of cancellation or termination has been
received by the Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to any such policy
which has not been replaced on substantially similar terms prior to the date of
such cancellation. To the Seller's knowledge, the Access Business has been
conducted in a manner so as to conform in all material respects to all

being agreed that nothing in this parenthetical shall be deemed to limit or
modify the covenants of the Parent, the Seller or Marconi IP herein other than
the covenant contained in this clause (y)) not to be true and correct as of the
date of such action or as of the Closing Date.

                  (a)      Negative Covenants. Without limiting the generality
         of the foregoing, except as set forth in the corresponding subsections
         of Schedule 6.2 or as expressly permitted or required by this
         Agreement, prior to the Closing, neither the Seller nor Marconi IP (in
         each case, solely in relation to the Access Business) shall without the
         prior written consent of the Purchaser:

                  (b)      Advise of Changes.

                           (i)      From the date hereof until the Closing,
         promptly after the Seller acquires knowledge of any such matter, the
         Seller shall advise the Purchaser in writing of (A) any material
         failure of the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent to comply with or
         satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
         satisfied by it hereunder and (B) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of
         any event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be
         likely to cause any condition to the obligations of the Purchaser to
         effect the Closing hereunder not to be satisfied or that calls into
         question the ability of the Seller, the Purchaser or Marconi IP to
         enter into or enforce any of the Related Agreements.

                           (ii)     From the date hereof until the Closing,
         promptly after the Purchaser acquires knowledge of any such matter, the
         Purchaser shall advise the Seller in writing of (A) any material
         failure of the Purchaser or AFCNA to comply with or satisfy any
         covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
         hereunder and (B) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event, the
         occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be likely to
         cause any condition to the obligations of the Seller to effect the
         Closing hereunder not to be satisfied or that calls into question the
         ability of the Purchaser or AFCNA to enter into or enforce any of the
         Related Agreements.

                  (c)      Affirmative Covenants. Until the Closing, the Parent,
         the Seller and, to the extent applicable, Marconi IP, shall:

                           (i)      use reasonable best efforts to maintain the
         Assets in all material respects in good working order, in accordance
         with the past practice of the Access Business;

                           (ii)     upon acquiring knowledge of any damage
         (other than immaterial damage), destruction or loss to, or condemnation
         of, any material Asset, (A) promptly notify the Purchaser, (B) make all
         available claims against insurance policies covering such Asset (the
         "Pre-Closing Insurance Claims") and (C) consult with the Purchaser as
         to the application of any and all insurance proceeds with respect
         thereto to repair, replace or restore such Asset;

                           (iii)    use reasonable best efforts to maintain its
         level and quality of Accounts Receivable and Inventory and spare parts
         in the ordinary course of business so as to be sufficient for the
         conduct of the Access Business by the Purchaser following Closing in
         substantially the same manner as conducted on September 30, 2003 and as
         currently conducted by the Seller; and

                           (iv)     segregate any proceeds received prior to the
         Closing from any Claims (the "Claims Proceeds") into a separate account
         and retain any such Claims Proceeds in such account until the Closing;
         provided, however, that (A) any Claims Proceeds received under an
         insurance policy as a result of damage to or destruction of an Asset
         (other than Inventory) may, subject to Section 6.2(c)(ii), be used to
         replace the damaged or destroyed Asset and (B) any Claims Proceeds
         received under an insurance

                                      -56-
<PAGE>

         policy as a result of damage to or destruction of Inventory need not be
         segregated into a separate account and may be used or disbursed in the
         Seller's sole discretion.

                  (d)      Consultation. Except to the extent that any such
         consultation would be in violation of applicable Laws, in connection
         with the continuing operation of the Access Business between the date
         of this Agreement and the Closing, to the extent reasonably requested
         by Purchaser, the Seller shall consult in good faith on a regular and
         frequent basis with representatives of the Purchaser to report material
         operational developments and the general status of ongoing operations.
         Any such consultation shall not constitute a waiver by the Purchaser of
         any rights under this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall not have any
         liability or responsibility for any actions of the Parent, the Seller
         or Marconi IP or any of their respective officers or directors with
         respect to matters that are the subject of such consultations.

         6.3      Consents and Approvals.

                  (a)      On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
         Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
         the Closing to occur, including taking all reasonable actions necessary
         (i) to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
         on it or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Closing and (ii) to
         obtain each Governmental Required Consent and each other Consent of or
         with a Governmental Authority which if not obtained or made would
         reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability
         of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For
         purposes of this Section 6.3(a), the "reasonable best efforts" of the
         Purchaser shall include (1) opposing any motion or action for a
         temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against or other
         prohibition of the Closing and (2) entering into a consent decree,
         other order or other agreement, or giving an assurance, commitment or
         undertaking, containing the Purchaser's agreement to hold separate and
         divest (pursuant to any terms as may be required by any Governmental
         Authority) the business, products and assets of any product or service
         lines of the Access Business and/or any other business, product line,
         service line, division or subsidiary of the Purchaser and/or any
         Affiliate of the Purchaser and otherwise to take such other action as
         may be required by any Governmental Authority; provided, however, that
         neither the foregoing nor anything else in this Agreement shall require
         the Purchaser to take any action or agree to take or not to take any
         action if the taking of any such action or the agreement to take or not
         to take any such action would reasonably be expected to have a material
         adverse effect on the benefits (viewed as a whole) reasonably expected
         to be derived by the Purchaser from the Acquisition, including any
         action that would (x) involve a change in or restriction on the
         business, products, assets or operations of the Access Business, the
         Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser or (y) involve the
         disposition (whether by way of sale, lease, license or otherwise),
         before or after the Closing, of all or any portion of the business,
         products or assets (including Intellectual Property) of the Access
         Business, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser.

                  (b)      In furtherance and not in limitation of the
         provisions of Section 6.3(a), each of the Seller, Marconi IP, the
         Parent, the Purchaser and AFCNA shall cooperate with the other with
         respect to obtaining and making the Consents of Governmental

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

         Authorities in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
         contemplated hereby. The Seller, Parent, Marconi IP, the Purchaser and
         AFCNA, or Persons nominated thereby, will promptly provide drafts to
         the others, allow reasonably adequate time for comment by the others
         and consult with the others as promptly as practicable with respect to
         the contents of all notifications, filings, submissions, further
         documentation and evidence to be submitted to all relevant Governmental
         Authorities. The Seller, Marconi IP, the Parent, the Purchaser and
         AFCNA shall, in each case where permitted by the relevant Governmental
         Authority, allow Persons nominated by the other party to attend all
         meetings with Governmental Authorities and, where appropriate, to make
         oral submissions at such meetings. Each of the Purchaser, Marconi IP,
         the Parent, the Seller and AFCNA shall (i) furnish to the other such
         necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
         require in connection with its preparation of any notification, filing,
         submission or further documentation or evidence that is necessary in
         obtaining and making Consents of Governmental Authorities and (ii)
         promptly disclose to the other all correspondence received from or sent
         to any relevant Governmental Authority in connection herewith and shall
         keep the other fully informed of any other related communication in
         whatever form with any of the relevant Governmental Authorities. The
         Purchaser, the Parent, Marconi IP, the Seller and AFCNA shall comply
         promptly with any inquiry or request for additional information from
         any relevant Governmental Authority in connection herewith and shall
         promptly provide any supplemental information requested in connection
         with the notifications, filings and/or submissions made hereunder for
         the purposes of obtaining and making the Consents of Governmental
         Authorities.

                  (c)      Each party shall promptly notify the other parties in
         writing of any notice or other communication from any third party
         received by it alleging that the consent of such third party is or may
         be required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
         of this Agreement or any Related Agreement or the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Seller shall, and
         shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to
         obtain, and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
         cooperate with the Seller and its Affiliates in obtaining, all Consents
         from third parties required in connection with the execution, delivery
         or performance of this Agreement or any Related Agreement or the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;
         provided, however, that, subject to the exceptions set forth on
         Schedule 6.3(c) (incorporated herein), the parties shall not be
         required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation
         in favor of) any Person from whom any such Consent may be required
         (other than nominal filing or application fees). The Purchaser and
         AFCNA acknowledge that certain Consents with respect to the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from
         parties to Contracts and that such Consents have not been obtained.
         Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, and without limiting
         the representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller, the Parent
         and Marconi IP herein, including in this Section 6.3 and in Sections
         4.3, 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15, so long as the Seller and its Affiliates
         have complied with their obligations under this Agreement and the
         Related Agreements in any way related to obtaining Consents and there
         has been no breach of any applicable representation or warranty by the
         Seller, the Parent or Marconi IP hereunder or under the applicable
         Related Agreement in any way implicated by the failure to obtain a
         Consent,

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

         the Seller, the Parent and Marconi IP shall not have any Liability to
         the Purchaser and AFCNA to the extent due to the failure to obtain any
         Consents that may be required in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement or because of the termination of any
         Purchased Contract as a result thereof.

                  (d)      Without limiting the terms of this Section 6.3, each
         of the Purchaser and the Seller will (i) as soon as reasonably
         practicable after the date of this Agreement file with the Antitrust
         Division and the FTC the notification and report form, if required by
         the HSR Act, for the transactions contemplated hereunder, requesting
         early termination of the waiting period thereunder, (ii) respond
         promptly to inquiries from the Antitrust Division or the FTC in
         connection with such filings, including providing any supplemental
         information that may be requested by the Antitrust Division or the FTC,
         and (iii) provide to the other party copies of any filings made under
         the HSR Act at the time they are filed with the Antitrust Division or
         the FTC.

         6.4      Marconi Name.

                  (a)      The Purchaser and AFCNA acknowledge that the Marconi
         Name is and shall remain the property of the Seller or its Affiliates
         and that nothing in this Agreement shall transfer or shall operate as
         an agreement to transfer any right, title or interest in the Marconi
         Name to the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser.

                  (b)      Subject to Sections 6.4(c), (d) and (e), the Seller
         is not granting the Purchaser or AFCNA a license to use, and neither
         the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have any title, right or
         interest in or to, the Marconi Name after the Closing.

                  (c)      The Purchaser and AFCNA agree:

         deleted, pasted over or placed a sticker over such references;

                           (ii)     as soon as reasonably practicable after the
         Closing, and in any event no later than one hundred twenty (120) days

         packaging that remain in the Purchaser's possession, custody or control
         and that contain a reference to the Marconi Name, that the Purchaser
         and AFCNA shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as

                           (iv)     that the Purchaser and AFCNA shall use their
         respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that, from and following
         the Closing, no stocks, goods, products, services or software are
         manufactured, produced or provided showing, having marked thereon or
         using the Marconi Name.

                  (d)      For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser and AFCNA
         shall have no obligation to remove the Marconi Name from any products
         (or related packaging, documentation or other materials) sold,
         licensed, leased, delivered or otherwise provided by the Access
         Business to a third party prior to the Closing.

                  (e)      The Purchaser and AFCNA shall have the right to

         6.6      Assignments. The Seller and Marconi IP, as applicable, shall

<PAGE>

         normal business hours, to such information relating to the Access
         Business (to the extent within the control of such party or any of its
         Affiliates) as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and/or
         accounting matters (including (i) responding to inquires or other
         demands of any Governmental Authority (including the Securities and
         Exchange Commission) and (ii) in the case of the Purchaser, confirming
         the information contained in the Audit to be delivered by the Seller to
         the Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.17). Notwithstanding the previous
         sentence, if any particular item of the Seller, Marconi IP or the
         Parent that the Purchaser or AFCNA has the right of access to pursuant
         to this Section 6.7(b) contains both information related to the Access
         Business and other information that is not reasonably necessary for
         financial reporting and/or accounting matters, then the Seller, Marconi
         IP or the Parent, as applicable, can, at its option, either (i) provide
         a copy of such information to the Purchaser or AFCNA subject to the
         Purchaser's and AFCNA's obligations contained herein to keep such other
         information confidential or (ii) create a new form of such information
         and provide the Purchaser and AFCNA with access to such new form of
         information.

                  (c)      From and after the Closing, the Purchaser and AFCNA
         shall preserve and retain all Information and Records and other
         accounting, legal, auditing and other books and records (including any
         documents relating to any governmental or non-governmental claims,
         actions, suits, proceedings or investigations with respect to the
         Seller) relating to the conduct of the Access Business and the
         ownership of the Assets on or prior to the Closing Date in a manner
         consistent with the Purchaser's document retention policy.

                  (d)      In the event and for so long as any party hereto is
         contesting or defending against or prosecuting any third-party charge,
         complaint, action, suit, Proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim or
         demand in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this
         Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
         activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure
         to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the
         Access Business, each other party hereto will (A) fully cooperate with
         it and its counsel in, and assist it and its counsel with, the contest,
         defense or prosecution, (B) make available its personnel (including for
         purposes of fact finding, consultation, interviews, depositions and, if
         required, as witnesses), and (C) provide such information, testimony
         and access to its books and records, in each case as shall be
         reasonably requested in connection with the contest, defense or
         prosecution, all at the sole cost and expense (not including employee
         compensation and benefits costs) of the contesting, defending or
         prosecuting party (unless the contesting, defending or prosecuting
         party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article XII). For
         the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.7(d) shall not apply with
         respect to disputes between the parties hereto.

                  (e)      Each party shall reimburse the other parties for
         reasonable out-of-pocket administrative costs and expenses incurred at
         the request of the other in assisting the other pursuant to this
         Section 6.7. No party shall be required by this Section 6.7 to take any
         action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its
         business or unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case
         of Purchaser, the Access Business). Any information received by any
         party pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be subject to Section 6.9.

                                      -61-

         6.8      Insurance. The Purchaser and AFCNA acknowledge that (a) all of
the insurance policies maintained by the Seller or any of its Affiliates prior
to the Closing Date will be terminated with respect to the Access Business
effective as of the Closing Date and (b) upon such termination, the Access
Business will cease to be covered under such policies and the Purchaser and
AFCNA will have to obtain replacement coverage (including coverage as the
Purchaser deems appropriate for the Assets, the operation of the Access Business
and the satisfaction of the Assumed Obligations). To the extent the Seller or
any of its Affiliates receive any proceeds from any Pre-Closing Insurance Claims
following the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause the relevant Affiliate
to, promptly remit such insurance claim proceeds to the Purchaser.

         6.9      Confidentiality.

                  (a)      Pre-Closing Confidentiality Terms and Other
         Confidentiality Agreements. The parties have previously entered into
         several confidentiality agreements covering specific purposes
         (collectively, the "Other Confidentiality Agreements"), and a
         confidentiality agreement dated December 12, 2002 (as amended, the
         "December CA") specifically addressing the purchase transaction
         contemplated by this Agreement. The parties intend that all rights,
         obligations and causes of action that existed or arose under the Other
         Confidentiality Agreements and the December CA, respectively, prior to
         the effective date of this Agreement, shall continue to be governed by
         and subject to the terms of the Other Confidentiality Agreements and
         the December CA, respectively, and nothing in this Agreement shall be
         deemed to be a waiver of any rights or a release of any party with
         respect to those rights, obligations and causes of action. From and
         after the effective date of this Agreement, and except with respect to
         the December CA, the parties intend that their obligations, rights and
         causes of action arising under the Other Confidentiality Agreements
         shall continue to be governed by and subject to the terms of the Other
         Confidentiality Agreements, respectively, and nothing in this Agreement
         shall be deemed to be a waiver of any rights or a release of any party
         with respect to those rights, obligations and causes of action. It is
         the intent of the parties that the Other Confidentiality Agreements
         shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the subject
         matter and purposes for which they were entered into, and this
         Agreement shall not modify, affect or otherwise impact the Other
         Confidentiality Agreements. With respect to the December CA, (i) prior
         to the effective date of this Agreement, the December CA shall govern
         the information provided by a disclosing party to the others in
         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Related
         Agreements, and (ii) from and after the effective date of this
         Agreement, this Section 6.9 shall govern the information provided by a
         disclosing party to the others in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, and for all rights, obligations and
         causes of action arising from and after the effective date of this
         Agreement, the December CA is hereby superceded by this Agreement.

                  (b)      Permitted Disclosures. Each of the following reasons
         shall be deemed to be a "Permitted Disclosure" and collectively, the
         "Permitted Disclosures", subject to the terms and conditions applicable
         to any such Permitted Disclosure as set forth below or as otherwise
         expressly set forth in this Section 6.9:

         parties the opportunity to appear and object, if it so chooses and (C)

         parties making a motion for such, to which the receiving parties shall
         make no objection;

         required by the rules of any stock exchange, the Panel on Takeovers and
         Mergers, the UKLA or any other Law or Judgment (in which case the party
         required to make the disclosure shall promptly notify the other parties
         and give such parties a reasonable opportunity to oppose such
         disclosure or request confidential treatment of such disclosure if
         available);

                           (vii)    subject to reasonable assurances of
         confidentiality, disclosing this Agreement or any of the Related
         Agreements or their contents or the transactions contemplated hereby or

         agreement protecting the confidentiality of such information, to
         current or potential lenders to, investors in and purchasers of the
         parties or their Affiliates (or any portion thereof) so long as (1) the
         due diligence investigation by the lender, investor or purchaser, as
         applicable, of such party and its Affiliates is substantially complete,
         (2) the definitive agreement with respect to such loan, investment or
         purchase, as applicable, is substantially complete and substantially

         Assumed Obligations shall be deemed the confidential information of the
         Purchaser, and the Purchaser's obligations from and after the Closing
         under this Section 6.9, the December CA and the Other Confidentiality
         Agreements with respect to such information shall cease.

                  (g)      Return or Destruction of Access Business Information.
         Promptly following the date hereof, each of the Seller, Marconi IP and
         the Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to secure the return or
         destruction of all information and materials

                                      -65-

         relating to the Access Business, the Assets and the Assumed Obligations
         provided to any Person who is or was a potential purchaser of the
         Access Business. To the extent any Person returns such information and
         materials to the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent, the Seller shall
         destroy all such information and materials. To the extent possible, the
         Seller shall provide the Purchaser with all information reasonably
         requested by the Purchaser regarding the status of such process.

                  (h)      Return or Destruction of Seller Information. The
         Purchaser and AFCNA agree that upon written notice from the Seller,
         Marconi IP or the Parent, the Purchaser and AFCNA shall promptly (and
         in any case within 14 days of the request) return to the Seller,
         Marconi IP or the Parent, as the case may be, all confidential
         information of the Seller, Marconi IP and the Parent provided by them
         in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
         the Purchaser, AFCNA, any of their Affiliates or their Representatives,
         except Notes (as defined in the December CA), and cause all Notes (and
         copies thereof) to be destroyed, and certify in writing to the Seller,
         Marconi IP and the Parent that all such material has been returned or
         destroyed in compliance with this Agreement; provided, however, that
         this obligation shall not apply from and after the Closing Date to any
         Information and Records, Transferred Technology or information arising
         from the Assumed Obligations.

                  (i)      Retention of Information. Upon and after the Closing
         Date, each of the Seller, Marconi IP, the Parent and their respective
         Affiliates shall retain only such copies of the Transferred Technology
         as are maintained as of the date of this Agreement by each of the
         Seller, Marconi IP, the Parent or their respective Affiliates in the
         conduct of their respective businesses other than the Access Business
         in the ordinary course of business. In addition, upon and after the
         Closing Date, each of the Seller, Marconi IP and the Parent and their
         respective Affiliates shall retain only such copies of confidential
         information of the Purchaser and AFCNA as may be necessary to perform
         their respective obligations under the Related Agreements, in each case
         in accordance with the terms and conditions provided in such
         agreements. Finally, the Seller, Marconi IP and the Parent shall be
         entitled to retain one copy of such information as they deem necessary
         for archive purposes for a record of the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement and the Related Agreements.

                  (j)      No Representations or Warranties; No Licenses. Except
         as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any of the Related
         Agreements, neither the Purchaser nor AFCNA nor any of their
         Affiliates, on the one hand, nor the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent
         or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, makes any
         representations or warranties with respect to any of the information
         provided by them in connection with the transactions contemplated
         hereby or by the Related Agreements. In addition, except as expressly
         set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreements, neither the
         Purchaser nor AFCNA or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, nor
         the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent or any of their Affiliates, on the
         other hand, grants any licenses or rights in any information provided
         by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
         or by the Related Agreements.

                  (k)      Privilege Savings Clause. Each party providing any
         information in connection with this Agreement is not waiving, and will
         not be deemed to have waived or diminished, any of its attorney work
         product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections
         and privileges as a result of disclosing such information (including
         information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the other
         party, regardless of whether such disclosing party has asserted, or is
         or may be entitled to assert, such privileges and protections. The
         parties (i) share a common legal and commercial interest in all of such
         information that is subject to such privileges and protections; (ii)
         may become joint defendants in Proceedings to which such information
         covered by such protections and privileges relates; (iii) intend that
         such privileges and protections remain intact should any party become
         subject to any actual or threatened Proceeding to which such
         information covered by such protections and privileges relates; and
         (iv) intend that after the Closing the receiving party shall have the
         right to assert such protections and privileges. No receiving party
         shall admit, claim or contend, in Proceedings involving either party or
         otherwise, that any party disclosing such information waived any of its
         attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or
         similar protections and privileges with respect to any information,
         documents or other material disclosed to a party due to a disclosing
         party disclosing information (including information related to pending
         or threatened litigation) to such receiving party.

                  (l)      Additional Mutual Obligations. On and after the
         effective date of this Agreement, except for the Permitted Disclosures,
         each of the Seller, Marconi IP and the Parent, and their respective
         Affiliates, and the Purchaser and AFCNA and their respective
         Affiliates, agree to hold confidential the terms and provisions of this
         Agreement and the Related Agreements and the terms of the transactions
         contemplated hereby and thereby.

         6.10     Taxes.

                  (a)      Property Taxes. All real estate, personal property,
         and ad valorem Taxes relating to the Assets which shall have accrued
         and become payable prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by the
         Seller. All such Taxes which shall be accrued but unpaid shall be
         prorated to the Closing Date. In connection with such proration, in the
         event the actual Tax figures are not available at the Closing Date,
         proration of Taxes shall be based on 105% of the actual Taxes for the
         preceding year for which actual Tax figures are available. The amount
         due one party as a result of such proration shall be paid to the other
         party at the Closing.

                  (b)      Taxes Related to Transaction. The Seller and the
         Purchaser shall each pay one-half of the cost of all property transfer,
         sales, use or Transfer Taxes, and all recording costs, arising out of
         the transfer of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement and all costs and
         expenses incurred in connection with the transferring and recording of
         title to the Assets. The sales, use and transfer Tax Returns required
         by reason of said transfer shall be timely prepared and filed by the
         party legally obligated to make such filing. The parties agree to
         cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation and filing
         of such Tax Returns, in obtaining all available exemptions from such
         sales, use and transfer Taxes and in timely providing each other with
         resale certificates and any other documents necessary to satisfy any
         such exemptions.

                  (c)      Access to Tax Records. After the Closing, upon
         reasonable written notice, the Purchaser, AFCNA, the Seller, the Parent
         and Marconi IP shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and
         their respective Representatives, as promptly as practicable, such
         information and assistance (to the extent within the control of such
         party) relating to the Assets (including access to books and records)
         as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns (including
         Form 8594), and making of any election related to Taxes, the
         preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution
         or defense of any claim, suit or Proceeding related to any Tax Return.
         The Parent, Marconi IP, the Seller, the Purchaser and AFCNA shall
         cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other
         Proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Access Business. In the
         event that the Seller or any of its Affiliates or the Purchaser or any
         of its Affiliates shall after the Closing take any position in any Tax
         Return, or reach any settlement or agreement on audit, which is in any
         manner inconsistent with any position taken by the Seller or its
         Affiliates in any filing, settlement or agreement made by the Seller or
         its Affiliates prior to the Closing and such inconsistent position (i)
         might require the payment by the Purchaser or the Seller (or one of
         their respective Affiliates) of more Tax than would have been required
         to be paid had such position not been taken or such settlement or
         agreement not been reached, (ii) affects the determination of useful
         life, basis or method of depreciation, amortization or accounting of
         any of the Assets or any of the properties, assets or rights of the
         Purchaser or one of its Affiliates or (iii) might accelerate the time
         at which any Tax must be paid by the Purchaser or the Seller, then the
         Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, shall provide timely and
         reasonable notice to the other party hereto of such position.

         6.11     Agreement Not to Compete.

                  (a)      The Parent, the Seller and Marconi IP understand that
         the Purchaser and AFCNA would not have entered into this Agreement
         absent the provisions of this Section 6.11 and, therefore, for a period
         of five (5) years from the Closing Date, none of the Parent, the Seller
         nor Marconi IP shall, and each shall cause each of its Affiliates to
         not, directly or indirectly (including by owning any interest in,
         managing, operating or controlling any other business enterprise):

                           (i)      sell, provide, deliver or supply any
         Restricted Product to any BellSouth Entity for use, delivery or
         deployment within the Nine-State Region, or call on, solicit or attempt
         to induce any BellSouth Entity to order or purchase any Restricted
         Product for use, delivery or deployment within the Nine-State Region;
         or

                           (ii)     solicit, recruit or hire any person who is
         employed in the Access Business as operated by the Purchaser and its
         Affiliates after the Closing, provided, however, that this clause (ii)
         shall not prohibit hiring any person (A) who responds to a public
         advertisement which is disseminated generally and is not targeted at
         such person or at other employees of the Access Business, and who
         otherwise has not been solicited or recruited in violation of this
         clause (ii), or (B) who is first approached, solicited or recruited
         when no longer an employee of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
         and whose resignation or other termination of employment with the
         Purchaser or any of its Affiliates

                                      -68-

         was not solicited or induced, directly or indirectly, by the Parent,
         the Seller, Marconi IP or any of their Affiliates.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the terms of Section 6.11(a), (i)
         nothing in Section 6.11(a) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
         Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP or any of their Affiliates from carrying
         on or engaging in the Other Businesses (it being understood and agreed
         that the Seller and its Affiliates in conducting the Other Businesses
         (A) currently sell, provide, develop, deliver and supply Other Business
         Products and Other Business Services to, and may continue to sell,
         provide, develop, deliver and supply Other Business Products and Other
         Business Services to, Persons unaffiliated with the Parent, the Seller,
         Marconi IP and their other Affiliates that, in turn, package or combine
         such Other Business Products with, or use such Other Business Services
         in support of, Restricted Products that are or will be sold to a
         BellSouth Entity, (B) currently sell, provide, develop, deliver and
         supply Other Business Products and Other Business Services to, and may
         continue to sell, provide, develop, deliver and supply Other Business
         Products and Other Business Services to, a BellSouth Entity that are or
         will be used in connection with Restricted Products) and (C) may (1)
         obtain from any Person other than the Parent or any of its Affiliates
         Restricted Products (or components thereof) that do not incorporate or
         use any Core Technology and (2) incorporate or combine Other Business
         Products or Other Business Services into or with such Restricted
         Product, and then sell the resulting product(s) to a BellSouth Entity),
         (ii) in the event that any Person directly or indirectly acquires a
         majority equity interest in the Parent or any of its Affiliates
         (including the Seller) (each an "Acquired Entity"), then Section
         6.11(a) shall apply only to each Acquired Entity and not to the
         acquiring Person or any of such Person's Affiliates other than any
         Acquired Entity (provided that, if the applicable Acquired Entity
         elects upon written notice provided to the Purchaser on or before the
         closing of such acquisition to terminate the licenses granted to it
         under the Cross License Agreement effective as of the closing of such
         acquisition pursuant to Section 4.1.4 of the Cross License Agreement,
         then Section 6.11(a) shall apply to neither such Acquired Entity, the
         acquiring Person nor any of such Person's other Affiliates unless the
         acquiring Person or such Affiliate of the acquiring Person is otherwise
         licensed under the Cross License Agreement) and (iii) in the event that
         any Person acquires all or a portion of the business or assets of the
         Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Seller), regardless of
         the form of such transaction (other than a transaction of the type
         described in the previous clause (ii)), then Section 6.11(a) shall
         apply to the acquiring Person or such Person's Affiliates to the extent
         and only to the extent of the products, materials and services of the
         acquired business or acquired assets (or Evolutions thereof) that after
         the closing of the acquisition continue to be subject to the licenses
         under the Cross License Agreement; provided that, in the case of each
         of clause (ii) and (iii), Section 6.11(a) shall apply to the acquiring
         Person if such Person is the Parent or an Affiliate of the Parent
         immediately prior to such acquisition.

                  (c)      Section 6.11(a) shall not be deemed to be breached
         solely as a result of the ownership by the Parent, the Seller, Marconi
         IP and their Affiliates (taken collectively) of less than an aggregate
         of 5% of any class of equity of a publicly traded Person which sells,
         provides, delivers or supplies Restricted Products.

                  (d)      If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants
         contained in this Section 6.11 (collectively, the "Restrictive
         Covenants"), a court holds that the duration, scope or area
         restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then
         existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area
         reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated
         duration, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed and
         directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the
         maximum period, scope and area permitted by Law. Upon advice of legal
         counsel, each of the Parent, the Seller and Marconi IP has determined
         and hereby acknowledges that the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable
         in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions.

                  (e)      If the Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP or any of their
         respective Affiliates breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any
         of the Restrictive Covenants, then the Purchaser shall have the rights
         and remedies with respect to such breach as are set forth in Article
         XII (and for such purpose, Losses shall include Competition Damages)
         and Section 13.20 hereof. For purposes of this clause (e), "Competition
         Damages" shall mean the right and remedy to require the Seller and the
         Parent, jointly and severally, to account for and pay over to the
         Purchaser any profits or other benefits derived or received by the
         Person breaching such Restrictive Covenant as the result of any
         transactions constituting such a breach.

         6.12     Collection of Receivables. From and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall have the right and authority to collect for its own account (at
its own cost and risk) all Accounts Receivable that are included in the Assets
and to endorse with the name of the Seller any checks or drafts received with
respect to any Accounts Receivable (noting that such endorsement is explicitly
without recourse). The Seller shall promptly deliver to the Purchaser any cash
or other property received directly or indirectly by it or any of its Affiliates
with respect to the Accounts Receivable, including any amounts received as
interest on such Accounts Receivable.

         6.13     Release of Liens. Each of the Seller, Marconi IP and the
Parent shall (a) take all actions required of the Seller, Marconi IP or the
Parent (and shall cause their Affiliates to take all actions required of such
Affiliate) under the Indentures and the applicable security agreements related
thereto to cause the Liens encumbering the Assets under the Indentures and the
applicable security agreements related thereto to be terminated and released at
the Closing and (b) take all actions required of the Seller, Marconi IP or the
Parent (and shall cause their Affiliates to take all actions required of such
Affiliate) to cause any other Liens encumbering the Assets (other than Permitted
Liens) to be terminated and released at the Closing. Each of the Seller, Marconi
IP and the Parent shall use (and shall cause their Affiliates use) its
respective reasonable best efforts to cause all other actions necessary for such
Liens to be terminated and released at the Closing to be taken at or prior to
the Closing. Within one Business Day after the Closing Date, the Seller, Marconi
IP and the Parent, as applicable, shall make all filings (including UCC-3s), or
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the holders of the Liens encumbering
the Assets to make such filings, in all local, state and foreign jurisdictions
necessary to publicly notice the termination and release of such Liens. All such
releases and filings shall be in the form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Purchaser.

         6.14     Nonsolicitation. Neither the Parent, the Seller nor Marconi IP
shall, nor shall any of them authorize or permit any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives to, directly or

                                      -70-
<PAGE>

indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) any "other bid," (b) take any other action to knowingly facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably
be expected to lead to any "other bid," (c) engage in any discussion or
negotiations relating thereto (other than discussions solely related to
informing a third party of the existence of this provision) or (d) accept any
"other bid." The Parent, Marconi IP and the Seller shall instruct each of its
Representatives to observe the terms of this Section 6.14. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the first two sentences of this Section 6.14 by any Representative, whether or
not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Parent, Marconi IP or the
Seller or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.14 by the
Parent, Marconi IP and the Seller. Subject to contractual confidentiality
restrictions in place as of the date of this Agreement, the Parent or the Seller
promptly shall advise the Purchaser orally and in writing of any "other bid"
made after the execution of this Agreement or any inquiry made after the
execution of this Agreement which could reasonably be expected to lead to any
"other bid" and the identity of the Person making any such "other bid" or
inquiry. As used in this Section 6.14, "other bid" shall mean any proposal or
offer from any Person to directly or indirectly acquire in any manner any
substantial portion of the assets of the Access Business.

         6.15     Bedford Facility.

                  (a)      If the CAMI Transaction closes prior to the Closing,
         then at the Closing the Seller shall transfer the Bedford Lease to the
         Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall assume the Seller's rights and
         obligations thereunder.

                  (b)      If (i) the CAMI Transaction does not close prior to
         the Closing and (ii) at the time of the Closing the Bedford Sale
         Agreement has not been terminated, then at the Closing the Seller shall
         transfer the Seller's right to occupy the Bedford Facility under the
         Jabil Rationalization Agreement to the Purchaser and the Purchaser
         shall assume the Seller's obligations with respect to such occupancy
         right set forth in Section 3.9(b), the fourth sentence of (c), (d) and
         (e) of the Jabil Rationalization Agreement; provided, however, that
         notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall have no obligations
         to any Person (including Jabil or the Seller) under such sections in
         excess of the aggregate monthly rent for the Bedford Facility under the
         CAMI Lease (the "Maximum Rent"). The Purchaser shall thereafter occupy
         the Bedford Facility under the Seller's occupancy rights under the
         Jabil Rationalization Agreement until the earlier of (A) the closing of
         the CAMI Transaction (at which point the Seller shall transfer the
         Bedford Lease to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall assume the
         Seller's rights and obligations thereunder) and (B) the termination of
         the Bedford Sale Agreement (in which case the terms of Section 6.15(c)
         shall apply).

                  (c)      If the Bedford Sale Agreement is terminated either
         before or after the Closing, then the Seller shall (or shall cause a
         third-party buyer to) purchase the Bedford Facility from Jabil as soon
         as reasonably practicable after such termination pursuant to the terms
         of the Jabil Rationalization Agreement and lease the Bedford Facility
         to the Purchaser (or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser)
         pursuant to a lease containing substantially the same terms as the
         Bedford Lease (the "Seller Bedford Lease"). If such purchase is not
         effected prior to the Closing, then at the Closing the Seller shall
         transfer

                                      -71-
<PAGE>

         the Seller's right to occupy the Bedford Facility under the Jabil
         Rationalization Agreement to the Purchaser (and the Purchaser shall
         assume the Seller's obligations with respect to such occupancy right
         set forth in Section 3.9(b), the fourth sentence of (c), (d) and (e) of
         the Jabil Rationalization Agreement up to the Maximum Rent) until such
         time as the Seller purchases (or causes a third-party to purchase) the
         Bedford Facility from Jabil and the Seller or the third-party purchaser
         leases the Bedford Facility to the Purchaser or a wholly-owned
         subsidiary of the Purchaser pursuant to the Seller Bedford Lease.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
         this Section 6.15 and subject to the immediately following sentence,
         the Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all repairs or
         maintenance of the Bedford Facility during the period, if any, that the
         Purchaser occupies the Bedford Facility under the Jabil Rationalization
         Agreement pursuant to Section 6.15(b) and (c) above. In the event the
         Purchaser occupies the Bedford Facility pursuant to Section 6.15(b) and
         (c) above under the Jabil Rationalization Agreement and then either
         enters into the CAMI Lease or the Seller Bedford Lease, the Purchaser
         shall promptly reimburse the Seller for all such repair and maintenance
         costs and expenses incurred by the Seller that the Purchaser would
         otherwise have been liable for under the CAMI Lease assuming the
         Purchaser had been a party to the CAMI Lease and leased the Bedford
         Facility pursuant to such lease during the period that the Purchaser
         occupied the Bedford Facility under the Jabil Rationalization
         Agreement. Furthermore, during the period, if any, that the Purchaser
         occupies the Bedford Facility under the Jabil Rationalization Agreement
         pursuant to Section 6.15(b) and (c) above, the Purchaser agrees to use
         reasonable best efforts to prevent waste to the Bedford Facility from
         occurring; provided, however, the Purchaser shall not have any
         affirmative obligation of inspection.

         6.16     Grande. Between the date hereof and the Closing, each of the
Seller and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to comply with
the provisions of Schedule 6.16 with respect to the System Purchase Agreement,
dated as of October 29, 2001, between Grande and the Seller, as amended by the
Letter Agreement, dated December 16, 2002, between Grande and the Seller
(collectively, the "System Purchase Agreement"), which such System Purchase
Agreement is a Shared Contract.

         6.17     Audit.

                  (a)      Without limiting the parties' other obligations under
         this Article VI, the Seller agrees to prepare "special purpose
         financial statements" of the Access Business, including a statement of
         Assets to be acquired by the Purchaser and Assumed Obligations as of
         September 30, 2003, and the related statements of operations and of
         cash flows for the year then ended (the "2003 Financial Statements"),
         including related footnotes, otherwise (except for the omission of
         assets not acquired and liabilities not assumed) in conformity with
         accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S.
         GAAP"), and agrees to engage the Seller's independent public
         accountants, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), to commence an audit
         of the 2003 Financial Statements under auditing standards generally
         accepted in the United States (the "Audit"). Promptly after execution
         of this Agreement, the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
         prepare the

                                      -72-
<PAGE>

         2003 Financial Statements on the basis provided in this paragraph (a)
         (or, if applicable, on such other basis as may be required pursuant to
         paragraph (b) below), and cause Deloitte to commence and complete the
         Audit of such financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable
         after the execution of the engagement letter. The Seller agrees to
         cause such engagement letter to be prepared, and the Seller will be
         prepared to execute such letter on its own behalf, promptly after the
         date hereof. The Seller and the Purchaser will both be signatories to
         Deloitte's engagement letter for the Audit. The Seller represents that
         subject to the "special purpose" nature of the financial statements,
         the 2003 Financial Statements will fairly present the financial
         condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Access Business
         as of and for the applicable period, and will be consistent with the
         books and records of the Seller.

                  (b)      The Seller will, and will use its reasonable best
         efforts to cause its independent public accountants to, cooperate with
         the Purchaser with respect to the preparation and presentation of a
         written request by the Purchaser pursuant to Rule 3-13 of Regulation
         S-X (the "Request") for appropriate relief from the staff of the
         Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange
         Commission (the "SEC's Staff") in order to permit the filing and use by
         the Purchaser of "special purpose financial statements" of the Access
         Business as contemplated in Section 6.17(a) to fulfill its obligations
         under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. The Seller (and to the extent
         required, the Parent and/or Marconi IP) will promptly prepare a letter
         addressed to the Purchaser that contains such information as may be
         reasonably required for purposes of the Request, including an
         explanation of the appropriateness of the "special purpose financial
         statement" basis contemplated by Section 6.17(a). The Seller will
         provide the Purchaser with any information reasonably required to
         respond to any comments or inquiries of the SEC's Staff received with
         respect to the Request. If the SEC's Staff denies the Request or
         otherwise indicates to the Purchaser that the 2003 Financial Statements
         must be prepared on a different basis than that stated in the Request,
         then the Purchaser will promptly notify the Seller of the basis on
         which the 2003 Financials must be prepared pursuant to such
         communication from the SEC's Staff, and the Seller will cause the 2003
         Financial Statements to be prepared under U.S. GAAP on the basis so
         notified by the Purchaser.

                  (c)      Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Parent
         shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate fully with
         Deloitte in connection with the Audit, including providing Deloitte
         with reasonable access to personnel, books and records as is requested
         by Deloitte to complete the Audit. Subsequent to the Closing, each of
         the Seller and the Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
         Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate fully with the
         Purchaser, Deloitte and any other auditors of the Purchaser in
         connection with the Audit and the financial statements that are the
         subject of the Audit, including (i) providing reasonable access to
         personnel, books and records (including reasonable access to personnel,
         books and records of the Other Businesses to the extent necessary) as
         may be requested by Deloitte to complete the Audit, (ii) cooperating
         with the reasonable requests of the Purchaser and its independent
         accountants in order to permit the Purchaser and its Affiliates to
         prepare and submit the Request and to respond to inquiries or other
         demands of any Governmental Entity (including the Securities Exchange
         Commission) related to such financial statements of the Access Business
         or to

                                      -73-
<PAGE>

         confirm the information upon which such financial statements are based
         (including for purposes of any "comfort letter" requested by the
         Purchaser), and (iii) facilitating discussions between the Purchaser
         and Deloitte with respect to the completed Audit to the extent
         reasonably requested by the Purchaser. The Seller and the Parent
         acknowledge and agree that the foregoing cooperation could involve the
         provision of information concerning non-Access Business units (such as
         the Other Businesses) to the extent relevant to the preparation and
         audit of such financial statements of the Access Business, provided,
         that, such information will be provided only to the auditors (and not
         to the Purchaser except to the extent reasonably necessary for the
         purposes set forth in clause (ii) above), subject to customary
         confidentiality restrictions. It is acknowledged and agreed that it is
         the intention of the parties to facilitate the completion of the Audit
         as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.

                  (d)      As soon as reasonably practicable after issuance of
         Deloitte's report on the Audit of the 2003 Financial Statements, the
         Seller shall provide a copy of the 2003 Financial Statements and an
         Audit report to the Purchaser. After the delivery of the 2003 Financial
         Statements and Audit report by the Seller to the Purchaser, the
         Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all fees and reasonably
         documented expenses billed by Deloitte (consistent with their
         engagement letter) and paid by the Seller in connection with the Audit,
         within five (5) Business Days of the presentation to the Purchaser of
         reasonably detailed documentation of such fees and expenses.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the Purchaser terminates this
         Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i), then the Seller shall be
         responsible for all fees and expenses of Deloitte in connection with
         the Audit and shall promptly reimburse the Purchaser for any and all
         fees and expenses paid by the Purchaser to Deloitte directly or to the
         Seller pursuant to the reimbursement provisions of the immediately
         preceding sentence and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated other than
         (A) by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i) or (B) by the
         Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i), then the Purchaser and the
         Seller shall share equally all fees and expenses of Deloitte in
         connection with the Audit and the Seller shall promptly reimburse the
         Purchaser for one-half of any and all fees and expenses paid by the
         Purchaser to Deloitte directly or to the Seller pursuant to the
         reimbursement provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.

                  (e)      Until the Audit report has been delivered to the
         Purchaser, the Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
         a weekly conference call with the Purchaser at a mutually agreeable
         time at which representatives of the Seller will inform the Purchaser
         of the timing and general status of the Audit. The Seller represents
         that such information will accurately summarize the timing and status
         of the Audit in all material respects.

                  (f)      To the extent required by the Purchaser under the
         Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules
         and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), with
         respect to each quarterly financial reporting period ending prior to
         the Closing Date, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December
         31, 2003, the Seller will prepare financial statements on a basis
         consistent with the 2003 Financial Statements per Section 6.17(a) as of
         and for the applicable quarterly period ended (the "Interim Financial
         Statements"). The Seller agrees to engage Deloitte to perform an audit
         of the Interim Financial Statements under auditing standards generally
         accepted in the

                                      -74-
<PAGE>

         United States (the "Interim Audit"). The Seller shall use its
         reasonable best efforts to prepare the Interim Financial Statements and
         cause Deloitte to commence and complete the Interim Audit as soon as
         reasonably practicable upon determination by the Purchaser that such
         financial statements are required by the Purchaser and to furnish to
         the Purchaser the Interim Financial Statements at least five (5) days
         prior to the date that the Purchaser is required to file its report
         with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Subject to the "special purpose"
         nature of the financial statements, the Seller represents such Interim
         Financial Statements will fairly present the financial condition,
         results of operations and cash flows of the Access Business as of and
         for the applicable period, and will be consistent with the books and
         records of the Seller, subject only to the absence of footnotes. The
         provisions of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 6.17 will
         apply to the parties' obligations replacing "the Audit" with "the
         Interim Audit" as applicable and replacing "the 2003 Financial
         Statements" with "the Interim Financial Statements" as applicable.

                  (b)      by the Seller or the Purchaser, if the Closing shall
         not have taken place on or before July 31, 2004 (the "Termination
         Date"); provided, that, the right to terminate this Agreement under
         this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to (i) the Seller if the
         failure of the Seller or any of its Affiliates to fulfill any of their
         obligations under this Agreement caused the failure of the Closing to
         occur on or before such date or (ii) the Purchaser if the failure of
         the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to fulfill any of their
         obligations under this Agreement caused the failure of the Closing to
         occur on or before such date;

                  (c)      by the Purchaser, (i) if there shall have been a
         breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller, Marconi IP or
         the Parent hereunder and the breach of such

                                      -80-

<PAGE>

         representation or warranty constitutes a Business Material Adverse
         Effect or a Seller Material Adverse Effect, or if there shall have been
         a material breach of any covenant or obligation of the Seller, Marconi
         IP or the Parent hereunder and, if such breach is curable, such breach
         shall not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt by
         the Seller of a notice in writing from the Purchaser specifying the
         breach and requesting such breach be remedied or (ii) if any of the
         other conditions set forth in Article VII shall have become incapable
         of fulfillment on or prior to the Termination Date and shall not have
         been waived by the Purchaser (unless the failure of such condition is
         the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser or
         AFCNA); or

                  (d)      by the Seller, (i) if there shall have been a

         specifying the breach and requesting such breach be remedied or (ii) if
         any of the other conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have become
         incapable of fulfillment on or prior to the Termination Date and shall
         not have been waived by the Seller (unless the failure of such
         condition is the result of a material breach of this Agreement by the
         Seller, the Parent or Marconi IP).

         In the event of termination by the Seller or the Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 10.1 (other than Section 10.1(a)), written notice thereof shall be
given to the other parties hereto.

         10.2     Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated

terminate, except for the obligations set forth in Sections 6.5 (Brokers), 6.9
(Confidentiality), 13.1 (Expenses) and 13.8 (Publicity), each of which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed,
however, that (a) no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for
any prior breach of this Agreement and (b) for purposes of determining such
liability, the terms of Article XII (other than Section 12.1 and Section 12.8)
shall survive the termination of this Agreement).

                                   ARTICLE XI

                         EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         11.1     Offers of Employment. The Purchaser shall offer each Current
Access Employee employment with the Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date.
The Purchaser's offers of employment shall be for employment on substantially
the same terms and conditions and at the same level of cash compensation as
applied to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date as employees of
the Seller and its Affiliates (excluding any amounts payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) except as otherwise
specifically provided by this Article XI with respect to employment terms and
conditions other than cash compensation, during their continued employment with
the Purchaser until such terms and conditions or cash compensation are changed
by the Purchaser in the ordinary course of business. Each such individual who
accepts the Purchaser's offer of employment shall become an employee of the
Purchaser as of the Closing and shall be referred to herein as a "Transferred
Employee".

         11.2     Employee Benefits - Generally. Subject to the provisions of
this Article XI, as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide or cause to
be provided to Transferred Employees employee benefits which are, in the
aggregate, substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated
employees of the Purchaser and its Affiliates. Each of the Parent and the Seller
agree that neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall assume
sponsorship or have any responsibility or Liability under any employee benefit
plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, and the Purchaser agrees that none of Parent, the Seller or any of
their Affiliates shall have any responsibility or Liability under any employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (collectively, the "Purchaser Benefit Plans"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Purchaser, the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall
have the obligations and responsibilities as otherwise specifically provided in
this Article XI.

         11.3     Service Credit. The Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser
Benefit Plan to provide to the Transferred Employees credit for their service
with the Seller and its Affiliates and their predecessors for all purposes under
the Purchaser Benefit Plans provided, that, the crediting of service with the
Seller, its Affiliates and their predecessors under the Purchaser Benefit Plans
will occur as set forth below:

                  (a)      Purchaser 401(k) Plan. For purposes of the Purchaser
         401(k) Plan, service shall be credited to each Transferred Employee for
         all purposes from the hire date used by the Marconi 401(k) Plan to
         determine service for the purposes of vesting and credit for a year of
         service will be provided for the calendar year in which such hire date
         occurred and each calendar year commencing after such hire date and
         before the Closing Date (provided that this provision shall not require
         double-counting of service otherwise credited under the Purchaser
         401(k) Plan).

                  (b)      Purchaser Sabbatical Plan. For purposes of the
         Purchaser's Sabbatical Plan, each Transferred Employee shall be given
         credit for two months of service for each year from the hire date used
         by the Marconi 401(k) Plan to determine service for purposes of
         vesting.

                  (c)      Purchase Stock Option Plans. No credit will be given
         for service with the Seller, its Affiliates or their predecessors under
         the Purchaser's stock option plans.

                  (d)      All Other Purchaser Plans. For purposes of the
         Purchaser Benefit Plans other than as described in Section 11.3(a), (b)
         or (c), each Transferred Employee shall be given credit for service in
         accordance with the rules of the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plan by
         deeming service to have commenced with the Purchaser from the hire date
         used by the Marconi 401(k) Plan to determine service for the purposes
         of vesting.

         Within 30 days of the date hereof the Seller shall provide the
Purchaser with a list setting forth the hire date used by the Marconi 401(k)
Plan to determine service for vesting purposes for all Current Access Employees
determined as of the date this Agreement was executed; provided, however, that
for purposes of determining this hire date, any individual for whom service to
Jabil was required to be credited under paragraph 2 of the Twelfth Amendment of
the Marconi USA

                                      -82-

Employees' Retirement Plan (the "Marconi Retirement Plan") shall be deemed
service with the Seller.

         11.4     Welfare Benefits. Each Transferred Employee shall be entitled
to coverage effective as of the Closing Date under all of the medical, dental,
vision, prescription drug, life insurance plans or other welfare benefit plans
(the "Purchaser's Welfare Plans") maintained by the Purchaser for its employees,
which medical, dental, vision and prescription drug coverage, through December
31, 2004, shall be available at the same employee contribution rates as applied
under the corresponding welfare benefit plans of the Seller (the "Seller's
Welfare Plans") as of the date of this Agreement. Any waiting periods or
pre-existing condition limitations in the Purchaser's Welfare benefit Plans
shall be waived unless coverage would have been denied on a similar basis under
the Seller's Welfare Plans and deductibles shall be waived for claims incurred
prior to April 1, 2004. The Seller will retain all liabilities for payment of
claims under the Seller's Welfare Plans and none of the Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any Liability under or with respect to the Seller's
Welfare Plans. The Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing
continuing group health coverage, which satisfies the requirements of COBRA
applicable to the Seller and any applicable state laws which require
continuation of health coverage, to all Access Employees (and their eligible
dependents) who incur a qualifying event on or prior to the Closing Date and to
any person who is an M&A qualified beneficiary within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations issued under Section 4980B of the Code. None of the Seller or any of
its Affiliates shall have any Liability under or with respect to the Purchaser's
Benefit Plans, including the Purchaser's Welfare Plans.

         11.5     Paid Time Off. With respect to any accrued but unused paid
time off ("PTO") to which any Transferred Employee is entitled as of the Closing
Date pursuant to the PTO policy applicable to such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "PTO Policy"), the Purchaser shall
assume the liability for accrued PTO of Transferred Employees in the amounts set
forth in the memorandum furnished to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.18(a)
(which amounts shall be updated as of the Closing Date based on accruals from
and after December 6, 2003 (the date as of which accruals were provided in the
memorandum furnished to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.18(a)) consistent
with the PTO Policy in effect as of the date hereof) and shall permit such
Transferred Employees to use such accrued PTO or pay in cash to each such
Transferred Employee an amount equal to the wages relating to any such PTO which
the Purchaser does not permit the Transferred Employee to use. Transferred
Employees shall be entitled to accrue future paid time off under the Purchaser's
vacation policy based on service credited pursuant to Section 11.3 and service
with the Purchaser and its Affiliates after the Closing. Further, effective as
of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall credit each Transferred Employee with 5
sick days.

         11.6     Disability. If a Transferred Employee is on short-term
disability leave as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide such
Transferred Employee with short-term disability benefits in accordance with the
short-term disability policy of the Seller and its Affiliates and the Seller and
its Affiliates shall cease to have any liability for such payments and benefits
after the Closing. The Purchaser shall provide all other Transferred Employees
with short-term disability benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the short-term disability plans of the Purchaser. The Seller shall retain all
liabilities under the long-term disability plan of the Seller, including
liabilities for Transferred Employees who are eligible upon the satisfaction of
any

                                      -83-

<PAGE>

waiting or elimination period to receive benefits under such plan as of the
Closing; provided, however, that if a Transferred Employee returns to active
employment with the Purchaser under conditions that would require a new waiting
or elimination period under the Seller's long-term disability plan, any future
long-term disability benefits shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser and
none of the Seller, its Affiliates or the Seller's long-term disability plan
shall have any responsibility or liability therefor.

         11.7     Bonus. The Purchaser agrees to pay each Transferred Employee
the amount of the bonus that the Purchaser determines would otherwise have been
paid to such Transferred Employee under the terms of the Marconi AIP for service
through March 31, 2004.

         11.8     Retirement Plans. The Seller shall retain all liabilities and
obligations of the Seller and its Affiliates under its "employee pension benefit
plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) (the "Seller's Pension Plans") and
all assets thereunder and none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have
any Liability under or with respect to any "employee pension benefit plans" of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates. The Seller shall cause all Transferred
Employees to become 100% vested in their accrued benefits under the Marconi USA
Wealth Accumulation Plan (the "Marconi 401(k) Plan") and the Marconi Retirement
Plan, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not have any responsibility
with respect to the Seller's Pension Plans. The Purchaser shall cooperate with
the Seller to provide such current information regarding Transferred Employees
as permitted by law on an ongoing basis as may be necessary to facilitate
payment of pension benefits from the Seller's Pension Plans. To the extent
necessary, the Seller shall cause the sponsor of the "Marconi 401(k) Plan" to
amend the Marconi 401(k) Plan to permit, after the Closing Date to the extent
permitted under the requirements of the Code applicable to qualified retirement
plans, Transferred Employees to elect to receive a distribution of benefits
under the Marconi 401(k) Plan and to permit Transferred Employees to elect to
roll over such amounts (including any outstanding loans) to a defined
contribution plan of the Purchaser ("Purchaser 401(k) Plan") satisfying the
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and including a cash or deferred
arrangement satisfying the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code. The
Purchaser shall cause the sponsor of the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to amend the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan to the extent necessary and to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law to accept rollover contributions of all amounts
(including promissory notes evidencing outstanding loans) distributed to or on
behalf of Transferred Employees from the Marconi 401(k) Plan.

         11.9     Workers and Unemployment Compensation. The Seller shall retain
liability for all workers compensation and unemployment events for Access
Employees occurring prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall be
responsible for all workers compensation and unemployment events for Transferred
Employees occurring after the Closing Date.

         11.10    Wages. The Purchaser shall assume liability for all salary,
wages and bonuses earned by Transferred Employees after the Closing Date. The
Seller shall retain all other liability for salary, wages and bonuses earned by
and payable to Access Employees for periods prior to and including the Closing
Date (other than bonuses under the Marconi AIP which are payable by Purchaser in
accordance with Section 11.7).

                                      -84-

         11.11    Severance. The Purchaser agrees to provide to any Transferred
Employee whose employment with the Purchaser and its Affiliates is terminated on
or before the later of December 31, 2004 or nine (9) months after the Closing
Date, severance benefits that are at least equal to the benefits that would have
been provided to such Transferred Employee under the Seller's severance policies
as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Further, the Purchaser shall assume
and satisfy all obligations under the thirteen agreements set forth on Schedule
4.17 that are listed under the heading of "Special Severance Agreements." The
Seller agrees that the Purchaser shall not be responsible for any other
severance obligations of the Seller or its Affiliates to any Access Employees,
whether or not they are Transferred Employees.

         11.12    Cooperation. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser in
its efforts to screen and hire Transferred Employees but only to the extent of
providing non confidential information on Access Employees and in publishing and
disseminating communications of the Purchaser regarding the employment of
Transferred Employees.

         11.13    Employment Claims. Except as otherwise stated in this Article
XI, the Seller shall retain all Liability for all employment related claims of
Access Employees, including claims of violation of state and federal Laws
regarding discrimination, payment of wages, and WARN, and claims of breach of
employment contract and wrongful discharge, arising or relating to the period
prior to the Closing. The Purchaser shall be liable for all employment related
claims made by Transferred Employees, including claims of violation of state and
federal Laws regarding discrimination, payment of wages, and WARN, and claims of
breach of employment contract and wrongful discharge, arising and relating to
the period after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that (a)
the Seller is liable for any WARN notices or payments in lieu of notice for
"mass layoffs" and "plant closings" (as those terms are defined in the WARN Act)
occurring prior to the Closing Date and (b) the Purchaser is liable for any WARN
notices or payments in lieu of notice for "mass layoffs" and "plant closings"
occurring after the Closing Date, including but not limited to any liability for
those persons suffering an employment loss prior to the Closing Date but to whom
notice was not required to be given until the occurrence of events after the
Closing Date.

have been made again by such parties on and as of the Closing Date except to the
extent such representations and warranties are expressly made as of an earlier

IP nor the Parent shall have any liability with respect to claims first asserted

         Agreement, any Conveyance Agreement or any other document delivered by
         the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent hereunder at the Closing that is
         not a Commercial Agreement, provided, that, if the Closing occurs, none
         of the Parent, the Seller or Marconi IP shall have any liability under
         this Section 12.2(a) for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
         representation or warranty unless a claim for indemnification therefor
         is asserted in accordance with Section 12.6 or Section 12.7 (as
         applicable), in each case before the expiration of the survival period
         applicable to such representation or warranty under Section 12.1; and

         and whether or not any breach results or may result in a Business
         Material Adverse Effect or Seller Material Adverse Effect) as if such
         qualifications were deleted from such representation or warranty;

                  (b)      any breach of or failure by the Parent, the Seller or
         Marconi IP to perform any covenant or obligation of the Parent, the
         Seller or Marconi IP set out in this Agreement, any Conveyance
         Agreement or any other document delivered by the Parent, the Seller or
         Marconi IP hereunder at the Closing that is not a Commercial Agreement;

         purpose, "Law" shall not include Judgments to which any of the Seller,
         the Parent or Marconi IP is a party or by which the Access Business or
         the Assets are bound);

                  (d)      the failure by the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent
         to comply with statutory provisions relating to bulk sales and

         with respect to Special Warranty Matters) in excess of $10,000,000 (it
         being understood and agreed that for purposes of this clause (e) the

         out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any kind (including costs and
         expenses for materials and replacement parts or products) incurred by
         the Purchaser or its Affiliates as a result of Section 2.5(c), (ii) for
         purposes of clarification, shall not include any overhead costs or

         Purchaser's customary treatment of its customers for similar claims
         related to the Purchaser's other comparable products or services);

                  (f)      any Personnel that is not a party to an Employee IP

         having or claiming to have any Intellectual Property rights in any
         Transferred Technology or any Transferred Patents developed or
         conceived by such Personnel under circumstances in which, under
         applicable Law, ownership of the Intellectual Property rights in such
         Transferred Technology or Transferred Patents would vest on creation in
         such Personnel in the absence of an Employee IP Agreement; provided
         that the Purchaser or its Affiliates must notify the Seller of any
         claims arising or resulting from the above in accordance with Section
         12.6 or Section 12.7 of this Agreement, as applicable, on or prior to
         the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date; or

         Current Access Product; provided that the Purchaser or its Affiliates
         must notify the Seller of any claims arising or resulting from the
         above in accordance with Section 12.6 or Section 12.7 of this
         Agreement, as applicable, on or prior to the fourth anniversary of the
         Closing Date.

         The Purchaser Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification under this
Article XII shall not be affected by any investigation (including any
environmental or intellectual property investigation or assessment) conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by,
the Purchaser or AFCNA at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation.

         AFCNA nor AFAC shall have any liability under this Section 12.3(a) for
         any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty unless a
         claim for indemnification therefor is asserted in accordance with
         Section 12.6 or Section 12.7 (as applicable), in each case before the
         expiration of the survival period applicable to such representation or
         warranty under Section 12.1; and provided,further, that for purposes of
         Seller Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification pursuant to this
         Section 12.3(a), the representations or warranties of the Purchaser,
         AFCNA and AFAC shall not be qualified by any references therein to
         materiality as if such qualifications were deleted from such
         representation and warranty;

                  (b)      any breach of or failure by the Purchaser, AFCNA or
         AFAC to perform any covenant or obligation of the Purchaser, AFCNA or
         AFAC set out in this Agreement, any Conveyance Agreement or any other
         document delivered by the Purchaser, AFCNA or AFAC hereunder at the
         Closing that is not a Commercial Agreement;

                  (d)      the operation of the Access Business subsequent to
         the Closing (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Retained
         Obligations and the matters for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
         are entitled to indemnification under Section 12.2).

         12.4     Limitations on Liability.

                  (a)      The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the
         right to receive payment by the Parent, the Seller or Marconi IP,

         Seller Indemnified Parties shall have the right to receive payment by

                  (b)      Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates, on the
         one hand, and neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, on the
         other hand, shall have any Liability under this Agreement, any
         Conveyance Agreement or any document delivered by any such Person at

         Agreements and the documents delivered by them at the Closing that are
         not Commercial Agreements exceed the Purchase Price in the aggregate.

                  (c)      EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS
         AGREEMENT, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE SELLER AND ITS
         AFFILIATES TO THE PURCHASER AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND THE SOLE AND
         EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE PURCHASER AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THE SELLER
         AND ITS AFFILIATES, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONVEYANCE AGREEMENTS AND
         THE OTHER DOCUMENTS DELIVERED HEREUNDER THAT ARE NOT COMMERCIAL
         AGREEMENTS OR IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
         THEREBY (INCLUDING FOR ANY BREACH OF OR INACCURACY IN ANY
         REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY COVENANT OR
         OBLIGATION OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON), AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY
         OF THE PURCHASER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND OF THE SELLER AND ITS
         AFFILIATES (RESPECTIVELY) WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL
         BE AS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE XII, SECTION 6.5, SECTION 6.11(E) AND
         SECTION 13.20 OF THIS AGREEMENT, and section 6.14 of the Cross License
         Agreement, Section 6.14 of the Sublicense Attached hereto as Exhibit
         H-1 and Section 7.14 of the Sublicense attached hereto as Exhibit H-2.
         Except with respect to Losses arising out of or relating to a breach of
         the Commercial Agreements, to the extent that the Purchaser or any of
         its Affiliates (on the one hand) or the Seller or its Affiliates (on
         the other hand) has any Losses for which it may assert any right to
         indemnification, contribution or other monetary recovery from the
         Seller or any of its Affiliates or from the Purchaser or any of its
         Affiliates (as the case may be) (whether under this Agreement, any
         Conveyance Agreement, any other document delivered hereunder that is
         not a Commercial Agreement or under any common law theory or any
         statute or other Law, including any Environmental Law, or otherwise),
         other than pursuant to the provisions of this Article XII, the
         Purchaser and the Seller (respectively) each hereby waives, releases
         and agrees not to assert such right, and the Purchaser and the Seller
         (respectively) each agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to waive,
         release and agree not to assert such right.

                  (d)      Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
         have any liability under or otherwise in connection with this
         Agreement, any Conveyance Agreement or any other document delivered

         12.6     Claims. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after
becoming aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving
a claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or Proceeding, of the type
described in Section 12.7, the Indemnified Person shall give written notice to
the Indemnifying Person of such claim, which notice shall specify the material
facts alleged to constitute the basis for such claim, including, if applicable,
the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations alleged to have been
breached, if known, and the amount (if known) that the Indemnified Person seeks
hereunder from the Indemnifying Person, together with such information (to the
extent known by the Indemnified Person) as may be necessary for the Indemnifying
Person to determine that the limitations in Section 12.4 have been satisfied or
do not apply; provided, that, the failure of the Indemnified Person to give such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this
Article XII except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person
demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby. Unless it would reasonably be
expected that the Indemnified Person will be prejudiced by such two-week delay,
for a period of at least two weeks from the date the Indemnifying Person
receives the written notice of a claim pursuant to this Section 12.6, the
Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall consult with each other
regarding resolution of such claim and attempt to resolve such claim; provided
that neither party shall be obligated to take or refrain from taking any action
to enforce its rights.

         12.7     Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense.

                  (a)      The Indemnified Person shall give notice to the
         Indemnifying Person within fifteen (15) days of the assertion of any
         claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or Proceeding, by any
         Person not a party hereto (such claim, suit, action or Proceeding, as
         it pertains to the Indemnified Person, a "Third Party Claim") in
         respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement (which
         notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount (to the
         extent known by the Indemnified Person) of such claim together with
         such information (to the extent known by the Indemnified Person) as may
         be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that the
         limitations in Section 12.4 have been satisfied or do not apply);
         provided, that, the failure of the Indemnified Person to give such
         notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
         under this Article XII except to the extent (if any) that the
         Indemnifying Person demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby.

                  (b)      The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense,
         defend the Indemnified Person against the Third Party Claim with
         counsel of its own choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
         Person so long as (i) the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified
         Person in writing, within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified
         Person has given notice of the Third Party Claim, that the Indemnifying
         Person will indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any
         Losses the Indemnified Person may suffer resulting from, or arising out
         of such Third Party Claim (whether or not otherwise required
         hereunder), (ii) the Indemnifying Person possesses financial resources
         that would reasonably be expected to be sufficient to defend against
         the Third Party Claim and to fulfill its indemnification obligations
         hereunder, (iii) the Third Party Claim does not seek an injunction or
         other equitable relief that would adversely impact the Access Business,
         if granted, (iv) the Third Party Claim does not relate to or arise in
         connection with any criminal action, indictment, allegation,
         investigation or Proceeding, (v) the

                                      -90-

<PAGE>


         Third Party Claim does not relate to or arise in connection with any
         action, allegation, investigation or Proceeding involving (A)
         Transferred Intellectual Property or (B) other Intellectual Property
         licensed to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under the Cross
         License Agreement or either Sublicense if the Purchaser's (or its
         Affiliate's) operation of the Access Business is the primary focus of
         such Third Party Claim, (vi) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with
         respect to, the Third Party Claim would not reasonably be likely to
         establish a precedential custom or practice that would reasonably be
         expected to be materially adverse to the continuing business interests
         of the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates, (vii) the Indemnified
         Person has not been advised in writing by counsel reasonably acceptable
         to the Indemnifying Person that, based on the defenses and positions
         expected to be asserted as of the time of such advice, a conflict of
         interest between the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person
         exists or would reasonably be expected to exist or arise in connection
         with such Third Party Claim and (viii) the Indemnifying Person conducts
         the defense of the Third Party Claim with substantially the same amount
         of diligence as the Indemnifying Person would, acting with a reasonable
         degree of prudence, exert in defending a comparable claim against
         itself; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall
         in all cases be entitled to retain the defense of (1) any Third Party
         Claim pending on the date hereof that is a Retained Obligation and (2)
         so long as the foregoing clauses (ii), (iv), (vii) and (viii) are
         satisfied, (x) any Third Party Claim relating to or arising in
         connection with any action, allegation, investigation or Proceeding
         involving Intellectual Property licensed to the Purchaser or any of its
         Affiliates under the Cross License Agreement or either Sublicense
         (other than Third Party Claims of the type described in the foregoing
         clause (v)(B)) and (y) any claims described in Section 12.2(g). If the
         Indemnified Person assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim
         pursuant to the previous sentence, the Indemnifying Person shall have
         the right to consult with the Indemnified Person regarding the counsel
         used by the Indemnified Person in connection with such defense.

                  (c)      So long as the Indemnifying Person is conducting the
         defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 12.7(b)
         above, (i) the Indemnified Person may, at its election, retain separate
         co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense
         of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Person will not consent
         to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise
         with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
         of the Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed), (iii) the Indemnifying Person will not consent to
         the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise
         with respect to the Third Party Claim unless either (A) the
         Indemnifying Person obtains a written agreement releasing the
         Indemnified Person from all Loss and Liability thereunder, (B) the
         settlement agreement entered into in connection therewith includes a
         written agreement releasing the Indemnified Person from all Loss and
         Liability thereunder or (C) the Indemnifying Person obtains the written
         consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iv) if the Third Party Claim
         relates to or arises in connection with any action, allegation,
         investigation or Proceeding involving Intellectual Property licensed to
         the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under the Cross License
         Agreement or either Sublicense, the Indemnifying Person shall defend
         any such Third Party Claim with a view only to the interest of the
         Purchaser and its Affiliates (it being understood and agreed that use
         of the

                                      -91-

<PAGE>

         same counsel for the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying
         Parties will not, in and of itself, be deemed to result in a conclusion
         that the Indemnifying Party is not acting with a view only to the
         interest of the Purchaser and its Affiliates) and shall consult with
         the Purchaser at all reasonable times as may be reasonably requested by
         the Purchaser concerning matters specified by the Purchaser related to
         the defense of any such Third Party Claim.

                  (d)      In the event any of the conditions in Section 12.7(b)
         above is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnified Person
         may assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim and may
         consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
         compromise with respect thereto (subject to the prior consent of the
         Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
         or delayed), (ii) the Indemnifying Person may participate in such
         defense at its sole cost and expense and will, subject to the terms and
         conditions of Article XII, reimburse the Indemnified Person for the
         fees, costs and expenses of defending against the Third Party Claim
         (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and (iii) the
         Indemnifying Person will remain responsible for any Losses the
         Indemnified Person may suffer resulting from or arising out of the
         Third Party Claim, subject to the applicable limitations provided in
         this Article XII.

                  (e)      Whether or not the Indemnifying Person assumes the
         defense of the Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall
         cooperate in the defense thereof.

         12.8     Time Limits. Any right to indemnification or other recovery
under Section 12.2(a) or under Section 12.3(a) shall only apply to Losses
arising from claims with respect to which the Indemnified Person shall have
notified the applicable Indemnifying Person in writing within the applicable
survival period set forth in Section 12.1; provided, however, that such rights
(and the Indemnifying Parties' obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
hereunder) shall not terminate with respect to any Losses arising from claims as
to which the Indemnified Person shall have, before the expiration of the
applicable survival period, previously delivered a notice pursuant to Section
12.6 or Section 12.7 to the Indemnifying Person.

         12.9     Net Losses and Subrogation.

                  (a)      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
         contrary, the amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by any
         Indemnified Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any
         insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Person (or any of its
         Affiliates) with respect to such Losses and (ii) any recoveries
         obtained by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any
         other third party, in each case less the out-of-pocket costs reasonably
         incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with obtaining such
         proceeds or recoveries (including the amount of the first retrospective
         or experience-based insurance premium adjustment to the extent
         resulting therefrom). Each Indemnified Person (or any of its
         Affiliates) shall exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain such
         proceeds and recoveries. If any such proceeds or recoveries are
         received by an Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with
         respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Person has made a payment
         to the Indemnified Person with respect thereto, the Indemnified Person
         (or such Affiliate) shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Person

                                      -92-

<PAGE>

         the amount of such proceeds or recoveries (up to the amount of the
         Indemnifying Person's payment).

                  (b)      Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Person in
         respect of any Losses, the Indemnifying Person will, to the extent of
         such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Person
         (and its Affiliates) against any third party in respect of the Losses
         to which such payment relates except for third parties, other than
         insurers, if providing the Indemnifying Party such a right of
         subrogation would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
         impact on a then-current or then-proposed bona fide commercial
         relationship between the Indemnified Person and such third party. Such
         Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Person will
         execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence
         or further perfect such subrogation rights.

         12.10    Purchase Price Adjustments. To the extent permitted by Law,
any amounts payable under Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 shall be treated by the
parties hereto as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

         12.11    Reimbursement of Expenses. The Indemnifying Person shall
reimburse the Indemnified Person on an as-incurred basis for any expenses for
which the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder unless
there is a dispute about whether the Indemnified Person is in fact entitled to
indemnification (it being understood that this provision is not intended to
negate a party's right to dispute a claim for indemnification in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement).

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         13.1     Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically contemplated by
this Agreement, each party hereto shall bear its own fees and expenses with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that (a) the
filing fees under the HSR Act and (b) the fees and expenses of any economist or
other expert retained with the mutual agreement of each of the Seller and the
Purchaser in connection with the filing under the HSR Act shall each be borne
equally by the Seller and the Purchaser.

         13.2     Amendment. Except as provided in Section 13.17, this Agreement
may be amended, modified or supplemented only in writing signed by the
Purchaser, AFCNA, the Parent, the Seller and Marconi IP.

         13.3     Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to
be given hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to

intended recipient, and if not so sent on such a day and at such a time, on the

or to such other individual or address as a party hereto may designate for
itself by notice given as herein provided.

         13.4     Payments in Dollars. Except as otherwise provided herein or in
a Related Agreement, all payments pursuant hereto shall be made by wire transfer
in Dollars in same day or immediately available funds without any set-off,
deduction or counterclaim whatsoever.

         13.5     Waivers. Except as otherwise provided in Article XII, the
failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require performance of any
provision hereof or claim damages with respect thereto shall in no manner affect
its right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any
condition or of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver
in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any
other condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or
warranty.

         13.6     Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; provided, that, except with the written consent of the other parties,
no assignment of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, by
operation of law or otherwise, may be made by any party, other than to an
Affiliate of such party (but no such assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of its obligations hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as
any such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound by the applicable terms of this
Agreement, the Purchaser may (i) assign any or all of its rights and interests
hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, and (ii) designate one or more of
its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (and in such case the
Purchaser nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations hereunder). For a period of four (4) years from the date hereof, the
Parent agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, sell, convey, assign,
transfer, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, more than 90% of its
properties or assets (as measured on a net book value basis) to any Person in
one or more related transactions unless, prior to or concurrently with such
disposition, (a) such Person agrees, in writing reasonably satisfactory to and
for the express benefit of Purchaser and AFCNA, to be bound by the Parent's
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and (b) the Purchaser is provided with an
original executed copy of such agreement. Any purported sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer, lease, license or other disposition in violation of this
Section 13.6 shall be null and void.

         13.7     No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the parties hereto and, to the extent expressly provided herein,
their respective Affiliates (and, solely

                                      -95-

<PAGE>

with respect to Article XII, the Indemnified Persons as defined therein), and no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon other third parties
any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

         13.8     Publicity. Prior to the Closing Date, no public announcement
or other publicity regarding the existence of this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreements or their contents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be made by the Purchaser, the Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, without the prior written agreement of the
Purchaser and the Seller, in any case, as to form, content, timing and manner of
distribution or publication. Nothing in this Section 13.8 is intended to limit
or otherwise affect a party's rights to disclose confidential information or
make a public announcement, in each case as provided in Section 6.9 of this
Agreement.

         13.9     Further Assurances. Upon the reasonable request of the
Purchaser, the Seller and Marconi IP shall on and after the Closing Date,
without further consideration, execute and deliver, and cause to be executed and
delivered, to the Purchaser such deeds, assignments and other instruments, and
take such other reasonable actions, as may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser and are required or desirable to effectuate completely the transfer
and assignment to the Purchaser and AFCNA of the Seller's and Marconi IP's
right, title and interest in and to the Assets, and to otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

         13.10    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable
provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

         13.11    Entire Understanding. This Agreement, the Related Agreements
and the December CA set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
and supersede any and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings
among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.

         13.12    Language. The Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP, the Purchaser
and AFCNA agree that the language used in this Agreement is the language chosen
by the parties to express their mutual intent, and that no rule of strict
construction is to be applied against the Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP, the
Purchaser or AFCNA. Each of the Parent, the Seller, Marconi IP, the Purchaser
and AFCNA and their respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated the terms of
this Agreement.

         13.13    Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New
York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

         13.14    Remittances. All remittances, payments, mail and other
communications relating to the Assets or the Assumed Obligations received by the
Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent at any time after the Closing Date shall be
promptly turned over to the Purchaser by the Seller, Marconi IP or the Parent.
All remittances, payments, mail and other communications relating to the

<PAGE>

Excluded Assets or the Retained Obligations received by the Purchaser or AFCNA
at any time after the Closing Date shall be promptly turned over to the Seller
by the Purchaser or AFCNA.

         13.15    Bulk Sales. The Purchaser and AFCNA hereby waive compliance by
the Seller and Marconi IP with the provisions of the Laws of any jurisdiction
relating to a bulk sale or transfer of assets that may be applicable to the
transfer of the Assets.

         13.16    Jurisdiction of Disputes; Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party to
this Agreement hereby: (a) agrees that any litigation, Proceeding or other legal
action in connection with or relating to this Agreement, any Related Agreement
or any matters contemplated hereby or thereby, shall be brought by any party in
a court of competent jurisdiction located within the County of New York, in the
State of New York, whether a state or federal court; (b) agrees that in
connection with any such litigation, Proceeding or action, such party will
consent and submit to personal jurisdiction in any such court described in
clause (a) of this Section 13.16 and to service of process upon it in accordance
with the rules and statutes governing service of process; (c) agrees to waive to
the full extent permitted by Law any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the venue of any such litigation, Proceeding or action in any such court or
that any such litigation, Proceeding or action was brought in an inconvenient
forum; (d) designates, appoints and directs CT Corporation System as its
authorized agent to receive on its behalf service of any and all process and
documents in any such litigation, Proceeding or action in the County of New
York, in the State of New York; (e) agrees to notify the other parties to this
Agreement immediately if such agent shall refuse to act, or be prevented from
acting, as agent and, in such event, promptly to designate another agent in the
County of New York, in the State of New York to serve in place of such agent and
deliver to the other parties written evidence of such substitute agent's
acceptance of such designation; (f) agrees as an alternative method of service
to service of process in any such litigation, Proceeding or action by mailing of
copies thereof to such party at its address set forth in Section 13.3; (g)
agrees that any service made as provided herein shall be effective and binding
service in every respect; and (h) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the
rights of any party to effect service of process in any other manner permitted
by Law. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND ABSOLUTELY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH, ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY,
AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE TO EFFECT SUCH
WAIVER.

         13.17    Schedules. Neither the specification of any Dollar amount or
any item or matter in any provision of this Agreement or any Related Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any Schedule hereto or
thereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item or matter so specified or included, or other items or matters, are or
are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the specification of any
such amount or the specification or inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any item or matter is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or any Related Agreement.
Neither the specification of any item or matter in any provision of this
Agreement or any Related Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or
matter in any Schedule hereto or thereto is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the specification or the inclusion
of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between

                                      -97-

<PAGE>

the parties as to whether any item or matter is or is not in the ordinary course
of business for purposes of this Agreement or any Related Agreement. The Seller,
Marconi IP and the Parent shall, from time to time until the Closing, by notice
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, promptly after acquiring
knowledge of any such matter, supplement or amend the Schedules hereto with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered that, if existing or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Schedules hereto; provided, however, that no supplement or
amendment to any Schedule (other than Schedule 4.18(c)), shall have any effect
for (a) the purpose of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1 or (b) except as provided in the following sentence, for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty herein or
whether any Person is otherwise in breach of this Agreement or whether any
Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article XII or to any other
remedy permitted under the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding clause (b)
of the previous sentence, if the Closing occurs, any such supplement or
amendment of the Schedules, to the extent relating to (i) a matter arising after
the date hereof which is expressly assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.5(c) or (ii) the matters described in Section 4.25, will be effective to cure
and correct for purposes of the Seller's and its Affiliates' indemnification
obligations under Article XII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which would have existed if the
Seller had not made such supplement or amendment, and all references to any
Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended as provided in this sentence
shall, for purposes of the Seller's and its Affiliates' indemnification
obligations under Article XII after the Closing, be deemed to be a reference to
such Schedule as so supplemented or amended.

         13.18    Disclaimer of Warranties. The Seller, Marconi IP and the
Parent make no representations or warranties with respect to any projections,
forecasts or forward-looking statements made available to the Purchaser. There
is no assurance that any projected or forecasted results will be achieved. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not apply to any forward-looking
representation or warranty herein or in any Related Agreement or any
forward-looking statement made in the Schedules. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE
EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
RELATED AGREEMENTS, (a) THE SELLER, MARCONI IP AND THE PARENT ARE SELLING THE
ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AND (b) THE SELLER,
MARCONI IP AND THE PARENT MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATED AGREEMENTS, THE SELLER AND MARCONI IP DISCLAIM
ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY INDUSTRY
CUSTOM OR COURSE OF DEALING. THE PURCHASER AND AFCNA ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
THEY ARE NOT RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RELATED
AGREEMENTS. The Purchaser and AFCNA acknowledge and agree that neither the
Seller, Marconi IP, the Parent, their respective Affiliates, any of their
respective Representatives nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any

                                      -98-

<PAGE>

memoranda, charts, summaries, schedules or other information heretofore made
available by the Seller, Marconi IP, the Parent, their respective Affiliates or
their respective Representatives to the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
their Representatives (including the Confidential Descriptive Memorandum dated
December 2002) or any information that is not included in or covered by this
Agreement, the Related Agreements or the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and
thereto, and neither the Seller, Marconi IP, the Parent, their respective
Affiliates, any of their respective Representatives nor any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability to the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
their Representatives resulting from the distribution of any such information
to, or the use of any such information by, the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates
or any of their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other
representatives.

         13.19    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

         13.20    Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that (a) any Pre-Closing Specific Performance Covenants are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms prior to the Closing or (b)
any Post-Closing Specific Performance Covenants are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms subsequent to the Closing. It is accordingly agreed
that (i) prior to the Closing, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the Pre-Closing Specific Performance
Covenants and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof and (ii)
subsequent to the Closing, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the Post-Closing Specific Performance
Covenants and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, in each
case, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity; provided, however, that all monetary liability shall be subject to
Article XII.

Compensation and Benefits, the Other Current Liabilities and the Special
Warranty Reserve (such net amount being the "Closing Working Capital") and (ii)
deliver the same to the Seller, together with a certificate from the Purchaser's
independent auditors to the effect that the initial draft Statement of Working
Capital has been prepared in accordance with Section 3.2(g).

         4        The first sentence of Section 6.9(a) of the Agreement is
hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The parties have previously
entered into several confidentiality agreements covering specific purposes
(collectively, the "Other Confidentiality Agreements"), and a confidentiality
agreement dated December 6, 2002 (as amended, the "December CA") specifically
addressing the purchase transaction contemplated by this Agreement."

         5.       Section 6.17 of the Agreement is hereby amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

(a)      Without limiting the parties' other obligations under this Article VI,
         the Seller agrees to prepare a statement of Assets to be acquired by
         the Purchaser and Assumed Obligations as of December 31, 2003, and the
         related statements of operations and of cash flows for the year then
         ended (the "2003 Financial Statements"), including related footnotes,
         otherwise (except for the omission of assets not acquired and
         liabilities not assumed) in conformity with accounting principles
         generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), and agrees to
         engage the Seller's independent public accountants, Deloitte & Touche
         LLP ("Deloitte"), to commence an audit of the 2003 Financial Statements
         under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States (the
         "Audit"). Promptly after execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall
         use its reasonable best efforts to prepare the 2003 Financial
         Statements on the basis provided in this paragraph (a), and cause
         Deloitte to commence and complete the Audit of such financial
         statements as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of the
         engagement letter. The Seller agrees to cause such

<PAGE>

         engagement letter to be prepared, and the Seller will be prepared to
         execute such letter on its own behalf, promptly after the date hereof.
         The Seller and the Purchaser will both be signatories to Deloitte's
         engagement letter for the Audit. The Seller represents that the 2003
         Financial Statements will fairly present the financial condition,
         results of operations and cash flows of the Access Business as of and
         for the applicable period, and will be consistent with the books and
         records of the Seller.

(b)      Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Parent shall, and shall cause
         their Affiliates to, cooperate fully with Deloitte in connection with
         the Audit, including providing Deloitte with reasonable access to
         personnel, books and records as is requested by Deloitte to complete
         the Audit. Subsequent to the Closing, each of the Seller and the Parent
         shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable
         best efforts to cooperate fully with the Purchaser, Deloitte and any
         other auditors of the Purchaser in connection with the Audit and the
         financial statements that are the subject of the Audit, including (i)
         providing reasonable access to personnel, books and records (including
         reasonable access to personnel, books and records of the Other
         Businesses to the extent necessary) as may be requested by Deloitte to
         complete the Audit, (ii) cooperating with the reasonable requests of
         the Purchaser and its independent accountants in order to permit the
         Purchaser and its Affiliates to prepare and submit the Request and to
         respond to inquiries or other demands of any Governmental Entity
         (including the Securities Exchange Commission) related to such
         financial statements of the Access Business or to confirm the
         information upon which such financial statements are based (including
         for purposes of any "comfort letter" requested by the Purchaser), and
         (iii) facilitating discussions between the Purchaser and Deloitte with
         respect to the completed Audit to the extent reasonably requested by
         the Purchaser. The Seller and the Parent acknowledge and agree that the
         foregoing cooperation could involve the provision of information
         concerning non-Access Business units (such as the Other Businesses) to
         the extent relevant to the preparation and audit of such financial
         statements of the Access Business, provided, that, such information
         will be provided only to the auditors (and not to the Purchaser except
         to the extent reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in clause
         (ii) above), subject to customary confidentiality restrictions. It is
         acknowledged and agreed that it is the intention of the parties to
         facilitate the completion of the Audit as soon as reasonably
         practicable after the date hereof.

(c)      As soon as reasonably practicable after issuance of Deloitte's report
         on the Audit of the 2003 Financial Statements, the Seller shall provide
         a copy of the 2003 Financial Statements and an Audit report to the
         Purchaser. After the delivery of the 2003 Financial Statements and
         Audit report by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
         reimburse the Seller for all fees and reasonably documented expenses
         billed by Deloitte (consistent with their engagement letter) and paid
         by the Seller in connection with the Audit, within five (5) Business
         Days of the presentation to the Purchaser of reasonably detailed
         documentation of such fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         (i) if the Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
         10.1(c)(i), then the Seller shall be responsible for all fees and
         expenses of Deloitte in connection with the Audit and shall promptly
         reimburse the Purchaser for any and all fees and expenses paid by the
         Purchaser to Deloitte directly or to the Seller pursuant to the
         reimbursement provisions of the immediately preceding sentence and (ii)
         if this Agreement is terminated other than (A) by

                                       2

<PAGE>

         the Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(i) or (B) by the Seller
         pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i), then the Purchaser and the Seller shall
         share equally all fees and expenses of Deloitte in connection with the
         Audit and the Seller shall promptly reimburse the Purchaser for
         one-half of any and all fees and expenses paid by the Purchaser to
         Deloitte directly or to the Seller pursuant to the reimbursement
         provisions of the immediately preceding sentence.

(d)      Until the Audit report has been delivered to the Purchaser, the Seller
         shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange a weekly conference
         call with the Purchaser at a mutually agreeable time at which
         representatives of the Seller will inform the Purchaser of the timing
         and general status of the Audit. The Seller represents that such
         information will accurately summarize the timing and status of the
         Audit in all material respects.

(e)      With respect to each quarterly financial reporting period ending prior
         to the Closing Date, commencing with the calendar quarter ending March
         31, 2004, the Seller will prepare financial statements on a basis
         consistent with the 2003 Financial Statements per Section 6.17(a) as of
         and for the applicable quarterly period ended (the "Interim Financial
         Statements"). The Seller agrees to engage Deloitte to perform an audit
         of the Interim Financial Statements under auditing standards generally
         accepted in the United States (the "Interim Audit"). The Seller shall
         use its reasonable best efforts to prepare the Interim Financial
         Statements and cause Deloitte to commence and complete the Interim
         Audit as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the applicable
         quarter. The Seller represents such Interim Financial Statements will
         fairly present the financial condition, results of operations and cash
         flows of the Access Business as of and for the applicable period, and
         will be consistent with the books and records of the Seller, subject
         only to the absence of footnotes. The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c)
         and (d) of this Section 6.17 will apply to the parties' obligations
         replacing "the Audit" with "the Interim Audit" as applicable and
         replacing "the 2003 Financial Statements" with "the Interim Financial
         Statements" as applicable.

         6.       The second sentence of Section 9.1 of the Agreement is hereby
amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The Closing, and all transactions
to occur at the Closing, shall be deemed to have taken place at, and shall be
effective as of, 3:00 p.m. (central standard time) on the Closing Date."

         The provisions of the Agreement that have not been amended hereby shall
remain in full force and effect. The provisions of the Agreement, as amended
hereby, shall remain in full force and effect.

                                      * * *
