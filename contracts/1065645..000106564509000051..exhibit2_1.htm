MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and

later than the second (2nd) Business Day or, in the event the last condition
to be satisfied is the condition set forth in Section 7.02(f), no later than

foregoing, shall take place at such time and on a date to be specified by the

shall be delivered to Acquiror and the Company the certificates and other
documents required to be delivered under Article VII hereof. For avoidance of

2.03 Tax Treatment of the Merger.

 

 

For federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall be treated, with respect to
each holder of Company Common Shares, as a sale of the Company Common Shares
by each holder of those Company Common Shares to Acquiror and/or
any Subsidiary of Acquiror in exchange for the Merger Consideration received
by such holder in the Merger.

 

  

 

 

ARTICLE 3.  

 

 

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

 

3.01 Conversion of Shares.

 

 

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holders of Company Common Shares, holders of any ownership
interests in Merger Subsidiary or any other Person:

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Sections 3.01(b) and 3.01(c), each Company Common
Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right
to receive a cash amount equal to $7.75, without interest (the "Per Share
Amount").

 

 

(b) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Acquiror or by any
Subsidiary of Acquiror, shall automatically be converted into and become one
share of beneficial interest of the Surviving Company and shall constitute
the only issued or outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the Surviving
Company.

 

 

(c) Each Company Common Share that is owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or by Acquiror, Merger Subsidiary or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Acquiror or Merger Subsidiary, shall, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist and no cash, stock or any other consideration shall be paid in
exchange therefor.

 

 

3.02 Exchange Procedures; Exchange Agent

 

 

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall appoint an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Exchange Agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in accordance with an agreement reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated
by Sections 3.01(b) and 3.03(a) and Acquiror shall, at or prior to the
Effective Time, deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares for exchange in
accordance with this Article III, cash in an amount sufficient to make
payments of the Merger

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

Consideration (such aggregate cash consideration being deposited hereinafter
referred to as the "Payment Fund"). Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, payments out of the Payment Fund as
provided for in this Article III and the Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the
Payment Fund shall be paid to Surviving Company.

 

 

(b) Exchange Procedures for Company Common Shares. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who immediately prior to the Effective
Time was a holder of record of Company Common Shares (other than Company
Common Shares held by Acquiror, Merger Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of
Acquiror or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time) (i) a
letter of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass only upon
delivery of the certificate or certificates (collectively, "Certificates"),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced Company Common Shares,
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Acquiror may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Per
Share Amount. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
by check an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share Amount
for each Company Common Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate. Such
payment of the Per Share Amount shall be sent to such holder by the Exchange
Agent promptly after receipt by the Exchange Agent of such Certificate,
together with such Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, and the Company Common
Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. The right of any shareholder to receive the Per Share Amount,
shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable withholding obligation as
set forth in Section 3.05. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable upon the surrender of a Certificate.

 

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Article III, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Per Share Amount in respect of the Company Common Shares formerly evidenced by
such Certificate as contemplated by this Section 3.02. All cash paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares evidenced by such Certificates.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
on the records of the Company, and if Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Company, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article III.

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

(d) Unregistered Transfer of Stock. If payment of the Per Share Amount is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and any other Taxes required by reason of the payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 

 

(e) Lost Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Amount
payable pursuant to this Article III.

 

 

(f) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
unclaimed by the former holders of Company Common Shares one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company. Any such holders
who have not complied with this Article III prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of the Per Share
Amount (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws). Any such
portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common
Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled
thereto.

 

 

(g) No Liability. None of Acquiror, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, trustee, shareholder,
partner, member, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

3.03 Share Appreciation Rights; Restricted Stock

 

 

(a) Each of the Share Appreciation Rights that are issued and outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Current Share Appreciation
Rights"), whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and
in lieu thereof, the holder of each such Current Share Appreciation Right will
be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the base price per share of
Company Common Shares under such Current Share Appreciation Right (but not
less than zero) multiplied by (ii) the number of Company Common Shares subject
to such Current Share Appreciation Right, without interest (the
"Share Appreciation Right Consideration"). The aggregate Share Appreciation
Right Consideration payable to all holders of Current Share

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

Appreciation Rights together with the aggregate Per Share Amount payable to
all holders of Company Common Shares is referred to herein as the "Merger
Consideration."

 

 

(b) Restricted Shares. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
Restricted Shares that, pursuant to the terms thereof, vest automatically upon
the consummation of a change of control or similar transaction shall become
fully vested in accordance with their terms, and each such Restricted Share
shall be considered an outstanding Company Common Share for all purposes of
this Agreement, including the right to receive the Per Share Amount. Any
Restricted Shares that, pursuant to the terms thereof, do not vest
automatically upon the consummation of a change of control or similar
transaction shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and
retired and no cash, stock or any other consideration shall be paid in
exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) Corporate Action. Prior to the Effective Time and subject to and
conditional upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall take such
actions as it deems necessary or desirable to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 3.03.

 

 

3.04 Adjustments

 

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common
Shares shall be changed into a different number, class or series of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Per Share Amount
payable with respect thereto and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

 

3.05 Withholding Taxes

 

 

Acquiror, the Exchange Agent, or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable in
connection with the Merger to a holder of any Company Common Shares or Share
Appreciation Rights any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under the
Code, the Treasury Regulations, or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law and shall, to the extent so withheld, promptly pay or cause to be paid
any such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority as required by
applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of such Company Common Shares or Share Appreciation Rights
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Company Bylaws.

 

 

(iii) The Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes
entitled to be cast by the holders of all outstanding Company Common Shares as
of the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting (the "Company
Shareholder Approval"). The Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of shares of the Company necessary to

(iv) The Company Charter Amendment requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds
of all votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all outstanding Company

is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of shares of the
Company necessary to approve the Company Charter Amendment.

 

 

(d) No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 5.02(d) of the Disclosure Letter, the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and all documents and

federal, state, municipal or local statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule,
code, executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or other order of any
Governmental Authority ("Law") applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (C) require any consent under, or
result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien or other encumbrance on
any

 

 

 

 

 

 

25

Disclosure Letter lists all consents and approvals required to be obtained by
the Company in connection with the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder (the "Consents").

 

 

(ii) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and all

necessary for each of the Company or its Subsidiaries to own, lease, develop
and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and develop its properties as contemplated by the Permits (the
"Applicable Permits"), and all such Permits are valid and in full force and
effect, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, or any appeal or litigation related to, any of the Applicable Permits
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of, or any appeal or litigation related to, any of
the Applicable Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, or any appeal or litigation related to, any of the Applicable
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries conducts its business in

bound. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notification from any Governmental Authority asserting that it is not

no outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to any of the

any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports, as amended prior to the date
hereof, was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes

financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein except as otherwise noted therein

since December 31, 2008, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries had
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth in a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company or in the notes thereto.

 

 

(iv) The Company is in compliance, and has complied, in all material respects

27  

 

(g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in the SEC

not been any changes, effects or circumstances or events, individually or in
the aggregate, that have resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(h) Litigation. As of the date hereof, except (i) as listed in
Section 5.02(h) of the Disclosure Letter, (ii) as set forth in the SEC

adequate insurance (subject to customary deductibles), there is no Action
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective properties or assets, or
related to the Applicable Permits. None of the matters identified in Section
5.02(h) of the Disclosure Letter would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or to question the validity of this Agreement
or any action to be taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with the consummation of the Merger. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries are subject to any order, judgment, writ, injunction or decree of
any Governmental Authority, except as would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

(i) Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 

(i) Section 5.02(i)(i) of the Disclosure Letter lists (A) all material
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and (B) all

28  

 

(ii) Each Benefit Plan has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code, except where such failure
to operate such Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law
would not, or would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. No material Action, claim or proceeding
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any
Benefit Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that would give rise to
any such material Action, claim or proceeding. Neither the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other "disqualified
person" or "party in interest", as defined in Section 4975 of the Code and
Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively, has engaged in any non-exempt
"prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA, with respect to any Benefit Plan. To the knowledge of the
Company, no fiduciary violations under Title I of ERISA have occurred with
respect to any Benefit Plan.

 

 

(iii) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has timely received a favorable determination or opinion letter
from the IRS and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has
occurred since the date of any such determination or opinion letter that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Benefit Plan. Each trust established in connection with any Benefit Plan which
is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code is so exempt.

 

 

(iv) All contributions and benefits required to have been made or paid under
any of the Benefit Plans or by Law (without regard to any waivers granted
under Section 412 of the Code), have been timely made in all material
respects.

 

 

(v) [RESERVED]

 

 

(vi) No Benefit Plan is, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
contributes to or has at any time contributed to any Benefit Plan that is, (i)
a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (ii) a
"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code),
or (iii) any single employer plan or other pension plan that is subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Benefit Plan
is an employee stock ownership plan within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7)
of the Code or otherwise invests in employer securities as defined in Section
409(l) of the Code.

 

 

(vii) Except as set forth in Section 5.02(i)(vii) of the Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will accelerate the vesting,
amount, funding or time of payment of any compensation, equity award or other
benefit.

 

 

(viii) Except as set forth in Section 5.02(i)(viii) of the Disclosure Letter,
none of the Benefit Plans provide for continuing post-employment health, life
insurance coverage or

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

other welfare benefits for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant
except as may be required under any Law.

 

 

(ix) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its

such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts
or other material made available to Acquiror or Merger Subsidiary in online
"data rooms," confidential information memoranda or management interviews and
presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

the Company nor any other Person or entity on behalf of the Company makes any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall

pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state
banking laws (other than reports or documents which the Company is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably
request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of the Company's customers, jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, provided that, if
requested to do so by Acquiror, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to redact proprietary data from any requested materials or
documentation, obtain a waiver from any applicable counterparty or take such
other action as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror. Acquiror shall, and
cause its representatives to, take all reasonable efforts to prevent such
access and inspection from interfering with the business operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(8) release any Person from or fail to enforce any standstill agreement or
similar obligation to the Company and its Subsidiaries other than the

an Acquisition Proposal, an "Excluded Party"), as determined, with respect to
any Excluded Party, by the Company Board or the Company Special Committee no
later than the later of (A) the No-Shop Period Start Date and (B) two (2)
Business Days following the date on which the Company received such Excluded
Party's written Acquisition Proposal (it being understood, that following the
No-Shop Period Start Date until such time as the Company Board or the Company
Special Committee determines that a Person is an Excluded Party, the Company
shall not be permitted to take any action with respect to such Person that it
would be prohibited from taking with respect to a non-Excluded Party pursuant
to Section 6.04(v)), on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives to, immediately
cease and terminate any solicitation, encouragement, discussion, negotiation
or communications with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with respect to any actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal and shall use its (and will cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to use their) reasonable best efforts to
require the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information previously furnished by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to such Persons in accordance
with the terms of any agreement under which such confidential information was
furnished. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any
failure on the part of their respective Representatives to comply with this
Section 6.04(a)(iii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Company shall be permitted, after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
the Company Shareholder Meeting, to continue to engage in discussions,
negotiations or communications regarding a written Acquisition Proposal with
any Excluded Party and to take the actions specified in proviso (x) and (y) of
Section 6.04(a)(v) with respect to any such Excluded Party; provided, that,
upon the determination by the Company Board or the Company Special Committee
at any time after the No-Shop Period Start Date that an Excluded Party's
Acquisition Proposal ceases to satisfy all of the requirements of Section
6.04(a)(v) or the Company Board or the Company Special Committee otherwise
ceases to engage in discussions, negotiations or communications with an
Excluded Party regarding an Acquisition Proposal, (x) such Excluded Party
shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all purposes under this Agreement at
such time as the Acquisition Proposal made by such Excluded Party ceases to
satisfy all of the requirements of Section 6.04(a)(v) or at such time the
Company Board or the Company Special

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

Committee ceases to engage in such discussions, negotiations or communication,
as the case may be, and (y) the Company shall promptly notify Acquiror in
writing of such event (including the identity of the Person that ceases to be
an Excluded Party).

 

 

(iv) The Company shall notify Acquiror in writing of the identity of any party
making a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date that the Company Board or the Company Special Committee believes
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company's
financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal (any such proposal, an "Excluded Acquisition Proposal") and provide
to Acquiror a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any such
Excluded Acquisition Proposal, in each case within two (2) Business Days of
receipt of such Excluded Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary contained in
Section 6.04(a)(iii), if at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date
and prior to the time, but not after, the Special Shareholder Approval is
obtained, (A) the Company receives any written Acquisition Proposal which the
Company Board or the Company Special Committee believes in good faith to be
bona fide (that was not solicited, encouraged, facilitated or otherwise
obtained in violation of this Agreement), (B) the Company Board or the Company
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and the Company's financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and (C) after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board or
the Company Special Committee determines that failure to take such action, in
light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be
inconsistent with the trustees' duties under applicable Law, the Company Board
or the Company Special Committee may (directly or through its
Representatives), (x) furnish information to the Person who made such
Acquisition Proposal (provided that the Company shall have received from such
Person, prior to furnishing any such information to such Person, an executed
confidentiality agreement and the Company shall have previously or
concurrently furnished such information to Acquiror and the Merger Subsidiary)
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

(vi) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly
(within 48 hours from initial receipt) notify Acquiror in writing in the event
it receives an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related
Persons, including the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall keep
Acquiror apprised as to the status and any material developments concerning
the same on a current basis (and in any event no later than 36 hours after the
occurrence of such developments). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall promptly (within 24 hours of beginning to provide or engaging in
negotiations) notify Acquiror orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in negotiations concerning an Acquisition
Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons pursuant to Section
6.04(a)(iii) or Section 6.04(a)(v).

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Special Shareholder Approval, (A)
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which constitutes a Superior
Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by
Acquiror pursuant to clause (y) below and the Company Board or the Company
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
trustees' duties under applicable Law, the Company Board or the Company
Special Committee may (1) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal and/or (2)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; or (B) other than as a result of a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board or the Company Special Committee determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the trustees' duties under applicable Law,
the Company Board or the Company Special Committee may effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal; provided, however, with respect to circumstances in clause (A)
only, the Company Board or the Company Special Committee shall not effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal (pursuant to clause (A)(1)) or terminate this
Agreement (pursuant to clause (A)(2)) unless:

 

 

(x) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Acquiror and
Merger Subsidiary, at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the "Notice
Period"), of its intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in response
to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal); and

 

 

(y) prior to effecting such Recommendation Withdrawal or terminating this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors
to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Acquiror and Merger
Subsidiary in good faith (to the extent Acquiror and Merger Subsidiary desire
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are more
favorable to the Company Shareholders than such Superior Proposal.

 

 

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Acquiror and Merger
Subsidiary and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.04(a)(vii)
with respect to such new written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
and enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal
referred to in clause (A)(2) above, and any purported termination pursuant to
the foregoing clause (A)(2) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless
concurrently with such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee and
the Termination Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.03(b). The Company's
right to terminate this Agreement under clause (A)(2) above shall not be
available if the Company has breached, or is then in breach of, Section 6.04.
For

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

avoidance of doubt, in the event the Company seeks to exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 6.04(a)(vii), in
connection with such proposed termination, it may take the action previously
prohibited pursuant to Section 6.04(a)(ii)(6); provided, that clauses (x) and
(y) of Section 6.04(a)(vii) are satisfied.

Special Committee determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with its financial advisor and after taking into account all of the terms and

52

without limitation, taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 

 

6.05 Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts

 

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger, including, without limitation, using its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Applicable Permits, consents, approvals,
waivers, exemptions, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and its Subsidiaries as
are necessary for the consummation of the Merger and to fulfill the conditions
to the Closing. In case, at any time after the Closing, any further action,
including, without limitation, the execution and delivery of any additional
documents or instruments, is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its respective officers, employees and agents to
take all such action. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, the Company shall timely file, or cause to be filed, with the SEC all
SEC Reports required to be so filed by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate and assist one another in connection
with all actions to be taken pursuant to Section 6.05(a), including the
preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested,
amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject
to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all
related documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing,
and to the extent practicable none of the parties will file any such document
or have any communication with any Governmental Authority without prior
consultation with the other parties. Each party shall keep the others
apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent practicable, and as
permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit
representatives of the other party to participate in meetings (whether by
telephone or in Person) with such Governmental Authority. None of the parties
shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting
period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority
without the consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action,
including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to
avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays, prevents
or prohibits

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

 

 

(d) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify
Acquiror with respect to any matter hereafter arising or any information
obtained after the date hereof which, if existing, occurring or known at or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(e) As promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
commence the process of obtaining, and obtain, any third party consents (i)
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) disclosed in the Disclosure Letter or (iii) required to
prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the
Effective Time. In the event that the Company fails to obtain any third party
consent described above, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Acquiror,
to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Acquiror and Merger
Subsidiary and their respective businesses resulting, or which could
reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure
to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the prior written consent of
Acquiror, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash
or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such Person and (ii) neither Acquiror nor Merger Subsidiary
or their respective Affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay such
Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.
All costs, fees and expenses associated with the assumption of any loan made
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be paid by the Company at
Closing; provided, that Acquiror shall pay the fee associated with submitting
an application to a lender for the purpose of initiating the process to obtain
such lender's consent to the Merger under the applicable loan agreement.

 

 

6.06 Public Announcements

 

 

The parties hereto agree that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger shall be issued by
any party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 

 

6.07 Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee, officer, agent,
trustee, director or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any Subsidiaries of the Company, from and after the Effective
Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the
date hereof through the Effective Time serving as a executive officer,
director, trustee or fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries or as a
fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the "Company Indemnified
Parties") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as
now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty days after any
request for advancement, advance to each of the Company Indemnified Parties,
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or
hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness
with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Company Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such
Company Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect
to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the
requirement of any bond or other security (but subject to Acquiror's or
Surviving Company's, as applicable, receipt of a written undertaking by or on
behalf of such Company Indemnified Party, if required by applicable Law, to
repay such Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that
such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified); provided,
however, that neither Acquiror nor Surviving Company shall be liable for any
settlement effected without Acquiror's or the Surviving Company's written
consent and shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (selected by a plurality of the applicable Company Indemnified
Parties) for all Company Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction with respect
to any single Claim except to the extent that two or more of such Company
Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such
action. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company pursuant to this Section 6.07(a) shall extend to acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the consideration and approval
thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim
relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred
hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a trustee,
director, executive officer or fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries
after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Person's heirs,
executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this Section
6.07(a), (i) the term "Claim" means any threatened, asserted, pending or
completed Action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether
instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other
party, that any Company Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to
the institution of any such Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or
other alternative

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that
relate to such Company Indemnified Party's duties or service as a director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing or any other Person at or prior
to the Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) the term "Expenses" means reasonable attorneys' fees
and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including, without
limitation, experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript
fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section
6.07(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or
advancement brought by a Company Indemnified Party. Neither Acquiror nor the
Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding,
inquiry or investigation in respect of which indemnification has been or could
be sought by such Company Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Company
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, demand,
Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation or such Company Indemnified
Party otherwise consents thereto.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror and Merger Subsidiary agree that
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, trustees, officers, other fiduciaries or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws or other
organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) shall be assumed by the
Surviving Company in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms.

 

 

(c) The Surviving Company shall (i) for a period of six years after the
Effective Time cause to be maintained in effect in its charter or bylaws (or
similar governing documents), provisions regarding elimination of liability
of trustees, directors and officers, indemnification of officers, trustees,
directors and employees and advancement of Expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries as those currently contained in
Company Charter or Company Bylaws and (ii) maintain for a period of six years
the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries (provided that the Surviving
Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured, provided that such substitution shall not result
in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the
Effective Time) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time; including, without limitation, in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay annual premiums
for insurance under this Section 6.07(c) which in the aggregate exceed 300% of
the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such purpose;

 

 

 

 

56

   

provided that Acquiror shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage, with respect to the entire six year period following the Effective
Time, as may be obtained for such 300% amount. The provisions of clause (ii)
of this subsection (b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid
policies have been obtained by the Surviving Company for purposes of this
Section 6.07, which policies (together with Company's existing policy) provide
such directors and officers with the coverage described in this subsection (b)
for an aggregate period of not less than six years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

(d) If either the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07. The
parties acknowledge and agree that Acquiror guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Company's obligations pursuant to this Section
6.07.

 

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.07 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.07
applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee and are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or
her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

 

 

6.08 Employee Benefit Matters

 

 

(a) Each individual who is an employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Effective Time (an "Employee") shall continue as an
employee of the Surviving Company or an Affiliate thereof immediately after
the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee").

 

 

(b) To the extent the Surviving Company or an Affiliate thereof maintains any
health, welfare, retirement or paid-time-off benefit plan of the Company,
including without limitation an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA (collectively, the "Surviving Company Benefit Plans"), in which
any Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall cause such Surviving Company Benefit Plan to recognize the
service of each such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time with the
Company and its Affiliates as employment with the Surviving Company and its
Affiliates for purposes of eligibility and benefit entitlement, but not for
purposes of benefit accrual (other than Surviving Company Benefit Plans
providing severance or paid-time-off benefits under which such service will be
recognized), under each such Surviving Company Benefit Plan. In addition, the
Surviving Company shall cause each Surviving Company Benefit Plan, as
applicable, to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions
exclusions, "at-work requirements" and waiting periods, except to the extent
that comparable limitations, "at-work requirements" or waiting periods would
have continued to apply to such Continuing Employees under comparable Benefit

 

 

 

 

 

57  

Plans after the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid under any Benefit Plan in the
plan year immediately preceding the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Surviving
Company Benefit Plans.

 

 

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.08, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other person, including, without limitation, any Continuing
Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

 

6.09 Transfer Taxes

 

 

Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer or stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related
interests, penalties or additions to Tax, "Transfer Taxes"), and shall
cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall pay or cause to be paid,
without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Shares or Current Share Appreciation Rights, all
Transfer Taxes.

 

 

6.10 Tax Matters

 

 

Without limitation of Section 4.01(l), during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:

 

 

(a) continue to operate in such a manner as to permit the Company to continue
to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes throughout
the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time and not to be subject to
U.S. federal income taxation as a corporation;

 

 

(b) prepare and timely file all federal and all other Tax Returns reflecting a
Tax obligation of $25,000 or more that are required to be filed by them
(taking into account all applicable extensions of time to file such Tax
Returns) on or before the Effective Date ("Post-Signing Returns") in a manner
consistent with past practice and with applicable Laws;

 

 

(c) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable by them; and

 

 

(d) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records and
financial statements) for all Taxes payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries which accrue, but are not due, prior to the Effective Time in a
manner consistent with past practice and with applicable Laws.

 

 

6.11 Resignations

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

The Company shall obtain and deliver to Acquiror at the Closing evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror of the resignation effective as of the
Effective Time, of those trustees or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries designated by Acquiror to the Company in writing at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 

 

6.12 Delisting and Deregistering of Securities

 

 

Acquiror and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Common Shares to be delisted from the NYSE Amex and
deregistered under the Exchange Act promptly following the Effective Time.

 

 

6.13 Accumulated Earnings and Profits/Distribution of Inter-Company
Obligations

 

 

(a) Within thirty (30) calendar days after the execution of this Agreement,
but in no event later than twenty (20) calendar days before the Effective
Time, the Company shall provide to Acquiror a good faith written
determination of the accumulated, as well as estimated current, earnings and
profits of American Rental Properties Trust, all of the common shares of which
are owned by the Company ("ARPT"), such determination to be before any
reduction for the distribution to be made by ARPT to the Company as provided
for in Section 6.13(c). The written determination of the Company to be
provided as set forth herein shall contain a certification to the effect that
(i) the determination was prepared by the Company in consultation with Ernst and
Young LLP (which consultation shall include providing Ernst and Young LLP the
Company's calculation underlying its determination and discussions between the
Company and Ernst and Young LLP regarding the Company's calculation), and (ii)
the Company has sought the advice of Ernst and Young LLP as to interpretation
and application of Internal Revenue Code Section 312, the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and relevant related guidance pertaining to the determination of
earnings and profits in light of the specific factual circumstances applicable
to ARPT and its activities and operations.

 

 

(b) In the event that there is any disagreement with respect to the Company's
determination of ARPT's current and/or accumulated earnings and profits, the
Company and Acquiror agree to cooperate and use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with respect to the amount of ARPT's
current and/or accumulated earnings and profits.

 

 

(c) As promptly as possible following the agreement between the Company and
Acquiror of the amount of ARPT's current and accumulated earnings and profits,
if any, in accordance with the foregoing, but in any event no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause ARPT to
make a distribution to the Company of all (or such lesser portion of the
amount as designated by Acquiror) of the inter-company obligations held
directly or indirectly by ARPT; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be obligated to make the foregoing distribution until the condition set forth
in Section 7.01(a) shall have been satisfied and the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(c) shall have been either satisfied or waived by Acquiror. The
foregoing distribution may be effected by declaring a dividend that is

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

contingent on certain future events, but the contingencies shall be removed no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(d) At the request of Acquiror, the Company shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested by the Acquiror to restructure
(including, without limitation, to amend, transfer, or cancel) the inter-
company obligations by and among the Subsidiaries of the Company and/or the
Company, subject to the conditions that (i) the Acquiror shall have agreed in
writing to indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes incurred
by any Subsidiary as a result of any such restructuring in the event that the
Merger is not consummated and (ii) the restructuring takes place before ARPT
makes the distribution described in Section 6.13(c).

 

 

6.14 Notice of Certain Events

 

 

(a) The Company shall notify Acquiror promptly of (i) any written
communication and, to the knowledge of the Company, any other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or another Person)
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (iii) any
material Actions threatened or commenced against or otherwise affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are related to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement or (iv) any effect, event, development or change
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is
reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or
7.02(b) not to be satisfied.

 

 

(b) Acquiror and Merger Subsidiary shall notify the Company promptly of (i)
any written communication and, to the knowledge of Acquiror, any other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Acquiror or
Merger Subsidiary), (ii) any communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the
response thereto from Acquiror or Merger Subsidiary), (iii) any material
Actions threatened or commenced against or otherwise affecting Acquiror or
Merger Subsidiary that are related to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement or (iv) any effect, event, development or change between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) not to be
satisfied.

 

 

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.

 

 

6.15 Qualification of the Company as a Partnership for Tax Purposes

 

 

(a) Within ten (10) business days after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide to the designated tax advisors of the Acquiror (the "Tax
Advisors") all information

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

that is reasonably available with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
requested by the Tax Advisors that is reasonably necessary for the Tax
Advisors to confirm to the Acquiror the accuracy of the representation and
warranty of the Company set forth in Section 5.02(n)(iv), which information
shall include, but is not limited to, tax returns, financial accounting
records, work papers, and other relevant records for all relevant periods. The
Company shall also provide the Tax Advisors reasonable access to any employees
of the Company who might reasonably be expected to have information relevant
to the Tax Advisors' inquiries concerning the Company's qualification as a
partnership for tax purposes. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall make P. Anthony Brown reasonably available to the Tax
Advisors to answer any and all questions that the Tax Advisors may have with
respect to any matters relevant to the Tax Advisors' inquiries, and the
Company hereby consents to Ernst and Young LLP and Hogan and Hartson LLP providing
to the Tax Advisors any and all information that they may have obtained in the
course of their representation of the Company that such Tax Advisors, Ernst and
Young LLP, or Hogan and Hartson LLP may consider relevant or useful to such
inquiry. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, P. Anthony
Brown and Ernst and Young LLP, in its capacity as tax advisor to the Company,
shall not be required to provide any conclusions or other assurances to the
Acquiror or the Tax Advisors regarding the representation and warranty of the
Company set forth in Section 5.02(n)(iv). Tax Advisors shall prepare and
deliver to the Company a detailed request list ("PTP Due Diligence Request")
upon the signing of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) The Acquiror shall cause the Tax Advisors to complete the due diligence
process described in this Section 6.15 within fifteen (15) business days after
the Tax Advisors have received all information described in the PTP Due
Diligence Request. In the event that the Acquiror shall notify the Company in
writing that the Tax Advisors have determined that, in their judgment, there
is a "substantial risk" (which shall represent a greater than twenty five
percent (25%) possibility) that the Company has not qualified to be taxed as a
"partnership" under the Code for any taxable period commencing with the
Company's taxable year ended December 31, 1998 through and including the
taxable year of the Company ending on the Effective Time, which notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail the technical issue (the "Substantial Tax
Issue") for such conclusion (which issue may include a conclusion that there
is not available adequate information for the Company to meet its burden of
proof to demonstrate that it is entitled to be taxed as a "partnership" under
the Code if the IRS should challenge that status), the Company shall
immediately be deemed to be in breach of the representation and warranty set
forth in Section 5.02(n)(iv) for all purposes under this Agreement. The
Company shall have the right to cure such breach by, within ten (10) business
days of the receipt of such notice to the Company, by delivering to the
Acquiror a tax opinion of Hunton and Williams LLP, or other counsel to the
Company satisfactory to the Acquiror, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Acquiror, opining that the Substantial Tax Issue should not have caused the
Company to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation under the
Code for all taxable periods commencing with the Company's taxable year ended
December 31, 1998 through and including the taxable year of the Company in
which such opinion is being rendered (the "PTP Opinion") (if the conclusion
relates to the lack of adequate information as described

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

in the immediately preceding sentence above, an opinion that the available
information should permit the Company to meet such burden of proof).

(a) by the mutual written consent of Acquiror and the Company;

 

 

(b) by either the Company or the Acquiror upon written notice to the other
party, if:

 

 

(i) any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have
issued a governmental order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting either of the Merger, and such governmental order shall have
become final and unappealable; provided, however, that the terms of this

(ii) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before March 31, 2010

the party seeking to terminate the Agreement pursuant to the terms of this
Section 8.01(b)(ii);

 

 

(iii) upon a vote at a duly held Company Shareholders Meeting (or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof) to obtain the Company Shareholder

Approval is not obtained;

 

 

(c) by Acquiror, upon written notice to the Company, if:

 

 

(i) the Company Board or the Company Special Committee (A) makes a

to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or

 

 

(ii) the Company shall have breached any of its representations or warranties
or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to or
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a), 7.02(b) or 7.02(f)
not to be satisfied and (B) is incapable of being cured by the

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

Company by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the Company by
the Outside Date, the Company does not commence to cure such breach or failure
within ten Business Days after its receipt of written notice thereof from
Acquiror and diligently pursue such cure to completion thereafter; provided,
however, that the Acquiror is not then in material breach of this Agreement
so as to cause any of the conditions in Section 7.01, 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) not
to be satisfied;

 

 

(d) by the Company, upon written notice to Acquiror:

 

 

(i) if Acquiror shall have breached any of its representations or warranties
or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to or
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) not to be
satisfied and (B) is incapable of being cured by Acquiror by the Outside Date
or, if capable of being cured by Acquiror by the Outside Date, Acquiror does
not commence to cure such breach or failure within ten Business Days after its

satisfied; or

 

 

(ii) prior to receipt of the Special Shareholder Approval, in accordance with,
and subject to, the terms and conditions of, Section 6.04(a)(vii); provided,
however, that such termination shall not be effective until such time as
payment of the Termination Fee and the Termination Expenses required by

the Company's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(d)(ii)
shall not be available if the Company is then in breach of Section 6.04.

collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts
at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The
Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts
were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Company's
right to receive payment of the Acquiror

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

Termination Fee and the Company Expenses from Acquiror pursuant to this

payment of such amounts, none of Acquiror, Merger Subsidiary or any of their
respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
