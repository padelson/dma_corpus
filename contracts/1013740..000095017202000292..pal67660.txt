13, 2001, Part I of Schedule  2.1(a)(ii), and, on or before January 3, 2002,
Part II of Schedule  2.1(a)(ii), which Schedule shall set forth a list of
equipment leases  which in the good faith judgment of Exodus constitute
Financing Leases  pursuant to which Exodus or another Seller leases equipment
used in the  Business. Part I of Schedule 2.1(a)(ii), when delivered, will
specify  Financing Leases relating to equipment as to which there were at
least  $115,000,000 in aggregate remaining capital lease obligations as of 
September 30, 2001 (the "Primary Scheduled Financing Leases") and Part  II of
Schedule 2.1(a)(ii), when delivered, will specify Financing Leases  relating

Order and this Agreement,  including Part I or Part II of Schedule
2.1(a)(ii), as applicable, shall  be served by Exodus promptly after each
Part is delivered to Parent, on  each counterparty to each Financing Lease

and the  location (by Internet data center or office, as the case may be) of
each  such item of equipment currently in use or operation by the Sellers
or  any of their customers. Exodus shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to include in Part II of such Schedule the location of each such

notify Exodus, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, of  the
equipment listed in Part I or Part II of Schedule 2.1(a)(ii), as the  case
may be, which the Buyer elects to acquire and, promptly after  receipt of
such notice, Exodus shall provide notice of Buyer\'s election  by overnight
mail or facsimile to each relevant counterparty. Such  equipment, and not the
underlying lease, shall thereafter constitute  Purchased Assets for all
purposes of this Agreement. There shall be no  adjustment to the Cash

$50,000,000, in which event  the Cash Consideration shall be increased by an
amount equal to such  excess (which excess, or applicable portion thereof,
shall be paid at  the Closing and/or the Subsequent Transfer as appropriate
to reflect the  equipment transferred at the Closing and/or the Subsequent
Transfer). In  the event that it is determined that a Scheduled Financing
Lease  relating to equipment selected by Parent or the Buyer pursuant to
this  Section 2.1(a)(ii) constitutes a Non-Conforming Lease, Parent and
Exodus  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such equipment
with  alternative equipment (whether owned by the Sellers or subject to 
another Scheduled Financing Lease); provided that such equipment must be 
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Buyer.   (iii) Exodus shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to  deliver to Parent, on or before December
13, 2001, Part I of Schedule  2.1(a)(iii) and, on or before January 3, 2002,

leases with aggregate lease payments remaining after September 30, 2001  of
at least $25,700,000 (when combined with equipment leases set forth  on Part
I of Schedule 2.1(a)(iii)) (the "Secondary Scheduled Operating  Leases" and,
together with the Primary Scheduled Operating Leases, the  "Scheduled
Operating Leases"). Appropriate notice of the Sale and  Motions, along with a
copy of the Bidding Procedures Order and this  Agreement, including Part I or
Part II of Schedule 2.1(a)(iii), as  applicable, shall be served on each
counterparty to each Scheduled  Operating Lease listed in each such Part.
Part I and Part II of Schedule  2.1(a)(iii), when delivered, will, with
respect to each Scheduled  Operating Lease listed therein, specify in
reasonable detail, each  supplement or amendment related thereto, and the
individual items of  leased equipment and lessors covered thereby, and such
other identifying  information required to provide adequate notice to the
counterparties as  required by the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules, and
the location  (by Internet data center or office, as the case may be) of each
such  item of leased equipment currently in use or operation by the Sellers
or  any of their customers, as well as (y) Exodus\'s good faith estimate of 
the amounts necessary to "cure" (within the meaning of Section 365(b)(1)  of
the Bankruptcy Code) any "defaults" (within the meaning of Section  365(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code) applicable to any such Scheduled  Operating Lease and
any supplement, purchase order, schedule, appendix  or amendment thereto that
constitutes a separate executory contract for  purposes of Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code (the cure amount so  specified with respect to any Scheduled
Operating Lease or any  supplement, purchase order, schedule, appendix or
amendment thereto, the  "Agreed Operating Lease Cure Amount"). Exodus shall
use commercially  reasonable efforts to include in Part II of such Schedule
the location  of each such item of equipment that is not currently in use
or  operation. On or before the seventh Business Day prior to the date of 
the Primary Sale Hearing or the Secondary Sale Hearing, as the case may  be,
Parent and the Buyer will notify Exodus, in accordance with the  terms of
this Agreement, of the equipment leased to the Sellers pursuant  to
particular Scheduled Operating Leases (or associated supplements,  purchase
orders, schedules, appendices or amendments) listed in Part I  of Schedule
2.1(a)(iii) (the "Primary Selected Operating Leases") or  Part II of Schedule
2.1(a)(iii) (the "Secondary Selected Operating  Leases" and, together with
the Primary Selected Operating Leases, the  "Selected Operating Leases")
which Parent and the Buyer elect (x) to  have the Sellers assume and assign
to the Buyer or its Designee pursuant  to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
or (y) if not capable of being  assumed and assigned pursuant to clause (x)
for any reason, to have the  Sellers assign to the Buyer or its Designee as
required by, and in the  manner set forth in, Section 7.3(f). Promptly after
receipt of such  election, Exodus shall provide notice of Buyer\'s election
by overnight  mail or facsimile to the relevant lessors.   (iv) To the
extent Parent or the Buyer has consented to the  rejection by any Seller of a
Scheduled Financing Lease or a Scheduled  Operating Lease pursuant to Section

deliver to Exodus a statement (the "Closing Receivables Statement") of the
Accounts Receivable Value as of the Closing Date. The Closing Receivables
Statement shall be prepared by Parent in good faith based on the methods,
principles, practices and policies set out in Schedule 2.2(b)(i) (without
regard to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).   (ii) Concurrently with the delivery of the Closing 
Receivables Statement, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Exodus a 
statement (the "Closing Accounts Statement") of the Pre-Paid Accounts  Value
as of the Closing Date. The Closing Accounts Statement shall be  prepared by
Parent in good faith based on the methods, principles,  practices and
policies set out in Schedule 2.2(b)(ii).   (c) After receipt of the Closing
Receivables Statement and the Closing Accounts Statement, Exodus (including
its advisors) shall have fifteen (15) Business Days to review such statements
together with the work papers used in the preparation thereof. Within such
fifteen (15) Business Day period, Exodus shall notify Parent in writing that
either (A) it concurs with the Closing Receivables Statement and the Closing
Accounts Statement or (B) it disagrees with the Closing Receivables Statement
and/or the Closing Accounts Statement, specifying in reasonable detail the
items as to which disagreement exists (the "Closing Disputed Matters"). If no
notice of disagreement is delivered by Exodus, then the Sellers will be
deemed to have consented to the Closing Receivables Statement and the Closing
Accounts Statement. If a notice of disagreement is delivered by Exodus,
Parent and Exodus shall negotiate in good faith to resolve in writing any
Closing Disputed Matters. If Parent and Exodus are unable to reach an
agreement with respect to the Closing Disputed Matters within a period of
thirty (30) days after the receipt by Parent of a notice of disagreement,
then all Closing Disputed Matters as to which written agreement has not been
reached shall be submitted to and reviewed by an accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to both Parent and Exodus (the "Independent Accountant"). The
Independent Accountant shall consider only the Closing Disputed Matters. The
Independent Accountant shall act promptly to resolve all Closing Disputed
Matters and its decision with respect thereto shall be final and binding upon
the parties and shall be made within thirty (30) days after the later of (x)
the engagement of the Independent Accountant and (y) the date of presentation
of all information initially requested thereby. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant in connection with its review and determination of any
Closing Disputed Matters shall be borne in equal shares by Parent and
Exodus.   (d) Once the Closing Receivables Statement and the
Closing Accounts Statement have been finalized in accordance with Sections
2.2(b) and (c) (as so finalized, the "Final Closing Statements"), the Cash
Consideration shall be adjusted as follows: the Cash Consideration shall be
either (w) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Accounts Receivable
Value as set forth in the Final Closing Statements is greater than
$180,599,000, or (x) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the Accounts
Receivable Value as set forth in the Final Closing Statements is less than
$180,599,000, and either (y) increased by the amount, if any, by which the
Pre-Paid Accounts Value as set forth in the Final Closing Statements is
greater than $22,632,000 or (z) decreased by the amount, if any, by which the
Pre-Paid Accounts Value as set forth in the Final Closing Statements is less
than $22,632,000. The Cash Consideration as determined in accordance with
this Section 2.2(d) shall thereafter for all purposes under this Agreement be
the "Final Cash Consideration". The date on which the Final Cash
Consideration is accepted or finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.2(d) is referred to as the "Determination Date". On the fifth
Business Day following the Determination Date, the following payment shall be
made to an account specified by the recipient prior to such date:   (i) if
the Final Cash Consideration is greater than the Cash  Consideration, Parent,
on behalf of itself or as agent for the Buyer,  shall promptly pay to Exodus
an amount in immediately available same day  funds equal to such excess,
together with interest on such amount at an  annual rate equal to the Prime
Rate calculated on a 365-day year (the  "Interest Rate") from the Closing
Date to the date of the payment of  such amount to Exodus; or   (ii) if the
Final Cash Consideration is less than the Cash  Consideration, Exodus shall
promptly pay to Parent, on behalf of itself  or as agent for the Buyer, an
amount in immediately available same day  funds equal to such shortfall,
together with interest on such amount in  cash at the Interest Rate from the
Closing Date to the date of the  payment of such amount to Parent.   (e) To
the extent any payment is required to be made by Exodus pursuant to Section
2.2(d)(ii), Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to withdraw such amount
from the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.   (f)
During the preparation of the Closing Receivables Statement and the Closing
Accounts Statement and the period of any review or dispute within the
contemplation of this Section 2.2, each of the Sellers, Parent and the Buyer
shall (i) provide the others and their authorized representatives (including
their respective accountants) with reasonable access at reasonable times, and
in a manner so as not to interfere in any material respect with normal
business operations, to all relevant books, records, work papers, information
and employees, and (ii) cooperate fully in the preparation, calculation and
review of the Closing Accounts Statement and the Closing Receivables
Statement or the resolution of any dispute relating thereto.   (g) Scheduled
Lease Amount. To the extent it is determined by agreement of Exodus and
Parent or a court of competent jurisdiction that any lease relating to
equipment designated as Purchased Assets pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) does
not constitute a Financing Lease, but instead constitutes a true lease
transferable to a buyer by means of assumption and assignment pursuant to
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (a "Non-Conforming Lease"), unless a
substitution of equipment is effected as contemplated by the last sentence of
Section 2.1(a)(ii), the appropriate Seller will assume and assign such Non-
Conforming Lease to the Buyer or its Designee pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code and, to the extent determined on or before the last day of
the ninth month following the Closing Date, the Cash Consideration shall be
reduced by, and following Closing Parent or the Buyer shall be entitled
withdraw from the Scheduled Lease Amount deposited pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, an amount equal to the sum of (i) the amounts necessary to "cure"
(within the meaning of Section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code) any
"defaults" (within the meaning of Section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code) each
such Non-Conforming Lease and (ii) the net present value, assuming a discount
rate of 5.5% per annum, of all future lease payments pursuant to each such
Non-Conforming Lease (the "Lease Adjustments"). To the extent any
determination that a lease constitutes a Non-Conforming Lease is made on or
prior to the Closing Date, the amount of any Lease Adjustment with respect to
the relevant Non-Conforming Lease shall constitute a "Pre-Closing Lease
Adjustment" and shall be deducted from the Cash Consideration to be paid at
the Closing in accordance with Section 2.2(a); provided, that the Pre-Closing
Lease Adjustments, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $50,000,000. Any Lease
Adjustment with respect to a lease described on Schedule 2.1(a)(iii)
determined not to constitute a Financing Lease after the Closing Date shall
be paid out of the Scheduled Lease Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
and shall be satisfied solely pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement;
provided, that to the extent Parent or the Buyer has not made a claim for
reduction of the Cash Consideration with respect to any portion of the
Scheduled Lease Amount on or prior to last day of the ninth month following
the Closing Date, such unclaimed portion shall be released to Exodus in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   Section 2.3. Contract

pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or (y) the consent of a third

order to affect an assignment thereof the Buyer or its Designee; provided
that the fact that any Scheduled Financing Lease or Scheduled Operating Lease
described in Schedules 2.3(a)(ii) or 2.3(a)(iii) or network Contract
described in Section 2.3(b) contains provisions that would not be severable
absent consent from a counterparty shall not by itself require the Seller to

Contract" and collectively the "Primary 365 Contracts") or (B) if not capable
of being assumed and assigned pursuant to clause (A), to have the Sellers

"Primary Assigned Contracts"). On or before the seventh Business Day prior to
the date of the Secondary Sale Hearing, Parent and the Buyer will notify
Exodus, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, of the Contracts set

respect of such Contract pursuant to Section 2.4(a) are so high relative to
the benefits of such Contract that Parent, if making the decision whether to
assume such Contract, and bear such Actual Cure Amounts, for its own account
would not assume such Contract.   (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.3, no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent may elect not to have the Buyer assume one or more
of the Assigned Contracts, in which case any such Contract shall no longer be
an Assigned Contract (it being understood that there shall be no adjustment
to the Cash Consideration as a result of any such election by Parent).  
(f) Confidentiality. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees (i) that it is
in the best interests of the Sellers, Parent and the Buyer for the lists of,
or any other information regarding, the Scheduled Financing Leases and the

divulged to any other party (specifically excluding the representatives of
any official committee appointed in the Bankruptcy Cases and Persons who have
been identified by the Sellers\' advisors as potential participants in the
auction process, in each case who enter into a customary confidentiality
agreement and their respective advisors and the Bankruptcy Court (the
"Bankruptcy Auction Interested Parties")) prior to the date (the "Notice
Date") on which the counterparties to the Assigned Contracts are given notice
of a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to have the Sellers assign the Assigned
Contracts to the Buyer or their Designees, (ii) not to disclose any Contract
Confidential Information to any third party (other than the Bankruptcy
Auction Interested Parties) including any of the other parties to any of the
Assigned Contracts ("Contract Parties"), (iii) that the Contract Confidential
Information shall be kept confidential from and shall not be disclosed to any
party (other than any Bankruptcy Auction Interested Party) entitled to
receive notice in the Bankruptcy Cases until after the Notice Date, and (iv)
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent and the Buyer may contact any of
the Contract Parties in order to negotiate with such Contract Parties the
possible assignment and, if applicable, assumption of any Assigned Contracts,
provided that Parent and the Buyer shall their use commercially reasonable
efforts to notify and coordinate with Exodus prior to any such
negotiation.   Section 2.4. Contract Obligations.   (a) Except as set
forth in the following sentence, the Sellers, and not Parent or the Buyer,
shall be liable for, and shall satisfy, any and all amounts necessary to
"cure" (within the meaning of Section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code) any
"defaults" (within the meaning of Section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code)
relating to any Primary or Secondary 365 Contract (the full amount thereof
being the "Actual Cure Amounts") and Parent and the Buyer shall have no
responsibility to any third party therefor. The Buyer shall pay to Exodus (i)
the first $2,000,000 in Agreed Operating Lease Cure Amounts with respect to
the Selected Operating Leases validly assigned to the Buyer pursuant to the
Primary 365 Contracts Order or the Secondary 365 Contracts Order relating to
equipment with remaining lease obligations of up to $12,000,000 as of
September 30, 2001 and (ii) all Agreed Operating Lease Cure Amounts with
respect to the Selected Operating Leases validly assigned to the Buyer
pursuant to the Primary 365 Contracts Order or the Secondary 365 Contracts
Order relating to equipment with remaining lease obligations in excess of
$12,000,000 as of such date. To the extent that the Actual Cure Amount with
respect to any particular Selected Operating Lease exceeds the Agreed
Operating Lease Cure Amount specified on Part I or Part II of
Schedule 2.1(a)(iii), the Sellers shall be responsible for the difference, in
each case on a lease by lease basis. All other liabilities, obligations
and indebtedness relating to the Assigned Contracts shall be retained
obligations and liabilities of the Sellers.   (b) The Buyer shall be
obligated to pay any amounts for services rendered and goods provided on and
after the Closing Date under any Assigned Contract validly assigned to the
Buyer or its Designees.   (c) The Sellers are responsible for the
verification of all "cure" (within the meaning of Section 365(b)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code) amounts and all administrative responsibilities associated
therewith, in their Bankruptcy Cases or otherwise, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to establish the proper "cure" (within the meaning of
Section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code) amount, if any, for each Primary
or Secondary 365 Contract, and file and prosecute any and all
appropriate proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court. The Actual Cure Amounts
associated with any Primary or Secondary 365 Contract assigned to the Buyer
or its Designees pursuant to any 365 Contracts Order shall be paid by the
Sellers at or as soon as practicable after determination and, to the extent
Parent or the Buyer satisfies any amount, with respect to any Contract, in
excess of the obligations of such persons under this Section 2.4, such excess
shall be a credit against the Cash Consideration.   Section 2.5. No
Expansion of Third Party Rights. The assumption by the Buyer of the Assumed
Liabilities shall in no way expand the rights or remedies of any third party
against Parent, the Buyer or the Sellers as compared to the rights and
remedies which such third party would have had against the Sellers absent the
Bankruptcy Cases, had the Buyer not assumed such Assumed Liabilities. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the assumption by the
Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities shall not create any third-party beneficiary
rights other than with respect to the Person that is the obligee of such
Assumed Liability.   Section 2.6. Closing. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate,

permits and licenses of Governmental Entities required for the Sellers, the
SPEs and their respective Subsidiaries to conduct the Business have been
obtained, except for any such approvals, permits or licenses the absence of

Contract. Schedule 2.1(a)(ii), Schedule 2.1(a)(iii), Schedule 2.3(a),

creation of any Lien on any Purchased Asset, except, in the case of clauses

to those types and amounts typical of office or Internet data center
environments.   (d) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13(d), There are
no conditions or circumstances arising from or relating to the Purchased
Assets, the activities or operations of the Sellers with respect to the
Purchased Assets, or the activities, operations or assets of the SPEs,
including without limitation, the presence, release or disposal of any

liability of Parent, the Buyer or any Designee for such Tax to the applicable
Taxing Authority;   (b) subject to the entry of the Primary Sale Order and
the Primary Sale Order becoming a Final Order, no material Tax Lien in

Designee for such Tax to the applicable Taxing Authority; and   (c) each of
the SPEs is, and has been since its formation, a partnership or a disregarded

complete and correct list of the following categories of Exodus Owned
Intellectual Property: (i) registered Trademarks; (ii) Patents (including
issued and applications therefor); and (iii) registered Copyrights. Schedule

material Exodus Licensed Intellectual Property (including Software) (other
than non-exclusive licenses of commercial "shrink wrap" software and customer
agreements entered into by any Seller in the ordinary course); and (y) all
agreements under which any Seller has licensed to others the right to use any
material Exodus Intellectual Property (other than customer agreements entered

Exodus Intellectual Property constitutes all of the Intellectual Property
that is material or necessary to the operation of the Business as currently
operated, except for Intellectual Property that the Sellers could discontinue
to use without such a discontinuation having, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Exodus or on the Purchased Assets.
Exodus or another Seller owns sufficient legal rights to use the Exodus
Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of conditions, adverse claims or
other restrictions or any requirement of any past, present or future
royalty payments, and Exodus or another Seller owns, licenses or otherwise
possesses sufficient legal rights to use the Exodus Licensed Intellectual
Property, free and clear of conditions (except as provided in the relevant
license agreement) or to the Knowledge of the Sellers, adverse claims or
other restrictions, except to the extent that the failure to have any such
rights has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Exodus or on the
Purchased Assets;   (c) The Sellers have taken reasonable steps to register
all material Exodus Intellectual Property with the applicable authorities in
all jurisdictions in which the Sellers have a principal place of business,
and all registrations for material Exodus Owned Intellectual Property,
including for Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights, are registered in the name
of one of the Sellers and are subsisting;   (d) Exodus and each other
Seller has secured valid written assignments from all consultants and
employees who contribute or have contributed to the creation or development
of Exodus Owned Intellectual Property of the rights to such contributions
that Exodus or such other Seller does not already own by operation of law

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Exodus or the Purchased Assets;  
(e) Exodus and the Exodus Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all of the material
Trade Secrets that comprise any part of Exodus Intellectual Property (except
where failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Exodus or the Purchased
Assets). To the Knowledge of Exodus, there are no unauthorized uses,
disclosures or infringements of any such material Trade Secrets; all use by,
and disclosure to, any Person of such material Trade Secrets that comprise
any part of Exodus Intellectual Property has been pursuant to the terms of a
written agreement with such Person; and all use by Exodus or any Exodus
Subsidiary of such material Trade Secrets owned by another Person has been
pursuant to the terms of a written agreement with such Person or is otherwise
lawful;   (f) there is no pending (or, to the Knowledge of Exodus or
any other Seller, threatened) assertion or claim and there has been no
such assertion or claim in the last six years: (i) challenging the validity
or enforceability of, or contesting Exodus\'s or the other Sellers\' rights
with respect to, any material Exodus Owned Intellectual Property, (ii)
challenging Exodus\'s or the other Sellers\' rights to use any material
Exodus Licensed Intellectual Property or the validity or enforceability of
the agreement relating thereto (except for claims asserted in the Bankruptcy
Cases), (iii) or asserting that Exodus\'s or any other Sellers\' use or
exploitation of any material Exodus Intellectual Property or its or their
provision of goods and/or services in connection with the Business, infringes
upon, misappropriates, violates or conflicts in any way with the rights of
any third party (including rights in Intellectual Property); and, in each
case, to the Knowledge of Exodus and the other Sellers, there are no
reasonable grounds for any such assertion or claim, except where such
assertion or claim, in each case, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Exodus or the Purchased Assets; neither
Exodus nor any other Seller is a party to any suit, action or proceeding
which involves a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any
Intellectual Property of any third party;   (g) neither Exodus nor any
other Seller has given or received any notice of default or any event which
with the lapse of time would constitute a default under any agreement
relating to any material Exodus Intellectual Property; neither Exodus nor any
other Seller nor, to their Knowledge, any other party, currently is in
default with regard to any agreement relating to any material Exodus
Intellectual Property, and there exists no condition or event (including,
without limitation, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement) which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default by Exodus or any other Seller under any agreement
relating to any material Exodus Intellectual Property, or would give any
person any rights of termination, cancellation, acceleration of
any performance under any such agreement or result in the creation or
imposition of any lien, in each case, except where such default would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on Exodus or the Purchased Assets;   (h) to
Exodus\'s Knowledge, there are no unauthorized uses, disclosures,
infringements, or misappropriations by any third party of any Exodus
Intellectual Property or any material breaches by any third party of any
licenses or agreements involving Exodus Intellectual Property, except where
such actions would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Exodus or on the Purchased Assets; and   (i) Exodus and
each other Seller has obtained any and all necessary consents from customers
of the Business with regard to Exodus\'s and each Exodus Subsidiary\'s, as
the case may be, collection and dissemination of personal information of such
Customers in accordance with any applicable privacy policy published or
otherwise communicated by Exodus or any other Seller and to Exodus\'s
Knowledge any applicable Laws. Exodus\'s and each other Seller\'s practices
regarding the collection and use of personal customer information are and
have been in accordance with such privacy policies in all material respects
and to Exodus\'s Knowledge, with all applicable Laws.   Section 3.16. Labor
Matters.   (a) None of the SPEs or any Seller is a party to any labor
or collective bargaining agreement with respect to any Business Employees;
no Business Employees are represented by any labor organization; to
the Knowledge of any Seller, no labor organization or Business Employee has
made a pending demand for recognition or request for certification to the
SPEs or any Seller; and there are no representation or certification

SPEs or any Seller of any Business Employee.   (e) The SPEs and the Sellers
are in material compliance with all Laws relating to the employment of labor,
independent contractors and "leased employees" (within the meaning of Section

collective bargaining, discrimination (including, but not limited to, based
upon age, sex, marital status, race, national origin, disability or veteran
status), civil rights, safety and health, workers\' compensation and the
collection and payment of withholding and/or Social Security Taxes and

Sellers and/or the SPEs, as the case may be, have the right to terminate such
employees\' employment, and such employees have the right to resign their
employment, at any time, without reason or cause. Schedule 3.16(g) lists all
written (and includes a summary of all legally binding oral) employment and
consulting agreements to which any Business Employee is a party or by which
such employee is bound. Complete and correct copies of the agreements
or arrangements listed and summarized on Schedule 3.16(g) have been provided
or made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.   (h) The employment
by Parent, the Buyer or the SPEs of the Business Employees following the
Closing Date, as contemplated in Section 6.15, does not and will not conflict
with, breach, violate or cause a default under any Contract or Judgment,
including without limitation any non-competition or non-solicitation
agreements, to which any Seller or the SPEs are a party or by which they are
bound.   (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16(i), there are
no liabilities, whether absolute or contingent, of the Sellers and any of

Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.  
(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17(d), none of the SPEs or any Seller
is, or was during the preceding six years, obligated to contribute to, or
contributes to, any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA.   (e) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.17(e), none of the SPEs
or any Seller has any liability (contingent or otherwise) or potential
liability to any entity arising under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code.   (f) The Benefit Plans and their related trusts that are intended to
qualify under Sections 401 and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, or similar
provisions under applicable Law, have been determined to, or will be timely
submitted to the IRS or the applicable Governmental Entity for
a determination that such Benefit Plans do, qualify under such Sections,
as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, or provisions and, to the Knowledge
of the Sellers, nothing has occurred since the time of such
favorable determination that might cause the loss of such qualified
status.   (g) All contributions required to have been made by the
Sellers or the SPEs under any Benefit Plan or any Law to any trusts
established thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due
date therefor (including any valid extensions).   (h) Except as set forth

furnishing of such documents to participants and beneficiaries in the Benefit
Plans. To the Knowledge of Sellers, there has been no "prohibited
transaction" (including without limitation as a result of any of the

respect to such plan (other than benefit claims in the ordinary course).  
(j) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.17(j) hereto, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will (i) increase any
benefits or the amount of compensation to any Business Employee or (ii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any
such compensation or benefits. In addition, except as disclosed and described
in Schedule 3.17(j) hereto, no Benefit Plan or agreement, program, policy or
other arrangement by or to which the SPEs or the Sellers are a party, is
bound or is otherwise liable, by its terms or in effect would or could
possibly require any payment or transfer of money, property or
other consideration on account of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
Business Employee (whether or not any such payment would constitute a
"parachute payment" or "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code).   (k) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.17(k)
hereto and as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of

active, inactive, leave of absence, short or long-term disability, etc.)  
(m) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit plan that
will be assumed by Parent, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates, as of the
Closing Date, the actuarially determined present value of all
benefit liabilities, determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
contained in the applicable Benefit Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation,
do not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Benefit Plan or,
with respect to any foreign plan not subject to any funding requirement, if
such liabilities do exceed such assets, the amount thereof was properly
reflected on the financial statements of the SPE being acquired by Parent or
the Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.  
Section 3.18. Insurance. Schedule 3.18 hereto lists the insurance policies
(including the premiums payable in connection therewith and the amount of the
coverage provided thereunder) maintained by Exodus and the Exodus
Subsidiaries which policies provide coverage for the business of Exodus and

effect and none of Exodus or any of the Exodus Subsidiaries is in material
default of any provision thereof.   Section 3.19. Brokers and Finders.
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.19, no broker, finder, consultant or

Operating Leases, and the Scheduled Contracts will include all assets,
property, rights, Contracts and systems of Exodus and its Subsidiaries
necessary to operate the Business as it is currently being operated, in each
case except to the extent Parent has elected, or will elect pursuant hereto,
not to acquire such assets, property, rights, Contracts or systems or to the
extent provided in the Transition Services Agreement S/B.   ARTICLE IV

performed by it and the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly taken, and no other corporate proceedings or
actions on the part of Parent or the Buyer are necessary. This Agreement is,

Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   Section 4.3. Brokers and Finders. No
broker, finder, consultant or intermediary is entitled to a broker\'s,
finder\'s or similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or upon the consummation of the transactions

or commissions payable, unless reimbursed pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof,
solely by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.4. Consents and
Approvals. Other than approvals required under the HSR Act, any non-U.S. laws
regulating competition, antitrust, investment or exchange controls, the

consummation by Parent and the Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not: (a) violate any provision of Parent\'s or the Buyer\'s constituent
documents; (b) violate any Law applicable to Parent or the Buyer; (c) require
Parent or the Buyer to make any filing with, obtain any permit, consent,

V   TAX MATTERS   Section 5.1. Transfer Taxes. (a) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, to the extent not exempt under section
1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, the Sellers shall bear and be
responsible for any sales, use, transfer, ad valorem, gross receipts, value-
added, stamp, documentary and other similar non-net income Taxes which may be
imposed or assessed as a result of Sellers\' transfers of the Purchased
Assets to the Buyer or Designee, including the stock or interests in the
SPEs, if any (all such taxes, "Transfer Taxes"). At any Seller\'s request,
the Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good
faith with Sellers to minimize Transfer Taxes, if any, including obtaining
any certificate of exemption or similar document in respect of Transfer
Taxes, if any. The Sellers shall prepare and file all Transfer Tax Returns
with respect to Transfer Taxes, if any. Sellers shall promptly forward a copy
of any such filed Transfer Tax Returns to Parent, and Parent, Buyer and their
Affiliates shall not take any action with respect to Transfer Taxes, on any
Tax Return or otherwise, that is inconsistent with any such Transfer Tax
Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not affect
the rights of Parent, Buyer and any of their Affiliates to take any action,
on any Tax Return or otherwise, with respect to Taxes other than Transfer
Taxes.   (b) Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Buyer in its efforts, if requested by a Seller pursuant to
Section 5.1(a), to minimize Transfer Taxes, if any, including efforts to
obtain any exemption certificates or similar documents.   Section 5.2.
Allocation of Purchase Price. Alpha may, at its election, deliver to Parent a
proposed allocation of the Cash Consideration and other relevant items (the
"Proposed Allocation") among the assets acquired or deemed to be acquired
with respect to the purchase of the Primary Purchased Assets. If after ten
(10) Business Days after the delivery of such Proposed Allocation to Parent,
Parent does not notify Alpha in writing of its disagreement with the Proposed
Allocation, such Allocation shall be the final allocation (the "Final
Allocation"). If Parent notifies Alpha in writing that it disagrees with any
aspect of the Proposed Allocation within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of the Proposed Allocation, Parent and Alpha shall attempt in good
faith to agree to an allocation within five (5) Business Days after such
notification. If Parent and Alpha agree upon an allocation, then such
allocation shall be the Final Allocation. Only the Final Allocation
determined under this Section 5.2, if there is one, shall be final and
binding as among the Sellers, Parent, the Buyer and their respective
Affiliates and none of the Sellers, Parent, the Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof shall take any position on any Tax Return, including, without
limitation, IRS Form 8594, that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation. If
a Subsequent Transfer takes place, then any additional Cash Consideration and
other relevant items shall be allocated to the Secondary Purchased Assets in
a manner that is consistent with the Final Allocation.   Section 5.3. Tax
Information. The Buyer and the Sellers shall promptly provide each other with
any reasonably requested information for purposes of determining any Tax
liability in respect of any Purchased Asset, and shall otherwise make
available to each other all information, records or documents relating to Tax
liabilities in respect of the Purchased Assets. The Buyer and Sellers shall
preserve all such information, records and documents until the expiration of
any statute of limitations or extensions thereof.   ARTICLE VI   CERTAIN

Parent.   (ii) Sale Orders and 365 Orders. As promptly as possible,  but in
no event later than the dates set forth below, Exodus, and if  appropriate,

Sale Motion" and a "Primary Sale  Order", respectively, and any such motion
and order with respect to  the Primary Assigned Contracts, a "Primary 365

Affiliates (including any Designee), or the business of  the Sellers or their
Affiliates (including any Designee), or under any  such Contract, other than

Agreement, and (iii) constitute  transfers for reasonably equivalent value
and fair consideration;   2) all amounts to be paid by any Seller to Parent

this Agreement;   13) provides that neither the Buyer nor its Affiliates

as a result of the Sellers\'  assumption or assignment to the Buyer or its
Designees of the Assigned  Contracts, and that the validity of such
assumption or assignment shall  not be affected by any dispute between the
Sellers or any of their  Affiliates and any counterparty to any Assigned
Contract; and   19) provides that the Assigned Contracts, upon assignment

Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code to transfer to the Buyer or its
Designees the equipment (and not the underlying leases) subject to the

and the Secondary Sale Motion shall also request, in the alternative,
authorization pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code to assume and
assign the Primary Scheduled Financing Leases and the Secondary Scheduled
Financing Leases, respectively, if it is determined that any Primary
Scheduled Financing Lease or Secondary Scheduled Financing Lease constitutes
a Non-Conforming Lease. In that event, the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Bankruptcy Court to enter such an order which
contains, among other provisions reasonably requested by Parent, provisions
consistent with those set forth in Section 6.1(a)(ii). For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b) shall survive the Closing.  
(c) If any Order or any other order of the Bankruptcy Court relating to this

motion for rehearing, reargument or stay shall be filed with respect
thereto), the Sellers agree to, and to cause their Affiliates to, take all
commercially reasonable steps, and use commercially reasonable efforts, to
defend against such appeal, petition or motion, and Parent and the Buyer
agree to cooperate in such efforts. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an expedited resolution of
such appeal; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the
parties hereto from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby if any
Order shall have been entered and have not been stayed and Parent, in its
reasonable judgment, has waived in writing the requirement that such Order be
a Final Order, in which event the Buyer and its Designees shall be able to
assert the benefits of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and, as a
consequence of which, such appeal shall become moot.   Section 6.2.
Consultation; Notification; No Conflict. The Sellers shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, (a) consult with Parent, prior to their submission to
the Bankruptcy Court, on the form and substance of the Bidding Procedures
Order, the Orders, the Motions and all court submissions by any of the
Sellers relating to this Agreement, and (b) promptly deliver to Parent copies
of any and all pleadings, motions, notices, statements, schedules,
applications, reports, proposed orders and other documents filed by the
Sellers or related to the Bankruptcy Cases, including, but not limited to,
any objections to this Agreement, any of the pleadings filed with
the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement, or the

further covenant and agree that, to the extent this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the
terms of any plan of reorganization or liquidation submitted by the Sellers
or their Affiliates to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation shall not
conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify, modify or restrict the terms of
this Agreement and the rights of Parent, the Buyer or their Affiliates
hereunder, or in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or
performance of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, any transaction that is contemplated by or approved pursuant to
the Bidding Procedures Order or any Order.   Section 6.3. Bidding
Procedures. The Sellers acknowledge that this Agreement is the culmination of
an extensive process undertaken by the Sellers to identify and negotiate a
transaction with a bidder prepared to pay the highest or otherwise best
purchase price for the Purchased Assets while assuming or otherwise
satisfying certain liabilities in order to maximize the value for the Sellers
and their estates. Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures") to be employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the
sale of the Purchased Assets of the Sellers to the Buyer (the "Sale"). The
Sale is subject to competitive bidding only as set forth herein and approval
by the Bankruptcy Court at the Primary Sale Hearing of the Primary Sale
Order. There shall be no competitive bidding in connection with the Secondary
Sale Hearing. The following overbid provisions and related bid protections
are designed to compensate Parent and the Buyer for their efforts and
agreements to date and to facilitate a full and fair process designed to
maximize the value of the Purchased Assets for the benefit of the Sellers\'
and their Subsidiaries\' creditors and stakeholders.   (a) Bid Deadline. All
Bids must be submitted to Exodus, 2831 Mission College Boulevard, Santa
Clara, California 95054 Attention: Bill Austin, Chief Financial Officer, with

of its fiduciary duty and after consultation with its advisers, has
determined is financially able to consummate the purchase, either jointly or
separately, of the Purchased Assets (a "Qualified Bidder") stating that (A)
such Qualified Bidder offers to purchase the Purchased Assets upon the terms
and conditions set forth in a copy of this Agreement, together with all
Exhibits and Schedules hereto (the "Definitive Sale Documentation"), marked
to show those amendments and modifications to the Definitive Sale
Documentation, including, but not limited to, the price and time of closing,
that such Qualified Bidder proposes, (B) such Qualified Bidder is prepared to
enter into and consummate the transaction within not more than fifteen (15)
days after the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court approving any
Alternative Transaction, subject to receipt of any governmental or regulatory
approvals (which must be obtained within sixty (60) days after entry of such
order), and (C) such Qualified Bidder\'s offer is irrevocable until the
closing of its purchase of the Purchased Assets. For purposes of determining
the existence of a Bid, a Bid may be in the form of a joint bid from more
than one Person.   (b) Qualified Bid. Only Qualified Bids will qualify
for consideration at the Auction (as defined below). For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Qualified Bid" is a Bid that:   (i) complies in all
respects with Section 6.3(a);   (ii) has a cash component of at least an
amount sufficient  to satisfy 100% of the Break-Up Fee;   (iii) is a
proposal that Exodus determines in the good faith  opinion of the Board of
Directors of Exodus after consultation with the  independent financial
advisors of Exodus and the Committee has a value,  taking into account the
burdens and conditions associated with such  proposal, greater than or equal
to the sum of (x) the value, as  reasonably determined by the independent
financial advisors of Exodus,  of the Buyer\'s offer plus (y) the amount of
the Break-Up Fee plus (z) in  the case of the initial Qualified Bid,
$10,000,000, and in the case of  any subsequent Qualified Bids, $1,000,000
over the preceding Qualified  Bid;   (iv) is accompanied by satisfactory
evidence of committed  financing or other ability to perform;   (v) is

within not more than 15 days after entry of an  order by the Bankruptcy Court
approving such purchase, subject to the  receipt of any governmental or
regulatory approvals which must be  obtained within 60 days after entry of
such order.  If the Sellers do not receive any Qualified Bids other than
this Agreement, the Sellers will report the same to the Bankruptcy Court and
will proceed with the Sale pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. For
purposes of the Auction, Parent and the Buyer shall constitute Qualified
Bidders, and this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, shall
constitute a Qualified Bid, for all purposes.   (c) Auction, Bidding
Increments, and Bids Remaining Open.   (i) If the Sellers receives at least
one Qualified Bid in  addition to this Agreement, the Sellers will conduct an
auction (the  "Auction") at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP,  Four Times Square, New York, New York 10036, on the date that is
three  (3) Business Day prior to the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court
for  the Primary Sale Hearing, beginning at 11:00 A.M. (EST) or such later 
time or other place as Exodus shall notify all Qualified Bidders who  have
submitted Qualified Bids. Only Exodus, Parent, the Buyer, any  representative
of the Committee and any representative of General  Electric Capital
Corporation, as lead arranger under the DIP Financing  (and the legal and
financial advisers to each of the foregoing), and any  Qualified Bidder who
has timely submitted a Qualified Bid shall be  entitled to attend the
Auction, and only Parent, the Buyer and Qualified  Bidders will be entitled
to make any subsequent Qualified Bids at the  Auction. At the Auction,
bidding shall begin initially with the highest  or otherwise best Qualified

until such time as the highest or  otherwise best Qualified Bid is
determined. Immediately upon selection  of the highest or otherwise best
Qualified Bid, such Qualified Bidder  shall pay (by means of a certified bank
check from a U.S. bank or by  wire transfer) pay an additional deposit equal
to (A) 100% of the  Break-Up Fee minus (B) the amount of such Qualified
Bidder\'s initial  deposit under Section 6.3(b)(v) hereto, to be held in
escrow by the  Escrow Agent until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of  the Qualified Bid. Exodus may announce at the Auction
additional  procedural rules that are reasonable under the circumstances
(e.g., the  amount of time allotted to make subsequent overbids) for
conducting the  Auction so long as such rules are not inconsistent with these
Bidding  Procedures.   (ii) At least one Business Day prior to the Auction,
Exodus  will give Parent, the Buyer, counsel to the Committee, counsel to 
General Electric Capital Corporation and all other Qualified Bidders a  copy
of the highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid and copies of all  other
Qualified Bids. In addition, Exodus will inform Parent and each  other
Qualified Bidder who has expressed its intent to participate in  the Auction
of the identity of all Qualified Bidders that may  participate in the
Auction.   Section 6.4. Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee. (a)
Exodus hereby agrees, in the event that any Seller (i) accepts a Bid, other
than that of the Buyer, as the highest or otherwise best offer (an
"Auction Transaction") or (ii) sells, transfers, leases or otherwise
disposes, directly or indirectly, including through an asset sale, stock
sale, merger, reorganization or other similar transaction (by the Sellers or
their Affiliates or otherwise), all or a substantial portion of the
Purchased Assets (or agrees to do any of the foregoing) in a transaction or
series of transactions to a party or parties other than the Buyer or its
Designees within six (6) months from the date hereof (any of clause (i) or
(ii) being, an "Alternative Transaction"), to pay to Parent a break-up fee
(the "Break-Up Fee") in the amount of $16,800,000 which reimburses Parent and
the Buyer for their expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compensates Parent and the Buyer for the
time and expense dedicated to this transaction and the value added by Parent
and the Buyer in (A) establishing a bid standard or minimum for other
bidders, (B) placing the Sellers\' estate property in a sales configuration
mode attracting other bidders to the Auction and (C) for serving, by its name
and its expressed interest, as a catalyst for other potential or actual
bidders. The Break-Up Fee shall constitute an administrative priority claim
against the Sellers\' estates under Sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code and shall be paid immediately, without further order of the
Bankruptcy Court, upon the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of an order
approving an Alternative Transaction.   (b) Exodus hereby agrees, in the
event that (i) the Sellers withdraw or determine not to prosecute the Sale
Motion, or (ii) a plan of reorganization or liquidation is filed by any of
the Sellers or the Committee with the Bankruptcy Court which, if approved by
the Bankruptcy Court, would be inconsistent with the transfer and assignment
of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer or its Designees as contemplated by this
Agreement, to pay to Parent an amount equal to the actual out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of counsel, expenses of
financial advisors and expenses of other consultants and the HSR Act filing
fee) incurred by Parent and the Buyer in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, but in no event more than $5,000,000
(the "Expense Reimbursement"); provided, however, that in no event shall
the Expense Reimbursement be payable to Parent (x) if Parent or the
Buyer terminate this Agreement (other than in the event of an Auction
Transaction) for any reason other than the willful breach by Exodus of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
or (y) if this Agreement is terminated by Exodus pursuant to Sections 8.1(c)
or (k). The Expense Reimbursement shall constitute an administrative priority
claim against Sellers\' estates under Sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of
the Bankruptcy Code and shall be paid immediately, without further order of
the Bankruptcy Court, upon occurrence of the earlier of either of the
events referred to in clause (i) or upon entry by the Bankruptcy Court of an
order approving the plan referred to in clause (ii) of this Section
6.4(b).   Section 6.5. Other Assets and Agreements. Upon the discovery
by any Seller or any of its Affiliates of any item included within
the definition of Purchased Assets but not transferred, conveyed or assigned
to the Buyer or any Designee, such Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (a) deliver written notice to Parent of the existence and non-
transfer, non-conveyance or non-assumption of such item and provide Parent
with all the information about and with access to such item as Parent may
reasonably request, and (b) if requested by Parent, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer, convey or assign to the Buyer or its Designee
(as specified by Parent) such item in the manner and on the terms and
conditions as if it were a Purchased Asset under this Agreement, subject to
applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the Closing.   Section
6.6. Additional Matters and Further Assurances. (a) To the extent that, under
applicable Law, any Assigned Contract (or any Seller\'s rights thereunder)
may not be assigned to the Buyer or its Designee or transferred without the
consent of a third party and such consent has not been obtained, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer such
Assigned Contract if an attempted assignment or transfer would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful, and the Sellers shall:   (i) use their
commercially reasonable efforts to procure  such consent and an assignment or
a novation of such Assigned Contract;   (ii) if they are unable to procure
such consent and  assignment or novation of such Assigned Contract, use their
commercially  reasonable efforts to establish a reasonable arrangement
designed to  provide the benefits and burdens of such Assigned Contract to
the Buyer  or its Designee, including by sublicense, sublease, subcontract,
escrow  or similar arrangement at no additional charge or obligation to the 
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Designee); and   (iii) remit
any rents, revenues, security deposits or any  other dollar amounts, notices
or documents received by any Seller or its  Subsidiaries in connection with
such Assigned Contract to the Buyer or  its Designee within five (5) Business
Days of its receipt thereof,  provided that the Buyer or Designee to whom
such Contract was to be  assigned shall be responsible all obligations
arising under such  Assigned Contract after the Closing Date.   (b) For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this  Section 6.6 shall survive the
Closing.   Section 6.7. Access and Information. (a) The Sellers
shall permit, and shall cause the other Exodus Subsidiaries to permit,
Parent, the Buyer and their representatives after the date of execution of
this Agreement to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and

and documents and other information that is available with respect to Exodus,
the Exodus Subsidiaries and the Purchased Assets as Parent and the Buyer
shall from time to time reasonably request (including any work papers of the
Sellers\' accountants); provided, that the foregoing shall not require the
Sellers to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in its
reasonable judgment would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate the Sellers\' or the SPEs\' obligations with respect
to confidentiality.   (b) Exodus shall provide Parent with copies of (i) all
reports, appraisals, statements and other documents and information provided
to the lenders or any agent therefor under the DIP Financing (including any
reports on working capital) on the same date such materials are delivered to
such Persons and (ii) copies of any filing, statement, document or
other information or material Exodus or any of its Subsidiaries files

the customers associated with each such piece of equipment.   (e) All
information provided or obtained pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above shall
be held by the Buyer in accordance with and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 21, 2001 (the "Confidentiality

respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable all consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations required by
Section 7.3(f) and under the items set forth on Schedule 7.3(g) hereto.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this

their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell,

under the Transition Services Agreement B/S and the Transition Services
Agreement S/B ("Permitted Activities")).   (b) From and after the Closing,
none of the Sellers or any of their Retained Subsidiaries shall have any
right, title or interest in or to any of the Exodus Intellectual Property
included in the Purchased Assets, including, without limitation, any right to
directly or indirectly use, license, sublicense, sell, lease, transfer,

and shall cause their Subsidiaries to not, take any action or permit any
action to be taken that is inconsistent with the foregoing sentence,

comprised within any Excluded Asset, prior to the Closing the Sellers shall,
and shall cause their Subsidiaries to cease Use of any Exodus Intellectual
Property, except as may otherwise be contemplated by or required in
connection with the Transition Services S/B, the Transition Services B/S and

Sellers, each of Parent, the Buyer and the SPEs shall be entitled, if it so
elects, to institute and prosecute proceedings in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either in law or in equity, to obtain damages for any breach of
this Section 6.13, to enforce the specific performance thereof by the Sellers
and their Affiliates and/or to enjoin the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates from actions in violation of this Section 6.13.   Section 6.14.
Closing. Subject to the last sentence of Section 6.8(a), the parties agree to
use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article VII so as to enable the parties to
effect the Closing on or prior to the date set forth in Section 8.1(b).  
Section 6.15. Employment. Prior to the Closing Date (to be effective on the
Closing Date), Parent or the Buyer will offer regular full-time or part-time
employment, as applicable, to such full-time employees and part-time
employees, respectively, of the Sellers as Parent shall hereafter designate
to the Sellers (collectively, the "Business Employees"). Employees who accept
offers of employment made by Parent or the Buyer pursuant to this Section
6.15 shall be referred to herein as the "Transferred Employees", provided,
however, that any Business Employee who is not actively at work on the
Closing Date on account of sickness, vacation or short-term disability shall
be deemed a "Transferred Employee" upon his or her return to active
employment with Parent, the Buyer, a Designee or any of the
Acquired Companies after the Closing Date. Nothing in Section 6.15 shall be
deemed to require, however, that the employment of any Transferred Employee
be continued for any specific period of time after the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall be responsible for and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Parent, the Buyer and their Affiliates from any liabilities relating
to any current or former employee of the Sellers or any SPE who is not a
Transferred Employee (including, without limitation, any liabilities arising
under any Benefit Plan or other compensation program, arrangement or
agreement of the Sellers or any SPE). The Sellers shall make their employees
available to Parent and the Buyer, at reasonable times and in a manner
intended not to disrupt ongoing operations, for the purpose of making
employment offers to such employees.   Section 6.16. Benefit Plans.   (a)
Subject to Section 6.15, Parent or the Buyer shall offer the Transferred
Employees employee benefit plans, compensation and payroll arrangements, and
other arrangements providing benefits which are substantially similar, in the
aggregate, as the benefits provided by Parent or the Buyer to similarly
situated employees of Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, as such plans or
arrangements may be amended or modified from time to time.   (b) To the
extent that any employee benefit plan or arrangement is made available
following the Closing Date except for any vacation plan or arrangement, (i)
the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to, grant all such
Transferred Employees after the Closing Date credit for all service with the
Sellers prior to the Closing Date for all purposes, except for benefit
accrual purposes, for which such service was recognized by the Sellers,
provided that there shall be no duplication of benefits; and (ii) with
respect to any "Employee Benefit Welfare Plan" (as that term is defined in
Section 3(l) of ERISA), the Buyer shall, to the extent permitted under
any applicable insurance policy, (x) waive any exclusions for pre-
existing conditions that would result in a lack of coverage for any condition
for which the applicable Transferred Employee would have been entitled
to coverage under the corresponding Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee was a participant immediately prior to his or her
commencement of participation in the Buyer\'s corresponding benefit plans;
and (y) waive any waiting period or medical examination requirement
applicable to any Transferred Employee under any such Buyer benefit plan that
such participant was not subject to under such corresponding plan.   (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall retain liability under any
Employee Benefit Welfare Plan for claims incurred by a Transferred Employee
on or prior to the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, (i)
disability or workers\' compensation claims which commence on or prior to the
Closing Date and extend beyond the Closing Date and (ii) claims of
Transferred Employees not actively at work with the Buyer or the SPEs as of
the Closing Date regarding ongoing medical conditions first arising on or
before Closing for which treatment will continue after Closing. For purposes
of this Section 6.16, a claim is "incurred" on the date the first event
giving rise thereto occurs. The Sellers shall retain liability and be
responsible for, and indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, the Buyer
and their Affiliates from any and all liabilities in respect of all employees
of the Business attributable to the period prior to, and including, the
Closing Date, including, without limitation, any accrued and unpaid bonuses
(including any bonuses that become payable upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ) with respect to the
Transferred Employees; provided that, except as otherwise provided below,
with respect to any accrued and unpaid vacation of any Transferred Employee
attributable to the period prior to, and including, the Closing Date (the
"Accrued Vacation Benefit"), Parent or the Buyer shall pay to such
Transferred Employee his or her Accrued Vacation Benefit in cash within ten
(10) Business Days of the Closing Date in full and complete satisfaction of
the Sellers\' obligations in respect of such Transferred Employee\'s Accrued
Vacation Benefit; provided, however, that, in no event will the Buyer be
responsible to pay more than $20 million in the aggregate for the aggregate
Accrued Vacation Benefits of all Transferred Employees (the "Aggregate
Vacation Benefit") and in the event the Aggregate Vacation Benefit exceeds
$20 million, the Buyer shall pay to each Transferred Employee an amount equal
to the product of (A) $20 million and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
is such Transferred Employees\' Accrued Vacation Benefit and the denominator
of which is the Aggregate Vacation Benefit (the amount so paid to such
Transferred Employee, the "Pro Rata Portion") in full and complete
satisfaction of such Transferred Employee\'s Accrued Vacation Benefit;
provided further that, the Sellers shall provide in Schedule 6.16(c) hereto,
which shall be delivered to Parent no later than the 10th day prior to the
Closing Date, the amount of each Business Employee\'s Accrued Vacation
Benefit as of the Closing Date, based on the applicable vacation plan or
policy of the Sellers in effect on the date hereof. In the event the
Aggregate Vacation Benefit exceeds $20 million, the Sellers shall pay in cash
within ten (10) Business Days of the Closing Date to each Transferred
Employee the difference between (A) such Transferred Employee\'s Accrued
Vacation Benefit and (B) such Transferred Employee\'s Pro Rata Portion.  
(d) The Sellers shall be responsible for maintaining continuation health
coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA for
employees who are not Transferred Employees and for any Transferred Employees
eligible for such coverage on the Closing Date, including, but not limited
to, employees on a disability leave as of the Closing Date. The Sellers shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, the Buyer and their Affiliates
(including any Designees) from any Claims arising from or relating to the
recruitment, employment, potential employment or termination of employment of
any Transferred Employee on or prior to the Closing Date (including, without
limitation, any Claims arising under Section 4980B of the Code or any Benefit
Plan or other compensation program, indemnification arrangement, or other
arrangement or agreement of the Sellers).   (e) The Sellers shall retain
liability and be responsible for, and indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Parent, the Buyer and their Affiliates from, (i) any sales commissions,
guaranteed draws, incentive pay, bonuses and any other payments to
Transferred Employees related to any sale programs, agreements or
arrangements in effect on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) any
severance, termination or change in control agreements or arrangements
entered into with the Transferred Employees on or prior to the Closing
Date.   (f) To the extent that any obligations might arise under WARN,
or under similar provisions of any federal, state, regional, foreign or
local law, rule or regulation (collectively, "WARN Obligations"), (i) Sellers
shall be responsible for any WARN Obligations, including, without limitation
as a result of the transactions contemplated herein arising as a result of
any employment losses, in respect of any employee who (A) is not a
Transferred Employee and (B) with respect to any such employment losses
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees; and
(ii) Parent and the Buyer shall be responsible for any WARN Obligations in
respect of the Transferred Employees arising as a result of any employment
losses occurring after the Closing Date.   Section 6.17. Transition
Services; License . (a) Parent, the Buyer and the Sellers shall enter into a
transition Services Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the "Transition Services Agreement S/B"), pursuant to which Exodus
and the Retained Subsidiaries shall provide transitional services, including
the services described in Appendix A to Exhibit A, to Parent and the Buyer on
an arm\'s length basis for 120 days following the Closing in order to
facilitate an orderly separation from Exodus and transition to ownership by
the Buyer of the Purchased Assets. The first $40,000,000 in charges, costs
and expenses for transition services provided pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement S/B shall be deemed to have been paid by virtue of the
payment of the Cash Consideration and the assumption by Parent and the Buyer
of the Assumed Liabilities.   (b) Parent and Exodus shall enter into a
transition services agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Transition Services Agreement B/S"), pursuant to which Parent
and the Buyer shall provide transitional services, including the services set
forth on Schedule 6.17(b), to Exodus and the Retained Subsidiaries on an
arm\'s length basis for so long as necessary to facilitate the orderly
disposition of the remaining businesses and assets of Exodus and the Retained
Subsidiaries.   (c) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Parent and
the Buyer elect to have the Sellers assume and assign to Buyer or its
Designee any customer Contract related primarily to a data center in the
United States or to the provision of professional services for a client
located in the United States, but pursuant to which goods or services are to
be provided to such customer outside of the United States, the Buyer and
Exodus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a
subcontracting or similar arrangement pursuant to which goods or services to
be provided outside of the United States under such Contract shall be
provided by Exodus or one of the Retained Subsidiaries. To the extent a
customer Contract retained by Exodus or any of its Subsidiaries relates
primarily to a data center outside of the United States or to the provision
of professional services for a client located outside of the United States,
but pursuant to which goods or services are to provided to such customer
outside of the United States, the Buyer and Exodus shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a subcontracting or similar arrangement
pursuant to which goods or services to be provided outside of the United
States under such Contract shall be provided by Exodus or one of the Retained
Subsidiaries.   (d) Buyer and certain of the Excluded Subsidiaries shall
enter into a License Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the "License Agreement") pursuant to which the Buyer shall license
certain Intellectual Property to the Sellers.   (e) Effective as of the
Closing Date, the Buyer or a Designee, as the case may be, covenants to
Exodus and GlobalCenter, Inc.("GlobalCenter") not to bring any claim against
Exodus or GlobalCenter in any legal or other proceeding based on any
allegation of infringement or misappropriation of any Embedded Non-Acquired
Sites Technology by Exodus or GlobalCenter arising after the Closing Date
arising out of or related to Exodus\' or GlobalCenter\'s ownership and/or
operation of the Non-Acquired Sites, provided that Exodus and or GlobalCenter
do not, at any time, except as permitted under the Transition Services
Agreement S/B (which period of operation, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not exceed the term of such agreement), operate such Non-Acquired Sites as
Internet data centers or other substantially similar businesses. The covenant
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall extend to any purchaser
or purchasers of the Non-Acquired Sites without any limitation on the
operation of the Non-Acquired Sites, provided that such purchaser or
purchasers do not otherwise infringe or misappropriate any of Buyer\'s
Intellectual Property, including the Exodus Intellectual Property. Any
assignment of the Embedded Non-Acquired Sites Technology by Buyer or a
Designee, as of the case may be, shall be subject to the covenant set forth
above.   (f) Immediately following the Closing, Alpha and each of
the Retained Subsidiaries shall cease use of any Source Code (as defined in
the License Agreement) included in the Purchased Assets and promptly
thereafter shall destroy or purge its systems and files of any such Source
Code.   Section 6.18. Conduct After Closing. The Sellers Agree that
from and after the Closing Date through the last day of the period specified
in Section 6.19(a) (or such shorter period as Parent shall specify in
writing pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement), the Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain their assets, executory contracts, unexpired
leases and any Scheduled Financing Leases as to which no determination has
been made as of the Closing Date regarding the status thereof as a Financing
Lease in order to provide transition services in accordance with the terms of
the Transition Services Agreement, including, without limitation, by (a)
not rejecting any such executory contract or unexpired lease, (b) continuing
to perform all post-petition obligations thereunder, and (c) not proposing
or seeking confirmation of any plan of reorganization or liquidation that
would be inconsistent with this Section 6.20 or the Transition Services
Agreement S/B.   Section 6.19. Use of Licensed Marks. (a) As of the Closing
Date, the Buyer agrees to grant, and hereby does grant, to the Sellers and
the Excluded Subsidiaries a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicenseable and royalty-free license, for a term of 120 days commencing on
the Closing Date, to use the Licensed Marks in the Licensed Territories
solely for the limited purpose of winding down the use of each of the
Licensed Marks in the conduct of the businesses of the Sellers in
the Licensed Territories, solely in connection with business activities
and products and services in existence, and in the manner conducted and used
in such businesses, in each case as of the Closing Date or the limited
purpose of identifying assets retained by the Sellers for the purpose of
maximizing the proceeds therefor ("Transitional Use").   (b) The Sellers
acknowledge, agree and covenant that: (i) as of the Closing Date, the
Licensed Marks and the goodwill associated therewith are the exclusive and
valuable intellectual property of the Buyer, and none of the Sellers shall
challenge the validity or enforceability of any Licensed Mark or the Buyer\'s
ownership thereof in any form or manner in any jurisdiction; and (ii) none of
the Sellers shall knowingly use the Licensed Marks in any manner likely to
impair the validity or enforceability, diminish the value of the Licensed
Marks to the Buyer, or otherwise dilute, tarnish, disparage or reflect
adversely on the Buyer or the Licensed Marks, in each case in any
jurisdiction (it being understood that the conduct of business by the
Excluded Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with the manner in which such
business was conducted prior to the Closing shall not constitute a breach of
this Section 6.19).   (c) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.19,
the Sellers are not granted any rights in any Licensed Mark, or any
goodwill therein or related thereto. The Sellers hereby acknowledge, agree
and covenant that (i) all goodwill arising out of the Sellers\' use of
the Licensed Marks shall inure exclusively to the Buyer, and (ii) all
goodwill in the Licensed Marks that may be held by the Sellers
notwithstanding the foregoing hereby is assigned to the Buyer without any
further action by any party, and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Buyer
to take any action reasonably necessary to effect such assignments, which
shall be made without additional consideration.   (d) The Sellers
acknowledge that the Licensed Marks have established extremely valuable
goodwill and reputation, and that it is of great importance to the Buyer that
high standards and reputation of the Licensed Marks be maintained.
Accordingly, in their operation of the Sellers\' businesses in the Licensed
Territories and in their use of the Licensed Marks as permitted hereunder,
the Sellers shall at all times maintain high quality control standards that
are substantially equivalent to or stricter than those standards used by the
Sellers in connection with the Sellers\' business in the Licensed Territories
prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers\' rights under Section 6.19(a) hereof
are limited to using the Licensed Marks in the identical style, typeface and
graphic appearance in which such marks are used by the Sellers as of the
Closing Date.   (e) In the event that the Sellers materially breach any of
the terms of this Section 6.19, the license granted to use the Licensed
Marks shall terminate ten (10) days after issuance by the Buyer of a
notice specifying a breach of this Section 6.19 by the Sellers, provided
that, with respect to any such breach that is curable, the Sellers have not
commenced steps to cure such breach within such ten (10) day period and
actually cured such breach within thirty (30) days after such notice.  
Section 6.20. Non-US Transactions. (a) The Sellers and Parent shall, and
shall cause Exodus Germany and the German Buyer, respectively, to, (i) use
their commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the requisite approvals of
the German Buyer and applicable Law, to enter into an agreement to sell the
assets and liabilities of Exodus Germany upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth on Schedule 6.20(a) for an aggregate purchase price of
$8,000,000, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the
definitive documentation to be entered into with respect to such transaction
(the "German Transaction") and (ii) in furtherance of clause (i), promptly
following the date hereof, enter into negotiations in good faith of the
definitive documentation with respect to the German Transaction (including a
transition services agreement, to the extent necessary to operate the German
Business for no more than 120 days following the consummation of the German
Transaction, and an escrow agreement) and consummating the transactions
contemplated thereby. Exodus shall consider in good faith, at the request of
Parent, transaction structures that would involve putting Exodus Germany into
insolvency proceedings prior to the consummation of the German Transaction
under the laws of Germany (or any other structures to limit Parent\'s and its
Affiliates\' risks in consummating the German Transaction), provided that
such structures do not adversely affect Exodus.   (b) Exodus and Parent
shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Minority
Shareholders and the Japanese Buyer, respectively, to, (i) use their
commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the requisite approvals of the
Japanese Buyer and applicable Law, to enter into an agreement to sell all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Exodus Japan to the Japanese
Buyer for an aggregate purchase price of $1.00 and to assign all amounts owed
by Exodus Japan to Exodus or any of its Affiliates for a purchase price of
$1.00, in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on
Schedule 6.20(b) (the "Japanese Transaction") and (ii) in furtherance of
clause (i), promptly following the date hereof, enter into negotiations in
good faith of the definitive documentation with respect to the Japanese
Transaction (including a transition services agreement, to the extent
necessary to maintain the continued operations of Exodus Japan for no more
than 120 days following consummation of the Japanese Transaction)
consummating the transactions contemplated thereby. Parent shall consider in
good faith, at the request of Exodus, alternative transaction structures for
the Japanese Transaction, taking into account, among other things, tax
considerations, provided that such alternative structures do not adversely
affect Parent or the Japanese Buyer.   (c) The Sellers and Parent shall,
and shall cause Exodus UK and the UK Buyer, respectively, to, (i) use their
commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the requisite approvals of the UK
Buyer and applicable Law, to enter into an agreement to sell the assets and
liabilities of Exodus UK upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth on Schedule 6.20(c) for an aggregate purchase price of $8,000,000,
subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the definitive
documentation entered into with respect to such transaction (the "UK
Transaction") and (ii) in furtherance of clause (i), promptly following the
date hereof, enter into negotiations in good faith of the definitive
documentation with respect to the UK Transaction (including a transition
services agreement, to the extent necessary to operate the UK Business for no
more than 120 days following the consummation of the UK Transaction, and an
escrow agreement) and consummating the transactions contemplated thereby.  
(d) The obligation of each of the parties to the transactions described in
this Section 6.20 to consummate such transactions shall be subject in all
respects to the execution and delivery of definitive documentation in form
and substance satisfactory to the Sellers and Parent, and, in the case of
each of the German Buyer, the Japanese Buyer and the UK Buyer, the completion
of diligence satisfactory to the relevant Buyer prior to the consummation of
such transactions. Exodus shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Exodus UK, Exodus Germany and Exodus Japan to permit, Parent, the
relevant Buyer and their representatives after the date of execution of this
Agreement to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice, to the properties, officers and employees of
Exodus UK, Exodus Germany and Exodus Japan (and the Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the outside independent accountants
of Exodus UK, Exodus Germany and Exodus Japan to be available to Parent and
each such Buyer on the same basis), and shall furnish, or cause to be
furnished, to Parent and the relevant Buyer any financial and operating data,
tax information, books and records, contracts and documents and other
information that is available with respect to Exodus UK, Exodus Germany and
Exodus Japan as Parent and each such Buyer shall from time to time reasonably
request (including any work papers of the accountants); provided, that the
foregoing shall not require the Sellers to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in its reasonable judgment would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any obligations
with respect to confidentiality or other obligations under applicable Law.
The parties agree and acknowledge that Closing is not conditioned on
completion of any of the UK Transaction, the German Transaction or the
Japanese Transaction.   (e) Exodus shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
each of Exodus UK, Exodus Germany and Exodus Japan from the date hereof until
the closing of, or such time as the parties determine not to proceed with,
the UK Transaction, the German Transaction or the Japanese Transaction,
respectively, (A) operate their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and, if applicable, the commencement and
pendency of the Bankruptcy Cases, (B) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to preserve intact their current business organizations and (C) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain their tangible assets in proper
working order and, subject to applicable Law, to not permit Exodus UK, Exodus
Germany or Exodus Japan to take any of the actions referred to in Section
6.20(b) (with all references therein to the Business and Purchased Assets
being deemed to refer to the business and assets of Exodus UK, Exodus Germany
and Exodus Japan, respectively), (ii) not take any action or assert any claim
held by them (in its capacity as creditors or direct or indirect shareholders
of Exodus Germany, Exodus Japan or Exodus UK, or otherwise) in a manner which
would prevent or delay the consummation of the German Transaction, the
Japanese Transaction or the UK Transaction, and (iii) subject to applicable
Law, use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent Exodus Germany, Exodus
Japan and Exodus UK from becoming subject to any insolvency proceedings,
other than one requested by Parent, and taking any action that could have a
material and adverse effect on the business of Exodus Germany, Exodus Japan
or Exodus UK.   (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.20
to the contrary, none of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall have
any liability to Parent, the Buyer or their Designees or Affiliates for
any action or inaction by the Minority Shareholders.   (g) (i) The Sellers
will not, and, subject to applicable Law, will use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that each of Exodus UK, Exodus Germany and Exodus Japan
will not, directly or indirectly, (x) solicit or encourage any inquiries,
discussions or proposals regarding, (y) continue, propose or enter into
negotiations or discussions with respect to, or (z) enter into any agreement
or other understanding providing for, any (A) direct or indirect acquisition
or purchase of any voting securities of, or equity interest in, any of Exodus
UK, Exodus Germany or Exodus Japan, (B) merger, consolidation, sale of a
material portion of the assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving any of Exodus UK, Exodus Germany or Exodus
Japan or (C) other transaction which would reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, prevent or materially delay any of the German Transaction,
Japanese Transaction or UK Transaction (an "Alternative Non- US
Transaction").   (ii) In the event that at any time prior to the six month 
anniversary of the Closing the Sellers receive any proposal from a third 
party to enter into an Alternative Non-US Transaction that the Sellers  would
wish to accept, the Sellers shall give written notice to Parent of  such
proposal, including the terms and conditions of such Alternative 
Transaction. Parent shall have the right to elect (either directly or 
through a Designee), by written notice delivered to the Sellers not more 
than ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such notice from the 
Sellers, to pursue the Alternative Non-US Transaction on the basis set  forth
in such notice from the Sellers. If Parent makes such election and  the
consideration payable to the Sellers in connection with the  Alternative Non-
US Transaction exceeds the amounts contemplated in  Sections 6.20(a), 6.20(b)
and 6.20(c), respectively, Parent shall be  entitled to (A) reduce the Cash
Consideration by the amount of such  excess (if such Alternative Non-US
Transaction is accepted prior to the  Closing) or (B) claim against and
deduct from the Escrowed Amount the  amount of such excess (in all other
cases). If Parent does not elect to  pursue the Alternative Transaction as
set forth above, the Sellers shall  be entitled to accept the proposal for
the Alternative Transaction on  the basis set forth in the notice from the
Sellers referred to above.   Section 6.21. Consents to Severance of Leases.
(a) Exodus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of
the relevant landlord, or otherwise to enter into arrangements with the
relevant landlord, to enable the Buyer or its any of its Designees to assume
and assign, or to enter into, a separate lease with respect to the Internet
data centers identified as Chicago 1, DC 4 (Buildings 1 and 2 in Phase I of
the relevant lease) and Dallas 1, (Buildings 1 and 2 in the relevant lease),
in each case, (i) without any obligation on the part of the Buyer or any such
Designee, whether to pay rent or otherwise, in respect of any of the other
property currently covered by the existing leases relating to such data
centers, (ii) for a rental rate not exceeding the portion of the existing
rent obligations under such lease allocable to such Internet data center
(which allocation is set forth in column "A" of Schedule 6.21), and (iii) on
such other terms and conditions not less favorable to the Buyer or its
Designee than the terms and conditions set forth in such existing lease
(except for any terms and conditions as do not currently apply to such
Internet data center). The costs and expenses of obtaining such consents or
making such other arrangements shall be borne by Exodus. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Buyer and its Designees to, provide reasonable cooperation to
Exodus in connection with the obtaining of such consents or making of such
arrangements.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.21(a), at
the election of Exodus by written notice to Parent on or prior to the fifth
(5th) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, in lieu of obtaining any of
the consents, or entering into such other arrangements, as are described
in Section 6.21(a) Exodus may specify that any of the Internet data
center described in Schedule 6.21 shall thereafter be deemed a Non-Acquired
Site and the relevant lease shall not be deemed an Assumed Lease, in which
event the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the amount set forth with
respect to such Internet data center in column "B" of Schedule 6.21 (the
aggregate of any such reductions, the "Excluded Lease Amount").   Section
6.22. Additional Payments in respect of Austin 2. Parent and the Buyer agree
that Exodus may, directly or indirectly through the SPEs, enter into an
agreement prior to the Closing to dispose of the Internet data center
referred to as Austin 2, in which event the Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate, at Exodus\' expense, such sale, provided
that any such agreement shall be conditional upon the receipt of
any necessary consents under the Securitization Documents. In the event any
such disposition is completed within six (6) months after the Closing, Buyer
shall pay to Exodus, within ten (10) Business Days after the completion of
such disposition, an amount equal to the first $15,000,000 of the net
proceeds received in connection with such disposition and fifty percent (50%)
of any net proceeds received in excess of $15,000,000. For this purpose,
"net proceeds" mean the cash proceeds received from any such disposition less
any costs, fees or expenses incurred by the Buyer (or the SPE) in connection
with such disposition.   Section 6.23. Letters of Credit; Security
Deposits. (a) The Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
release to the Sellers at the Closing of the cash deposits set forth in
Schedule 2.1(a)(i) and any cash collateral securing Exodus\'s reimbursement
obligation in respect of the letters of credit set forth in Schedule 6.23.
Such efforts shall include arranging for the issuance of replacement letters
of credit in an amount not to exceed the amount of each such letter of credit
set forth on Schedule 6.23.   (b) For a period of six (6) months following
the Closing, Exodus shall be entitled to receive from Parent or the Buyer if,
and to the extent that, Exodus obtains and delivers to Parent or Buyer an
estoppel letter from the owner of the relevant property in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer, in which such owner agrees in substance not to
make any claims against any security deposits (or agrees to limit such
claims) included in the Purchased Assets except in respect of action or
omissions after the date of such estoppel letter, a payment in an amount
equal to the amount of such security deposit (or portion thereof).  
Section 6.24. Shutdown of Certain Non-Acquired Sites. The Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to shutdown the eleven (11) Internet data
centers specified on Schedule 6.24 as promptly as practicable in accordance
with the anticipated shutdown dates set forth in such Schedule, but in no
event later than April 30, 2002. For purposes of this Section 6.24, to
"shutdown" an Internet data center shall mean to terminate all services
to customers serviced in such Internet data center, and to remove all
personal property that is not attached to real property (other than being
plugged into an electrical outlet(s) and/or rack mounted) at the Internet
data center.   ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   Section 7.1.
Conditions Precedent to Obligations of the Sellers and the Buyer. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the
Closing Date of the following conditions precedent:   (a) a Primary Sale
Order and a Primary 365 Contracts Order (which may be the same order), in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and meeting the
requirements of Section 6.1(a)(ii) hereof, shall be entered by the Bankruptcy
Court;   (b) The applicable appeal periods with respect to the Primary Sale
Order and the Primary 365 Contracts Order shall have expired and such Orders
shall have become Final Orders; provided, however, notwithstanding Section
7.1(a) hereof, the Buyer shall be obligated to close following the expiration
of the applicable appeal periods even if such Orders have been appealed, so
long as (i) the effectiveness of such Orders has not been stayed pending
appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) in the reasonable good
faith judgment of Parent, after consultation with counsel and taking into
account Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, the reversal or modification
of such Orders as a result of any then pending appeal would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Purchased Assets, and (iii) Section 363(m) of
the Bankruptcy Code shall remain in full force and effect and there shall
have been no material change in the judicial interpretation of such statutory
provision;   (c) (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or
any applicable comparable foreign merger control authority, and any

to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing Date:   (a) by mutual written consent of Exodus and Parent;   (b)
by Parent, if the Auction does not occur on or before January 14, 2002 or the
Closing does not occur on or before February 15, 2002; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)
shall not be available to Parent if Parent or the Buyer shall have failed to
perform, or caused any of its respective Subsidiaries to perform, any of its
respective material obligations under this Agreement;   (c) by Exodus, if
the Closing does not occur on or before March 31, 2002; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)
shall not be available to Exodus if Exodus or any Seller shall have failed to
perform, or caused any of its respective Subsidiaries to perform, any of its
respective material obligations under this Agreement;   (d) by either
Exodus, on the one hand, or Parent on the other hand, if consummation of the

final Judgment of any court or Governmental Entity having competent
jurisdiction;   (e) by Parent on or before December 20, 2001, if the

on or before February 5, 2002;   (g) by Exodus, if Exodus accepts or is
about to accept a Qualified Bid at the Auction other than that of Parent and

immediately after termination hereunder;   (h) by Parent, if Exodus gives

consents have not been obtained;   (i) by Parent or Exodus, in the event
Exodus enters into a binding commitment with respect to, or consummates, an
Alternative Transaction;   (j) by either Parent or Exodus if any condition
precedent to the obligations of Parent and the Buyer or the obligations of

or prior to the date set forth in Section 8.1(b);   (k) by Exodus, upon a
breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or the Buyer set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representations or warranty of Parent or
the Buyer shall have been or become untrue, in each case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) would not be satisfied, so long
as Exodus is not then in breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that if any such breach is curable prior to January 31,
2002 by Parent or the Buyer through the use of commercially reasonable
efforts, following written notice of such breach from Exodus, for as long as
Parent or the Buyer shall be using its commercially reasonable best efforts
to cure such breach, Exodus may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(k); and   (l) by Parent, upon a breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representations or warranty of the Sellers shall have been or become untrue,
in each case such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b)
would not be satisfied, so long as Parent is not then in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that if any such breach
is curable prior to January 31, 2002 by the Sellers through the use of
commercially reasonable best efforts, following written notice of such breach
from Parent, for as long as such Seller shall be using its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach, Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(l).   Section 8.2. Notice of
Termination. In the event of any termination pursuant to this Article VIII,
written notice thereof setting forth the reasons therefor shall promptly be
given to the other parties and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by any party.  
Section 8.3. Abandonment. If this Agreement is terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in Section
8.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect,
except for the provisions of (i) Section 6.7 relating to the obligations of
the Sellers, on the one hand, and Parent and the Buyer, on the other hand,
to keep confidential certain information and data obtained by them, (ii)
Section 6.4, relating to certain payments to be made to Parent in connection
with an Alternative Transaction, (iii) Section 10.3, relating to publicity,
and (iv) Section 10.2, relating to certain expenses. Nothing in this Section
8.3 shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any breach by
such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the
right of any party to compel specific performance by any other party of
its obligations under this Agreement, except in the event Parent, Buyer or
its Designees shall have received the Break-Up Fee or Expense Reimbursement,
in which case no such liability shall attach.   ARTICLE IX  
INDEMNIFICATION   Section 9.1. Survival of Representations. The
representations and warranties of Exodus and Parent contained in Article III
and Article IV of this Agreement or in any other instrument delivered in
connection herewith shall survive for six months following the Closing Date,
after which such representations or warranties shall terminate and not have
any force or effect and shall not constitute the basis for any further claim
in contract, tort or otherwise by Parent or the Buyer against any Seller or
by any Seller against Parent, absent fraud. Following the Closing Date, the
remedies provided in this Article IX shall be the sole recourse of each of
the parties hereto for all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses arising out of this Agreement, other than those in Section
2.2(d)(ii), Section 2.2(g), the penultimate sentence of Section 2.4(a),
Article V, Section 6.13 and Section 6.16. Each of the covenants of the
parties hereto shall terminate as of the Closing other than those which by
their terms contemplate performance after the Closing Date.   Section 9.2.
Agreement to Indemnify. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Article IX, Exodus shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and
the Buyer and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
Affiliates (including any Designee) from any losses, liabilities, claims (as
defined in Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code), damages or expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, fixed, liquidated, contingent or otherwise (collectively, "Claims")
which result from (i) the Excluded Liabilities and/or (ii) any breach of (A)
the representations made by the Sellers in Article III of this Agreement or
(B) the covenants made by the Sellers in this Agreement or (C) in the event
the Japanese Transaction is consummated, the representations and covenants of
Exodus contained in the definitive documentation entered into with respect to
the Japanese Transaction.   (b) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Article IX, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Exodus and its directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates
from any Claims which result from (i) the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) any
breach of (A) the representations made by Parent and the Buyer in Article IV
of this Agreement or (B) the covenants made by Parent and the Buyer in this
Agreement and/or (iii) the operation of the Business by Parent and/or the
Buyer or Parent\'s and/or the Buyer\'s ownership, operation or use of the
Purchased Assets following the Closing Date.   Section 9.3. Conditions of
Indemnification for Third-Party Claims. Subject to the provisions of Section
9.4, the obligations and liabilities of Exodus and Parent, in the case of
Section 9.2, with respect to Claims made by or against third parties ("Third
Party Claims") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:  
(a) The person to whom such Third Party Claim relates (the "Indemnified
Party") will give the party required to provide such indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of such Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party will (except as otherwise contemplated by the proviso to
Section 9.3(b) hereof) assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by it
(such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party);
provided, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in such
action and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of
such Third Party Claim.   (b) If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable
time after notice of any such Third Party Claim, fails to assume the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or, with
the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), to undertake a compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any compromise or
settlement of a Third Party Claim effected without its written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld so long as such compromise or
settlement requires only the payment of money damages). During any period
when the Indemnifying Party is contesting any such Third Party Claim in good
faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, compromise or settle such Third
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party\'s consent; provided, that the
Indemnified Party may nonetheless pay, compromise or settle such Third Party
Claim without such consent during such period, in which event it shall,
automatically and without any further action on its part, waive any right
(whether or not pursuant to this Agreement) to indemnity in respect of all
losses, liabilities, damages or expenses relating to such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim until such
Third Party Claim shall be adjudicated by order, decree, ruling or other
action, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right, in the exercise of
its exclusive discretion, to determine whether or not to appeal
such adjudication.   (c) Anything in this Section 9.3 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably or delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any Judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Claimant and/or plaintiff to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liabilities in respect of such Third
Party Claim.   (d) The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide the Indemnifying Party with such assistance (without
charge) as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnifying Party in
connection with any indemnification or defense provided for herein,
including, without limitation, providing the Indemnifying Party with such
information, documents and records as shall be reasonably available and
reasonable access to the services of and consultations with such personnel of
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates as the Indemnifying Party shall
reasonably deem necessary (provided that such access shall not unreasonably
interfere with the performance of the duties performed by or responsibilities
of such personnel).   Section 9.4. Limitation of Indemnification. Any Claim
brought under Section 9.2 is subject in each case to the following
limitations and restrictions:   (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, claims described in Section 9.2 may not be asserted at any time
after the close of business on the first Business Day that is one year after
the Closing Date.   (b) Claims made pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (except for
any Claims based on Section 5.1) will be paid only to the extent that the
aggregate amount of all such Claims exceeds $2,500,000 (the "Deductible") at
which point Exodus shall be liable for the amount of such Claims in excess
thereof, provided, however, that the aggregate amount recoverable pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) in excess thereof shall in no event exceed the Escrowed
Amount together with any interest or earnings thereon. Claims made pursuant
to Section 9.2(b) (except for any Claims based on Section 5.1) will be paid
only to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such Claims exceeds
$2,500,000 at which point Parent shall be liable for the amount of such
Claims in excess thereof; provided, however, that the aggregate amount
recoverable pursuant to Section 9.2(b) (except for any Claims based on
Section 5.1) shall in no event exceed $56,000,000.   (c) Each Claim shall
be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds (net of expenses of
collection) actually received in connection with such Claim; the parties
covenant to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to collect insurance
proceeds under applicable insurance policies that are then in force if and to
the extent that such Claim relates to an event covered by such insurance
policies and if Parent or the Buyer shall receive any insurance proceeds
after payment of any Claim by Exodus, Parent or the Buyer shall deposit in
the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement the lesser of
the amount of insurance proceeds (net of expenses of collection) and the
amount actually paid by Exodus to Parent or the Buyer in respect of such
Claim.   (d) In determining whether Parent or the Buyer is entitled
to recover for any Claim under Section 9.2(b)(i), (A) all references to
the Knowledge of any Person in the representations and warranties of
Sellers shall be disregarded, (B) the representations and warranties of
Sellers shall not be deemed qualified by any references to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect contained therein and (C) any breaches thereof shall
be determined without regard to whether such breach constitutes a Material
Adverse Effect; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the Buyer
be entitled (i) to recover for any Claim relating to or arising out of a
breach of any representation or warranty herein of Exodus pursuant to which
the aggregate loss, expense, liability or damage does not exceed $200,000;
(ii) to aggregate any such items with a value of $200,000 or less for the
purpose of exceeding the limitation set forth in clause (i) of this Section
9.4(d) or the Deductible; or (iii) to otherwise submit such items as
Claims reimbursable pursuant to this Article IX.   Section 9.5. Security
for Indemnification. To secure the obligations of the Sellers (a) pursuant to
Section 2.2(d)(ii), Section 2.2(g), the penultimate sentence of Section
2.4(c) and Section 6.16, (b) pursuant to Article V and (c) to indemnify the
Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates
(including any Buyer\'s Designee) under this Article IX, at the Closing,
Parent will deposit the Escrowed Amount and the Scheduled Lease Amount with
the Escrow Agent, to be held and released in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. Any Lease Adjustment, any payment required to be made by
the Sellers pursuant to Article V and any indemnification required to be made
by the Sellers pursuant to this Article IX shall be satisfied solely pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, that the Buyer may, in its
sole discretion, seek recovery of any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to
Section 2.2(d)(ii) and the penultimate sentence of Section 2.4(a) directly
from the Sellers. The term of the Escrow Agreement shall run for one year
plus any additional period required to resolve any disputed claim
thereunder.   Section 9.6. Purchase Price Adjustment. Any payment by
the Sellers under this Article IX shall be treated by the parties hereto for
all Tax purposes as a reduction to the Cash Consideration in a manner
consistent with the Final Allocation determined under Section 5.2.  
ARTICLE X   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 10.1. Amendment and Waiver. Any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
each of the Sellers, Parent and the Buyer, or in the case of a waiver, by the
party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any
party or parties in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.   Section 10.2. Expenses. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Section 6.4, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, the parties shall bear their own respective
expenses (including, but not limited to, all compensation and expenses of
counsel, financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent
accountants) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Exodus shall bear any expenses or fees necessary to
obtain the consents and waivers required by items A, B and C of Schedule
7.3(g).   Section 10.3. Public Disclosure. Each of the parties to
this Agreement agrees with the other parties hereto that, except as may
be required to comply with the requirements of applicable Law or the
requests, rules and regulations of each stock exchange upon which the
securities of one of the parties or its Affiliates is listed, no press
release or similar public announcement or communication will be made or
caused to be made concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement
unless specifically approved in advance by all parties hereto; provided,
however, that to the extent that either party to this Agreement is required
by applicable Law or the requests, rules and regulations of any stock
exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties or its Affiliates is
listed to make such a public disclosure, such public disclosure shall only be
made after prior consultation with the other party to this Agreement.  
Section 10.4. Specific Performance. The parties recognize that if any party
breaches this Agreement or refuses to perform under the provisions of this
Agreement, monetary damages alone would not be adequate to compensate the
non-breaching party or parties for their injuries. The non-breaching party or
parties shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement. If any action is brought by the non-breaching party or parties to
enforce this Agreement, the party in breach shall waive the defense that
there is an adequate remedy at law.   Section 10.5. Assignment. This
Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall not
be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred, by Parent, the Buyer or the
Sellers; provided, however, that the Buyer may assign their rights to
purchase the Purchased Assets or assume any Assigned Contract to one or more
of their wholly-owned Subsidiaries, but in no event will such assignment
relieve the Buyer of its obligations hereunder.   Section 10.6. Entire
Agreement. This Agreement (including all Schedules hereto) contains the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, with respect to such matters, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement, which will (other than the fifth and sixth paragraphs thereof)
remain in full force and effect for the term provided for therein.  
Section 10.7. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.   Section 10.8. Parties in
Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than Parent, the Buyer
and the Sellers, or their successors or permitted assigns, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.   Section 10.9. Schedules.
The inclusion of any matter in any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed
to be an inclusion for all purposes of this Agreement, to the extent that
such disclosure is sufficient to identify the section to which such
disclosure is responsive, but inclusion therein shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission, or otherwise imply, that any such matter is material
or creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this Agreement. If,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, an
event occurs that renders untrue any representation or warranty of Exodus (a
"Subsequent Event"), Exodus shall promptly deliver to Parent an amended or
supplemental Schedule (a "Subsequent Disclosure Schedule") which will contain
a description of the Subsequent Event; provided, however, that this Section
10.9 is not intended to permit the Sellers to alter or amend the
representations and warranties as made herein and shall not cure the
inaccuracy thereof for any purpose under this Agreement. The disclosure of
any particular fact or item in any Schedule, Disclosure Letter or Subsequent
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission as to whether the fact
or item is "material" or would constitute a "Material Adverse Effect."  
Section 10.10. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original by the parties executing such counterpart, but all of which shall be
considered one and the same instrument.   Section 10.11. Headings. The
section and paragraph headings and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   Section 10.12. Notices. All
notices and other communications hereunder shall be deemed given if in
writing and delivered personally, sent by facsimile (confirm receipt), by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or nationally

fact that this Agreement has been drafted or prepared by one of the parties,
the parties confirm that both they and their respective counsel have
reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement
and understanding of the parties, and the language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction construing
ambiguities against the draftsperson shall be applied against any Person.  
Section 10.14. Governing Law. Except to the extent the mandatory provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code apply, this agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts made and to be performed entirely in such state without regard to
principles of conflicts or choice of laws or any other law that would make
the laws of any other jurisdiction other than the State of New York
applicable hereto. The parties agree that, except as provided herein or in
the Escrow Agreement, without limitation of any party\'s right to appeal any
order of the Bankruptcy Court, (a) the Bankruptcy Court shall
retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to
decide any claims or disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected
with, this Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the
transactions contemplated herein; and (b) any and all claims, actions, causes
of action, suits and proceedings relating to the foregoing shall be filed and
maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the parties hereby consent and
submit to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.   Section 10.15.
Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision
of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or entity or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other persons, entities or circumstances
shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability.   [Remainder
