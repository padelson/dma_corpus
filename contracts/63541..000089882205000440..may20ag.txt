vi     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of May 19, 2005,  among
TRITON ACQUISITION HOLDING CO., a Delaware corporation  ("PARENT"), TRITON
ACQUISITION CO., a Delaware corporation and a  wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent ("SUB"), and MAYTAG  CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY").   WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and
the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS
the respective Boards of Directors of Sub and the Company have approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the merger (the "MERGER") of Sub into
the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $1.25 per
share, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") not owned by Parent, Sub or
the Company shall be converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash, and
Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, shall adopt this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable following its execution; and   WHEREAS Parent, Sub
and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.01. THE MERGER. On the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION"). The Merger, the payment of cash in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Financing) are referred to herein as the "TRANSACTIONS".   SECTION 1.02.
CLOSING. The closing (the "CLOSING") of the Merger shall take place at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York
10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day following the satisfaction
(or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such day any condition set forth in
Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted
by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof), as
soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article VII have
been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the
parties      2  entitled to the benefits thereof), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the
Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "CLOSING DATE".   SECTION 1.03. EFFECTIVE TIME. Prior to
the Closing, Parent shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter the Surviving Corporation shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the
"CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such subsequent time
as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "EFFECTIVE
TIME").   SECTION 1.04. EFFECTS. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.   SECTION 1.05. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
AND BY-LAWS. (a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended at the
Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended,
such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.   (b) The By-laws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended at the Effective
Time to read in the form of Exhibit B hereto and, as so amended, such By-laws
shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   SECTION 1.06.
DIRECTORS. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.   SECTION 1.07. OFFICERS. The officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, as the case may be.      3  ARTICLE II   EFFECT ON THE
CAPITAL STOCK OF THE  CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  
SECTION 2.01. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:   (a) CAPITAL
STOCK OF SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall
be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.  
(c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and
2.01(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash (the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION").   (2) As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
theretofore representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
2.02, without interest, and except as otherwise provided with respect to
unpaid dividends and other distributions in Section 2.02(c).   (d)
APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares ("APPRAISAL SHARES") of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies with, Section 262 of the
DGCL ("SECTION 262") shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall
be entitled to the rights provided for under Section 262; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then such
holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c) and unpaid
dividends and other distributions as provided in Section 2.02(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior     4   written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.   SECTION 2.02. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a)
PAYING AGENT. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent
(the "PAYING AGENT") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon
surrender of certificates representing Company Common Stock. Parent shall
take all steps necessary to enable, and shall cause, the Surviving
Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent, concurrently with the Closing,
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND").   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURE.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the
"CERTIFICATES") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered,
if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Subject to Section 2.01(d) and except as otherwise provided with respect to
unpaid dividends and other distributions in Section 2.02(c), until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall
be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.  
(c) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II
upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have
been paid     5  in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock, SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares
of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.   (d) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common
Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.  
(e) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise irrevocably
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such
shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.   (f) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Paying
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by
Parent, in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest
or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from
either Moody\'s Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s, a division of
The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof; PROVIDED that, in any
such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months
from the date of the investment therein. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.   (g) WITHHOLDING
RIGHTS. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any other provision of applicable Federal, state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the    
6  holders of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.   (h) LOST CERTIFICATES.
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost,
stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that, except
as set forth in the disclosure letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, from the Company to Parent and Sub (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
LETTER") or in any Company SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement (each, a "FILED COMPANY SEC DOCUMENT"):  
SECTION 3.01. ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (each, a "COMPANY SUBSIDIARY") (a) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized, other than defects in such organization, existence or
good standing that, individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (b) has full
corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to
enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such corporate
power and authority, franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals the lack of which, individually and in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary or the failure to so qualify
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as
so amended, the "COMPANY CHARTER"), and the by-laws of the Company, as
amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "COMPANY BY-
LAWS").   SECTION 3.02. COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES; EQUITY INTERESTS. (a) Section
3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each "significant subsidiary",
as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act
(each, a "SIGNIFICANT COMPANY SUBSIDIARY"), and its jurisdiction
of organization. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Company Subsidiary have been validly issued     7  and are fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by another Company Subsidiary
or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all
pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of
any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS").   (b) Except for its
interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, equity membership interest, partnership
interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any person.  
SECTION 3.03. CAPITAL STRUCTURE. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 24,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share ("COMPANY PREFERRED
STOCK" and, together with the Company Common Stock, the "COMPANY CAPITAL
STOCK"). At the close of business on April 30, 2005, (i) 79,694,548 shares of
Company Common Stock (each together with a Company Right) and no shares of
Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) 37,456,045 shares
of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury,
(iii) 7,758,643 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to outstanding
Company Employee Stock Options and 818,396 additional shares of Company
Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plans
and (iv) 4,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock were reserved for
issuance in connection with the rights (the "COMPANY RIGHTS") issued pursuant
to the Rights Agreement dated as of February 12, 1998 (as amended from time
to time, the "COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), between the Company and
Computershare Investor Services, LLC, as Rights Agent. At the close of
business on April 30, 2005, there were outstanding rights to purchase 13,389
shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP (assuming the fair market value
per share of Company Common Stock on the last day of the then current
offering period in effect under the ESPP will be equal to the Merger
Consideration). As of April 30, 2005, the aggregate amount credited to the
accounts of participants in the ESPP was $187,440. Except as set forth above,
at the close of business on April 30, 2005, no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. During the period from April 30, 2005 to the date of this
Agreement, (x) there have been no issuances by the Company of shares
of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company other than
issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of
Company Employee Stock Options outstanding on such date as required by their
terms as in effect on the date of such issuance and (y) there have been no
issuances by the Company of options, warrants or other rights to acquire
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company. There are
no outstanding Company SARs that were not granted in tandem with a related
Company Employee Stock Option. All outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock are, and all such shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time
will be when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the Company
Charter, the Company By-laws or any Contract to which the Company is a party
or otherwise bound. There are not any bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into,     8  or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote)
on any matters on which holders of Company Capital Stock may vote ("VOTING
COMPANY DEBT"). Except as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are not any options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable
securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based
performance units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of
any kind to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of them is bound (i) obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests in, or any
security convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital
stock of or other equity interest in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or any Voting Company Debt, (ii) obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, security, unit, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking
or (iii) that give any person the right to receive any economic benefit or
right similar to or derived from the economic benefits and rights occurring
to holders of Company Capital Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are not any outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company has
made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Company Rights
Agreement, as amended to the date of this Agreement.   (b) The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent a true, complete and correct list of
all outstanding Company Employee Stock Options, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Employee Stock Option, the
grant dates, exercise prices, expiration dates and vesting schedule of each
such Company Employee Stock Option and the names of the holders of each
Company Employee Stock Option. All outstanding Company Employee Stock Options
are evidenced by the forms of Company Employee Stock Option
agreements delivered or made available to Parent, and no Company Employee
Stock Option agreement contains terms that are materially inconsistent with,
or in addition in any material respect to, the terms contained therein.  
SECTION 3.04. AUTHORITY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY ENFORCEABILITY. (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions to be performed or consummated by the Company. The execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other Transactions to be performed or consummated by
the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement, and this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights, and to general equity principles.     9   (b) The Board of
Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY BOARD"), at a meeting duly called and
held, duly adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions to be performed or consummated by the Company, (ii)
determining that the terms of the Merger and the other Transactions to be
performed or consummated by the Company are fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) directing that this Agreement be
submitted to a vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting, (iv) recommending
that the Company\'s stockholders adopt this Agreement and (v) declaring the
advisability of this Agreement. Assuming that the representation set forth in
the second sentence of Section 4.02(c) is true and correct, such resolutions
of the Company Board are sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and Sub
and this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions (i)
the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL and (ii) the provisions of Article Eleventh of the Company Charter. To
the Company\'s knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation applies or purports to apply to the Company with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction.   (c) Assuming that
the representation set forth in the second sentence of Section 4.02(c) is
true and correct, the only vote of holders of any class or series of Company
Capital Stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is
the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon
(the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"). The affirmative vote of the holders of
Company Capital Stock, or any of them, is not necessary to consummate any
Transaction other than the Merger.   SECTION 3.05. NO CONFLICTS; CONSENTS.
(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with
the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or
default (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to increased,
additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any person
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i)
the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any contract, lease,
license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, permit, concession, franchise or
other instrument (a "CONTRACT") to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred
to in Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order or decree ("JUDGMENT") or statute,
law (including common law), ordinance, rule or regulation ("LAW") applicable
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such
items that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) No consent,
approval, license, permit, order or authorization ("CONSENT") of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from,
any Federal,     10   state, local or foreign government or any court
of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other
governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a
"GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"), is required to be obtained or made by or with respect
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT"),
(ii) any additional Consents and filings under any foreign antitrust,
competition, premerger notification or trade regulation law, regulation or
order ("ANTITRUST LAWS") (including, if applicable, the Competition Act
(Canada)) or under the Investment Canada Act (Canada), (iii) the filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy
or information statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Company\'s stockholders (the "PROXY STATEMENT") and (B) such reports
under, or other applicable requirements of, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), as may be required in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (iv) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other
jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do business, (v)
compliance with and such filings as may be required under applicable
Environmental Laws, (vi) such filings as may be required in connection with
the Taxes described in Section 6.09, (vii) filings under any applicable state
takeover Law and (viii) such other items that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) The Company and the Company Board have taken all
action necessary to (i) render the Company Rights Agreement inapplicable to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and (ii) ensure that
(A) neither Parent nor any of its affiliates or associates is or will become
an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) by reason
of this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction, (B) a "Distribution
Date" or a "Share Acquisition Date" (as each such term is defined in the
Company Rights Agreement) shall not occur by reason of this Agreement, the
Merger or any other Transaction and (C) the Company Rights shall expire
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   SECTION 3.06. SEC DOCUMENTS;
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. (a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by the Company
with the SEC since January 1, 2003 pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (the "COMPANY SEC DOCUMENTS").   (b) As of its respective
date, each Company SEC Document complied as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information
contained in any Filed Company SEC     11  Document has been revised or
superseded by a later filed Filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company
SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in the Company SEC Documents (including the related notes
and schedules thereto) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments).   (c) Other than liabilities or
obligations (i) disclosed or provided for in the financial statements
included in the Filed Company SEC Documents or (ii) incurred since March 31,
2005 in the ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
or in the notes thereto and that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Each
of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company (or each former principal executive officer and former principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications
required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the Exchange
Act (collectively, the "SARBANES-OXLEY ACT") with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the Company has delivered to Parent a summary of
any disclosure made by the Company\'s management to the Company\'s auditors
and audit committee referred to in such certifications. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.  (e) The Company has (i) designed disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer; (ii) designed internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP; (iii) evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company\'s disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable     12  Company SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation; and (iv) to the extent required by applicable Law, disclosed in
such report or amendment any change in the Company\'s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by such
report or amendment that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company\'s internal control over financial
reporting.   (f) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Company\'s
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company\'s internal control over financial reporting.   (g) None of the
Company Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1, 2003 been,
subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.   (h) As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no applicable accounting rule, consensus or
pronouncement that has been adopted by the SEC, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the Emerging Issues Task Force or any similar body but that
is not in effect as of the date of this Agreement that, if implemented, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (i)
Since July 30, 2002, the Company has been in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in effect
from time to time.   SECTION 3.07. INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made
by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by Parent or Sub in writing for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.   SECTION 3.08. ABSENCE OF
CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. From the date of the most recent audited financial
statements included in the Filed Company SEC     13  Documents to the
date of this Agreement, the Company has conducted its business only in the
ordinary course, and during such period there has not been:   (i) any event,
change, effect, development, condition or occurrence  that, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to  have a Company Material
Adverse Effect;   (ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or  other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with
respect to any  Company Common Stock or any repurchase for value by the
Company of any  Company Common Stock, other than quarterly cash dividends

Company Common  Stock or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of
any other  securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares

Company Subsidiary to any  current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of  the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, a
"PARTICIPANT") of any loan  or any increase in any type of compensation,
benefits, perquisites or any  bonus or award, except for grants of normal
cash bonus opportunities and  normal increases of cash compensation
(including compensation in connection  with new hires), in each case in the
ordinary course of business consistent  with past practice or as was required
under employment agreements in effect  as of the date of the most recent
audited financial statements included in  the Filed Company SEC Documents,
(B) any payment of any bonus to any  Participant, except for bonuses paid in
the ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice, (C) any
granting by the Company or any  Company Subsidiary to any Participant of any
severance, change in control,  termination or similar compensation, pay or
benefits or increases therein,  or of the right to receive any severance,
change in control, termination or  similar compensation, pay or benefits or
increases therein, except (x) as  was required under any employment,

Company Subsidiary, except insofar as may have been required  by a change in
GAAP or applicable Law;   (vii) any material elections with respect to Taxes
by the Company or  any Company Subsidiary or settlement or compromise by the

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed, or has caused
to be timely filed on its behalf, all material Tax Returns required to
be filed by or on behalf of the Company and each Company Subsidiary in the
manner prescribed by applicable Law. All such Tax Returns are complete and
correct, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary has timely paid (or the Company has paid on each such
Company Subsidiary\'s behalf) all Taxes due and owing, and, in accordance
with GAAP, the most recent financial statements contained in the Filed
Company SEC Documents reflect a reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred
Taxes) for all Taxes payable by the Company and each Company Subsidiary for
all     15  taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statement, in each case except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) No Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is under audit or examination by any Taxing Authority, and no written notice
or, to the knowledge of the Company, unwritten notice of such an audit or
examination has been received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Each
material assessed deficiency resulting from any audit or examination relating
to Taxes by any Taxing Authority has been timely paid and there is no
assessed deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in

(d) There is no agreement or other document extending, or having the effect
of extending, the period of assessment or collection of any material Taxes
and no power of attorney with respect to any such Taxes has been executed or
filed with any Taxing Authority by or on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.   (e) No material Liens for Taxes exist with respect to
any assets or properties of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for
statutory liens for Taxes not yet due.   (f) Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any material Tax sharing
agreement, material Tax indemnity obligation or similar material agreement or
arrangement with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing agreement,
closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any Taxing
Authority), other than any such agreements (i) with customers, vendors,
lessors or similar persons entered into in the ordinary course of business
and (ii) among the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.   (g) Except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each Company Subsidiary has
complied with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121
and 3402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE") or

after the Closing Date taxable income attributable to income that accrued in
a prior taxable period but was not recognized in any prior taxable period as
a result of the installment method of accounting, the long-term contract
method of accounting, the cash method of accounting or Section 481 of the
Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law.   (j)
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in any
"listed transaction" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4.  
SECTION 3.10. ABSENCE OF CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLANS. (a) From the date of the
most recent audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents to the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has terminated, adopted, amended, modified or agreed to

or any Company Subsidiary or any other person or entity that, together with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, is treated as a single employer under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any other applicable Law
(each, a "COMMONLY CONTROLLED ENTITY"), in each case providing benefits to
any Participant and whether or not subject to United States law (all such
plans, programs, arrangements and understandings, including any such
plan, program, arrangement or understanding entered into or adopted on or
after the date of this Agreement, "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS") or has made any
change, in any material respect, in any actuarial or other assumption used to
calculate funding obligations with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that
is a Company Pension Plan, or any change, in any material respect, in the
manner in which contributions to any such Company Pension Plan are made or
the basis on which such contributions are determined.   (b) Section 3.10 of
the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and correct list of (i) any
material employment, deferred compensation, severance, change in control,
termination, employee benefit, loan (other than Participant loans under any
Company Pension Plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement
within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code), indemnification,
retention, stock repurchase, stock option, consulting or similar agreement,

Participant, on the other hand, the benefits of which are contingent, or
the terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence of
transactions involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary of the nature
contemplated by this Agreement     17  (all such agreements,
collectively, the "COMPANY BENEFIT AGREEMENTS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Company Benefit Agreements maintained primarily for the benefit
of Participants (other than officers or directors of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) who are principally employed in jurisdictions other than
the United States of America (all such agreements, collectively, the
"NON-U.S. BENEFIT AGREEMENTS") are not listed in Section 3.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (but a list of such Non-U.S. Benefit Agreements
shall be provided to Parent within 20 days following the date of this
Agreement).   SECTION 3.11. ERISA COMPLIANCE; EXCESS PARACHUTE
PAYMENTS. (a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and correct list of all Company Benefit Plans that are "employee

plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other material Company
Benefit Plans; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Company Benefit Agreement shall be
deemed a Company Benefit Plan or listed in Section 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that Company Benefit Plans
maintained primarily for the benefit of Participants principally employed in
jurisdictions other than the United States of America (all such plans,
collectively, the "NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS") are not listed in Section 3.11(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter (but a list of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plans
shall be provided to Parent within 20 days following the date of this
Agreement). Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in
compliance with its terms and applicable Law, and the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining agreements, except to the extent that the failure to
comply with any such terms or Law, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available (or, with respect to Non-U.S. Benefit
Plans and Non-U.S. Benefit Agreements, shall deliver or make available within
20 days following the date of this Agreement) to Parent complete and correct
copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement
(or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement, a description thereof), (ii) the most recent annual report on Form

Company Benefit Plan for which such a report is required, (iii) the most

for each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment
in the United States of America, as well as a true, correct and complete copy
of each pending application for such letter, if applicable, and (vi) the most
recent actuarial valuation, if applicable, for each Company Pension Plan.  
(b) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified have been the
subject of determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to all tax Law changes through the Economic Growth and Tax
Relief Reconciliation Act of     18  2001 with respect to which a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service can be obtained to the
effect that such Company Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and
no such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Company Pension
Plan been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs or require security under
Section 307 of ERISA. All Company Pension Plans that are required to
have been approved by any non-U.S. Governmental Entity have been so
approved.   (c) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity
has maintained, contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute
to, or has any liability under, any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA. With respect to the Maytag Corporation Employees
Retirement Plan (the "US PENSION PLAN"), to the knowledge of the Company
there has been no material adverse change in the financial conditions of such
plan from the date of the most recent audited financial statements included
in the Filed Company SEC Documents to the date of this Agreement, assuming
for such purpose that there has been no change in the discount rate used for
purposes of valuing the liabilities of such plan from the discount rate
applied in such financial statements. No liability under Title IV of ERISA
(other than for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) has
been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer" plan (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA), currently or formerly maintained by
any of them or by any Commonly Controlled Entity, except for any such
liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company
Pension Plans has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, nor has any
waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code been requested. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary,
any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of the Company
Benefit Plans, including the Company Pension Plans, or any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any Company
Benefit Plan or trust created thereunder, or any agents of the foregoing, has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) that would be reasonably expected to subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of the Company Benefit Plans, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator of any
Company Benefit Plan or trust created thereunder to the tax or penalty
on prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 of the Code or to
the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or to any other liability for
breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA, except for any such prohibited
transactions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Company Pension Plan
or related trust has been terminated during the last five years, nor has
there been any "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA),
other than an event for which the 30-day notice period has been waived, with
respect to any Company Pension Plan since January 1, 2004,     19  and
no notice of a reportable event will be required to be filed in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability that has not been
satisfied in full as a result of a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal" (as each such term is defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA) during the past six years from any "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.   (d) With respect
to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan, whether
or not subject to ERISA, such Company Benefit Plan is either funded through
an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefits fund" (as
defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) or it is unfunded.   (e) Other than
payments or benefits that may be made to the persons listed in Section
3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a "PRIMARY COMPANY
EXECUTIVE"), no amount or other entitlement that could be received (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the
Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event) by
any Participant who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in final
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) (each, a "DISQUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL")
under any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or other
compensation arrangement currently in effect would be an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no such
Disqualified Individual is entitled to receive any additional payment (E.G.,
any tax gross-up or any other payment) from the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any other person in the event that the excise tax required by
Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such Disqualified Individual. The
Company has provided Parent with calculations performed in 2004 by Hewitt
Associates of the estimated amounts of compensation and benefits that could
be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) by
certain Primary Company Executives as a result of a transaction of the nature
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other
event), and the "base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
for certain Primary Company Executives, in each case as of the date specified
in such calculations and in accordance with the assumptions made by Hewitt
Associates as set forth in such calculations. To the knowledge of the
Company, the Company provided true and complete compensation and benefit
information and data to Hewitt Associates necessary to perform
such calculations, which information and data was correct in all material
respects as of the date provided by the Company to Hewitt Associates.   (f)
The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will
not (either alone or in combination with any other event) (i) entitle any
Participant to any additional compensation, severance, termination, change in
control or other benefits or any benefits the value of which will
be calculated on the basis of any of the Transactions (alone or in
combination with any other event), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of any compensation, severance or other benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company     20  Benefit Agreement, or
(iii) trigger the forgiveness of indebtedness owed by any Participant to the
Company or any of its affiliates.   (g) Since January 1, 2004, and through
the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has received notice of, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
(i) material pending termination proceedings or other suits, claims (except
claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit
Plans), actions or proceedings against or involving or asserting any rights
or claims to benefits under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement or (ii) pending investigations (other than routine inquiries) by
any Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement, except for any such suits, claims, proceedings or
investigations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All contributions,
premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with the Company Benefit
Plans or Company Benefit Agreements that are required to have been made by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been timely made, accrued or
reserved for, except for failures to make, accrue or reserve for any such
contributions, premiums and benefit payments that, individually or aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any liability or obligations, including under or on account of a Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of
persons to provide services to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
treating such persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except for any such
liabilities or obligations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (i) The
Agreement for the Trust for Maytag Corporation Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plans dated as of October 1, 2003 (the "TRUST Agreement"), by
and between the Company and KeyBank National Association, and each Plan
(as such term is defined in the Trust Agreement) has been amended to provide
that no funding shall be required in connection with the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.  
(j) Except for any items that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i)
all Non-U.S. Benefit Plans have been maintained in accordance with their
terms and all applicable legal requirements, (ii) if any Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan is intended to qualify for special tax treatment, such Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan meets all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) the fair market
value of the assets of each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be funded, the
liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be
funded, and the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to provide for the
accrued benefit obligations under each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.     21  
SECTION 3.12. LITIGATION. There are no suits, actions or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (and the Company is not aware of any
basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, nor are there any Judgments outstanding against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.13.
COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
their relevant personnel and operations are in compliance with all applicable
Laws, including those relating to occupational health and safety, except for
such failure to be in compliance as, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written communication
during the past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the
Company or a Company Subsidiary is not in compliance in any material respect
with any applicable Law, except for such failure to be in compliance as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have in effect all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, authorizations,
operating certificates, franchises, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities (collectively, "PERMITS"), necessary or advisable for them to own,
lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses
as now conducted, except for such Permits the absence of which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and there has occurred no violation of,
default (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both)
under, or event giving to others any right of termination, amendment or
cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, any such
Permit, except for any such violations, defaults or events that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There is no event which, to the knowledge of the
Company, would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification of any such Permit, except
for any such events that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. This
Section 3.13 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the
subject of Section 3.09.   SECTION 3.14. LABOR MATTERS. Since January 1,
2004, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has experienced any
material labor strikes, union organization attempts, requests for
representation, work slowdowns or stoppages or disputes due to labor
disagreements, and to the knowledge of the Company there is currently no such
action threatened against or affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are each, and since January 1, 2002
have each been, in compliance with all applicable Laws with respect to labor
relations, employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, human rights, pay equity and workers
compensation, except to the extent that the failure to comply with any such
Law, individually or in the aggregate,     22  would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and is not, and since
January 1, 2002 has not, engaged in any unfair labor practice that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor practice charge
or complaint against the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case, before the National
Labor Relations Board or any comparable Federal, state, provincial or foreign
agency or authority, except for any such charges or complaints that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No grievance or arbitration proceeding
arising out of a collective bargaining agreement is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except for any such grievances or proceedings that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.15. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   (a)
Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance with
all Environmental Laws, and neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received any written communication from a
Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is in violation of, or has liability under, any Environmental
Law.   (b) (i) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have
obtained and are in compliance with all material permits, licenses and
governmental authorizations pursuant to Environmental Law (collectively
"ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS") necessary for their operations as presently
conducted, (ii) all such Environmental Permits are valid and in good standing
and (iii) since January 1, 2003, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has been advised in writing by any Governmental Entity of any
actual or potential change in the status or terms and conditions of any
Environmental Permit.   (c) Except for such matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, there are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or any of the

Subsidiaries or against any person whose liabilities for such Environmental
Claims the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has, or may have,
retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of law.   (f)

at, under or about property owned, operated or leased by the  Company or any
Company Subsidiary is non-friable or encapsulated and in  good condition
according to the generally accepted standards and practices  governing such
material, and its presence or condition does not violate or  otherwise
require abatement or removal pursuant to any applicable  Environmental
Law.   (h) Except for such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, 
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, 
(i) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has retained or 
assumed, either contractually or by operation of law, any liabilities or 
obligations that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of any 
Environmental Claim against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, 
and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, no Environmental Claims are 
pending against any person whose liabilities for such Environmental Claims

OF PARENT AND SUB   Parent and Sub, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Company that:   SECTION 4.01. ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND
POWER. Each of Parent and Sub (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized,
other than defects in such organization, existence or good standing that,
individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (b) has full corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, other than such corporate power and authority,
franchises, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.02. SUB; EQUITY INTERESTS. (a)

creditors\' rights, and to general equity principles.   SECTION 4.04. NO
CONFLICTS; CONSENTS. (a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Sub
of this Agreement, do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without the lapse of time or
the giving of notice, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights

information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the     27  Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the Company\'s stockholders or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.   SECTION 4.06. BROKERS. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs and Co. and
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., any fees and expenses of which will be paid by

SECTION 4.07. FINANCING. (a) Sub has received and accepted and agreed to a
commitment letter dated May 19, 2005 (the "DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER") from the
lenders party thereto (collectively, the "LENDERS") relating to
the commitment of the Lender to provide the debt financing required to
consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, to
refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company and to pay related
fees and expenses. The debt financing required to consummate the Merger, to
refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company and to pay related
fees and expenses is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "DEBT
FINANCING".   (b) Sub has received and accepted and agreed to commitment
letters dated May 19, 2005 (the "EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTERS" and, together
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "COMMITMENT LETTERS") from certain
persons (collectively, the "EQUITY INVESTORS") relating to the commitment of
the Equity Investors to provide the cash equity required to consummate the
Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, to refinance certain
existing indebtedness of the Company and to pay related fees and expenses.
The cash equity required to consummate the Merger, to refinance certain
existing indebtedness of the Company and to pay related fees and expenses is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "CASH EQUITY" (the Cash
Equity, together with the Debt Financing, is collectively referred to as the
"FINANCING"). Complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters
have been provided to the Company.   (c) Subject to its terms and
conditions, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, shall provide Sub with acquisition financing at the Effective Time
sufficient to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company and to
pay related fees and expenses.   (d) As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters are valid, binding and in full force and effect and no
event within the direct control of Parent or Sub has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or an incurable failure to satisfy a condition
precedent on the part of Parent or Sub under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters, other than any such default or breach that has been
waived by the Lenders or the     28  applicable Equity Investor, as the
case may be, or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent or Sub to the
satisfaction of the Lenders or such Equity Investor, as the case may be. As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent or Sub has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement.   SECTION
4.08. SOLVENCY. Assuming that the statements in the following clauses (a)
through (d) are true and correct with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, immediately prior to the Effective
Time without reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and

which Parent and Sub propose to conduct the business of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries after the Effective Time, immediately after
the Effective Time (a) the fair value of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall exceed the
amount of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, contingent or otherwise, (b) the present fair

material respect the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.
Parent and Sub acknowledge that neither Parent nor Sub shall have any
approval rights under this Section 5.01(d). The Company acknowledges that any
such consultation shall not constitute a waiver by either Parent or Sub of
any rights it may have under this Agreement and that neither Parent nor Sub
shall have any liability or responsibility for any actions of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective directors or officers with
respect to matters that are the subject of such consultations.   SECTION
5.02. NO SOLICITATION. (a) During the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and continuing until 12:01 a.m. (EST) on June 18, 2005 (the
"SOLICITATION PERIOD END DATE"), the Company and any officer, director
or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") of, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary shall be permitted to (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii)
directly or indirectly participate in discussions or negotiations regarding,
and furnish to any person information with respect to, and take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover
Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) the Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to,
provide to any person any non-public information (other than any immaterial
non-public information) with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
without first entering into a customary confidentiality agreement with such
person that is not less restrictive of the other party than the
Confidentiality Agreement (excluding the provisions of the eleventh paragraph
thereof) and (B) the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided
to such person or its Representatives which was not previously provided to
Parent.   (b) Subject to Section 5.02(c), from the Solicitation Period End
Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary to, and the Company shall direct
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary not to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or
(iii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect
to, or knowingly take any     34  other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.02(b) by the Company. Subject to Section 5.02(c), on
the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion,
negotiation or other action permitted by Section 5.02(a) conducted by the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.   (c) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 5.02(b), from the Solicitation Period End Date and
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in
response to an unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal which did not result
from a breach of Section 5.02(b), or a solicited Company Takeover Proposal
which did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a), and which, in either
case, the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and financial advisors, may reasonably be expected to lead to
a transaction (i) more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such proposal, and this Agreement (including any
amendment to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger in effect as of the
date of such determination) and (ii) that is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 5.02(e), (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the
other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (excluding the provisions of
the eleventh paragraph thereof) and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with such person and its Representatives regarding any
Company Takeover Proposal; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that is provided to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided to
Parent.   (d) Subject to Section 8.01(e), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any
such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement
relating to any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so withdraw or modify its
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement would be inconsistent with
the    35  Company Board\'s exercise of its fiduciary duties, the Company
Board or any committee thereof may withdraw or modify its recommendation of
the Merger and this Agreement.   (e) The Company promptly shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or, following
the Solicitation Period End Date, any inquiry with respect to or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the identity
of the person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the
material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry.   (f)
Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to
the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.   (g) For
purposes of this Agreement:   "COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means (i) any
proposal or offer for a  merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization
or other business  combination involving the Company, (ii) any proposal for
the issuance by  the Company of over 20% of its equity securities as
consideration for the  assets or securities of another person or (iii) any
proposal or offer to  acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20%
of the equity  securities or consolidated total assets of the Company, in
each case other  than the Merger.   "SUPERIOR COMPANY PROPOSAL" means any
proposal made by a third party  to acquire all or substantially all the
equity securities or assets of the  Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer, a merger, a consolidation,  a liquidation or dissolution, a
recapitalization, a sale of all or  substantially all its assets or
otherwise, (i) on terms which the Company  Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company\'s  outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, to be more favorable from a  financial point of view to the holders
of Company Common Stock than the  Merger, taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal,  and this Agreement (including any proposal
by Parent to amend the terms of  this Agreement and the Merger) and (ii) that
is reasonably capable of being  completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other  aspects of such proposal; PROVIDED that the
Company Board shall not so  determine that any such proposal is a Superior
Company Proposal prior to  the time that is 48 hours after the time at which
the Company has complied  in all material respects with Section 5.02(e) with
respect to such  proposal.     36   ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS   SECTION 6.01. PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT; STOCKHOLDERS
MEETING. (a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement

the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy

Approval there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and,
if required by the SEC, mail to its stockholders such amendment or
supplement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders as promptly as
practicable after filing with or, if necessary, clearance from the SEC.

(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in
such document or response all reasonable comments proposed by Parent.   (b)

Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company
Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger as
permitted by Section 5.02(d). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the
Company Board of its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger.

properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report,   
37  schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws
and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. All information exchanged
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality

Holdings L.L.C. (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").   SECTION 6.03.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to

effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions (other than the Financing), including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals

any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions (other
than the Financing) and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the
Company Board shall (i) use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement and (ii) if any state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this
Agreement, use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and
the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other Transactions. Parent
and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters,

in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to obtain the proceeds of
the Financing and shall not permit any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters if
such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (x) reduces the aggregate
amount of the     38  Financing, (y) amends the conditions to the
drawdown of the Financing or (z) is adverse to the interests of the Company,
in each case, in any material respect. The Company shall also use reasonable
best efforts to assist and cooperate with Parent and Sub in connection with
their efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing, including
providing reasonably required information relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the financial institution or institutions providing
the Debt Financing and executing and delivering, and causing the Company
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver, customary certificates, legal opinions
(which may be reasoned, if counsel reasonably believes it cannot give the
opinion otherwise) or other documents and instruments relating to guarantees,
the pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no obligation of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any such certificate, document or instrument shall
be effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, the Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall
consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other

counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry

that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.   (c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of Sub, shall adopt this Agreement.   (d) In the event that the Closing
shall occur, simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company
or the Surviving Corporation to repay in full (i) any Obligations (as such
term is defined in the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of October 31,
2002 (as amended, the "LOAN AGREEMENT"), among the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Bank of America, National Association, as administrative agent,
and the other lenders named therein) outstanding under the Loan Agreement and
(ii) any obligations outstanding under the ABL Facility (as such term is
defined in Section 5.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), in each case,
to the extent required to avoid a     39  default thereunder (it being
understood and agreed that, if the aggregate of such Obligations and
obligations exceed a certain amount, the Closing may not occur as a result of
the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter not being satisfied,
in which case Parent shall have no obligations under this Section
6.03(d)).   SECTION 6.04. STOCK OPTIONS; ESPP. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions as shall
provide for the following:   (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding
Company Employee Stock  Options, whether vested or unvested, to provide that
the Company Employee  Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, as  of the Effective Time, become fully vested and
exercisable solely for the  right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration; and   (ii) make such other changes to the Company
Stock Plans as the Company  and Parent may agree are appropriate to give
effect to the Transactions.   (b) As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee of
the Company Board administering the ESPP), shall adopt such resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to provide that with respect to
the ESPP, (i) participants may not increase their payroll deductions or
purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement and
(ii) no purchase period shall be commenced after the date of this
Agreement.   (c) All amounts payable to holders of the Company Employee
Stock Options pursuant to Section 6.04(a) shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.   (d) In this Agreement:  
"COMPANY EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION" means any option to purchase Company  Common
Stock (exclusive of rights under the ESPP) granted under the  Company Stock
Plans or otherwise.   "COMPANY SAR" means any stock appreciation right
linked to the price  of Company Common Stock and granted under the Company
Stock Plans or  otherwise.   "COMPANY STOCK PLANS" mean the 2002 Employee
and Director Stock  Incentive Plan, the 1998 Non-Employee Directors\' Stock
Option Plan, the  2000 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the 1996 Employee Stock

40   SECTION 6.05. BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Subject to all applicable collective
bargaining agreements, from the Effective Time through December 31, 2005,
except as set forth below, Parent shall either (A) maintain or cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Company Benefit Plans (other than
plans providing for the issuance of Company Common Stock or based on the
value of Company Common Stock) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of
this Agreement or (B) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who remain employed
by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries benefits (other than
benefits under plans providing for the issuance of Company Common Stock or
based on the value of Company Common Stock) that, taken as a whole, are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time (it being understood and agreed that
modifications to Company Benefit Plans that have been announced to
participants or planned and otherwise disclosed to Parent but not yet
implemented as of the Effective Time shall be taken into account for purposes
of the foregoing). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that, with
respect to service through December 31, 2005, it shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain the employer matching contribution
component of the Maytag Corporation Salary Savings Plan without reduction;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such employer matching contributions shall be made in
cash following the Effective Time). Parent and the Company agree and
acknowledge that consummation of the Transactions shall constitute a "change
of control" for purposes of each applicable Company Benefit Plan and Company
Benefit Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit
Plan in accordance with the terms thereof and with applicable Law, so long as
they comply with the requirements of this Section 6.05.   (b) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect
on the date of this Agreement), all the Company Benefit Plans and Company
Benefit Agreements disclosed in Sections 3.10(b) and 3.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (subject, in each case, to the right of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate a Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof and with
applicable Law). For purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
(other than benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans) under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries providing benefits
after the Effective Time to any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such plans,
collectively, the "NEW PLANS"), each such employee shall be credited with all
years of service for which such employee was credited before the Effective
Time under any comparable Company Benefit Plans, except where such crediting
would lead to a duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the
extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such plans,    
41  collectively, the "OLD PLANS"), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any such
employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions, limitations and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependent (to the extent such exclusions, limitations and actively-
at-work requirements were waived or satisfied as of the Effective Time under
the corresponding Old Plan) and (iii) all deductibles, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents under any Old Plan during the portion of the plan year of
such Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins shall be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.   (c) Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue the
employment of any specific person.   (d) The Company may provide up to
$3,000,000 as a retention pool (the "RETENTION POOL") for the purposes of
retaining the services of employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES") who are key employees. The Chief Executive
Officer of the Company shall determine, subject to approval by (i) the
Company Board and (ii) Parent (in the case of (ii), such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld), the Company Employees eligible to receive retention
awards from the Retention Pool (each, a "RETENTION BONUS") and any criteria
for payment of the Retention Bonus, and shall determine the final allocation
of payments from the Retention Pool. Any Retention Bonus shall be intended to
retain the services of the recipient through, and shall be payable (if such
recipient still remains employed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
at such time) on, the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 6.05(d), no Primary Company Executive shall receive any award
or payment from the Retention Pool.   (e) Parent shall cause the Company to
continue to maintain the Company\'s 2005 annual bonus plans set forth in
Section 6.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "BONUS PLANS") for the
2005 calendar year and to pay Company Employees the aggregate of all bonus
amounts due under such Bonus Plans pursuant to the objective formulae set
forth therein (including formulae approved thereunder by the Company or the
Company Board, or a committee thereof, prior to the date of this Agreement
and previously provided to Parent), based on the performance of the Company
and its operating units, without adjusting such total for individual
performance; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall determine, in its sole
discretion, the portion of such aggregate bonus amounts that may be payable
to any particular Company Employee so long as such bonus amounts are fully
paid in the aggregate to the Company Employees. Company performance in
respect of calculations to be made under the Bonus Plans for the 2005
calendar year shall be calculated without taking into account any
expenses or      42  costs related to or arising out of the
Transactions or any non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be
expected to have been incurred had the Transactions not occurred.   (f)
From the Effective Time through the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
(i) Company Employees below the level of Director shall continue to
participate in the Maytag Corporation Separation Pay and Benefits Plan
(the "SEVERANCE PLAN"), (ii) Company Employees at the levels of Director and
above shall be eligible for severance benefits pursuant to the plan set forth
in Section 6.05(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iii) none of
the Severance Plan, the Maytag Corporation Separation of Employment Plan, or
the plan set forth in Section 6.05(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be amended in any manner adverse to the Company Employees.   SECTION 6.06.
INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the Company\'s obligations to
indemnify the current or former directors or officers of the Company for acts
or omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective
Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of
this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company By-laws
or individual indemnity agreements, and such obligations shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
the terms of the Company Charter, the Company By-laws and such individual
indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions. Parent shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to
advance funds for expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending a
civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding relating to the indemnification
obligations referenced in the immediately preceding sentence in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount
if it shall be ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to the
indemnification referenced in the immediately preceding sentence.   (b) For
a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or
related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(such 300% amount, the "MAXIMUM PREMIUM"). If such insurance coverage cannot
be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of
the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors\' and officers\' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to Parent that the Maximum
Premium is $3,696,000.     43    SECTION 6.07. FEES AND EXPENSES. (a)
Except as provided in this Section 6.07, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.   (b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $40,000,000 if:
(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); (ii) (A)
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, any person makes a Company Takeover
Proposal or amends a Company Takeover Proposal made prior to the date of this
Agreement, (B) this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (and prior to such termination the Company
shall have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement) or 8.01(b)(iii) (but only if a Company Takeover
Proposal is publicly announced at or prior to the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c) and (C) within
12 months after the date of such termination the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions
contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal; or (iii) the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e). Any fee due under this Section
6.07(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of
termination of this Agreement (except that in the case of termination
pursuant to clause (ii) above, such payment shall be made on the date of
execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such
transactions). Solely for the purposes of Section 6.07(b)(ii), the
term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 5.02(g), except that all references to "20%" shall be changed to
"40%". The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
6.07(b) are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts
due pursuant to this Section 6.07(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for
the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(b), the Company shall pay to
Parent interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(b) from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date
of actual payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made, together with reasonable legal
fees and expenses incurred in connection with such suit. It is expressly
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the fee
referred to in this Section 6.07(b) on more than one occasion.   (c) The
Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub, in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$12,500,000, for all their out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(c);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such reimbursement shall be required if
the Company is otherwise obligated to make a payment to Parent pursuant to
Section 6.07(b). Such reimbursement, if any, shall be paid upon demand
following such termination.     44   SECTION 6.08. PUBLIC
ANNOUNCEMENTS. Each of Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with each
other before issuing, and, to the extent reasonably feasible, provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law,
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange.   SECTION 6.09. TRANSFER TAXES. All stock
transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and other
similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes)
("TRANSFER TAXES") incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid
by either Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate
with Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes, including supplying in a timely manner a
complete list of all real property interests held by the Company that are
located in New York State and any information with respect to such property
that is reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns.   SECTION 6.10.
RIGHTS AGREEMENTS; CONSEQUENCES IF RIGHTS TRIGGERED. The Company Board shall
take all further actions (in addition to those referred to in Section
3.05(c)) requested in writing by Parent in order to render the Company Rights
inapplicable to the Merger and the other Transactions. Except as approved in
writing by Parent, the Company Board shall not (i) amend the Company Rights
Agreement, (ii) redeem the Company Rights or (iii) take any action
with respect to, or make any determination under, the Company Rights
Agreement. If any Distribution Date or Share Acquisition Date occurs under
the Company Rights Agreement at any time during the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall make such
adjustment to the Merger Consideration as the Company and Parent shall
mutually agree so as to preserve the economic benefits that the Company and
Parent each reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as a
result of the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.  
SECTION 6.11. STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to any
Transaction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   SECTION 6.12. RESIGNATION OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each member of the Company Board
to execute and deliver a letter, which shall not be revoked or amended prior
to the Effective Time, effectuating his or her resignation as a director of
the Company Board effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
SECTION 6.13. OTHER ACTIONS BY PARENT. Parent shall not, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its affiliates not to, take any action
that would      45  reasonably be expected to result in any condition
to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied.   ARTICLE
VII   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   SECTION 7.01. CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY\'S
OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER. The respective obligation of each party to
effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the
Closing Date of the following conditions:   (a) STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. The
Company shall have obtained the Company Stockholder Approval.   (b)
ANTITRUST. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
Merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have expired.
Any Consents and filings required prior to the Closing under any foreign
Antitrust Law, the absence of which would reasonably be expected to (i) have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) result in a criminal
violation, shall have been obtained or made.   (c) NO INJUNCTIONS OR
RESTRAINTS. No restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal
restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be
in effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to asserting this condition, subject
to Section 6.03, each of the parties shall have used its reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry of any such injunction or other order and to
appeal as promptly as possible any such judgment that may be entered.   (d)
SOLVENCY OPINION. Each of Parent and the Company shall have received a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
the Company, from a nationally recognized financial advisor that is regularly
involved in the business of valuing companies and rendering solvency opinions
and that is selected by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to Parent
opining that both immediately prior to the Effective Time and on a pro forma
basis immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions (including the Debt Financing and the application
of the proceeds therefrom), the Company and the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, shall be solvent (as such term is customarily defined in
such solvency opinions).   SECTION 7.02. CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF
PARENT AND SUB. The obligations of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger are
further subject to the following conditions:   (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement that are qualified as to Company Material Adverse Effect shall
be true and correct and those not so qualified shall be true and correct in
all material respects, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing      46  Date as though made on the Closing Date, except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier
date (in which case such representations and warranties qualified as to
Company Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct, and those not so
qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of
such earlier date). Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of the Company by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer
of the Company to such effect.   (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE
COMPANY. The Company shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior
to the Closing Date, and Parent shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer and the chief financial
officer of the Company to such effect.   (c) NO LITIGATION. There shall not
be pending any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity or any
other person, in each case that has arisen after the date of this Agreement
and has a reasonable likelihood of success, relating to the Merger or any
other Transaction and which (i) is reasonably likely to result in the Company
or any Company Subsidiary being required to pay material damages or other
amounts or (ii) otherwise is reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. As a result of any judgment or settlement in respect of any
such suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity or any other
person, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall have paid, or
shall be required to pay, (i) any material damages or other amounts or (ii)
any amount that otherwise would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (d) ABSENCE OF COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.
Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or in any Filed Company
SEC Document, since the date of this Agreement there shall not have been any
event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (e) FINANCING. Sub shall have
received the proceeds of the Debt Financing from the Lenders.   SECTION
7.03. CONDITION TO OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY. The obligation of the Company
to effect the Merger is further subject to the following conditions:   (a)
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties of Parent
and Sub set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to Parent Material
Adverse Effect shall be true and correct and those not so qualified shall be
true and correct in all material respects, as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date, except to the
extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
earlier date (in which case such representations and warranties qualified as
to Parent Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct, and those not so
qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as of
such     47  earlier date). The Company shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer of Parent to
such effect.   (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND SUB. Parent and
Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations required to
be performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date,
and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent
by an executive officer of Parent to such effect.   (c) FINANCING. Sub
shall have available at the Closing cash in an amount sufficient for the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Paying Agent, concurrently with the
Closing, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock to be
converted into the right to receive cash proceeds pursuant to Section
2.01(c).   SECTION 7.04. FRUSTRATION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS. None of the
Company, Parent or Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.01, 7.02 or 7.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such party\'s failure to use reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as required by and subject
to Section 6.03.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  
SECTION 8.01. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval:   (a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Sub and the
Company;   (b) by either Parent or the Company:   (i) if the Merger is not
consummated on or before December 15,  2005 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"), unless the
failure to consummate the Merger  is the result of a willful and material
breach of this Agreement by  the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that  the passage of such period shall be tolled for any
part thereof during  which any party shall be subject to a nonfinal order,
decree, ruling  or action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the  consummation of the Merger;   (ii) if any Governmental Entity issues
an order, decree or ruling  or takes any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining or  otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree,
ruling or  other action shall have become final and nonappealable; or    
48   (iii) if, upon a vote thereon at a duly held meeting to obtain  the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Stockholder Approval is  not
obtained;   (c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in
any  material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants 
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would 
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 
7.02(b), and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured by the Outside Date 
(provided that neither Parent nor Sub is then in wilful and material breach 
of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);  
(d) by Parent:   (i) if the Company Board or any committee thereof withdraws
or  modifies, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, or publicly proposes  to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, its  approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger, fails to  recommend to the
Company\'s stockholders that they give the Company  Stockholder Approval or
approves or recommends, or publicly proposes  to approve or recommend, any
Company Takeover Proposal; or   (ii) if (A) the Company or any of its
officers, directors,  employees, representatives or agents knowingly takes
any of the  actions that would be proscribed by Section 5.02 but for the 
exceptions therein allowing certain actions to be taken pursuant to  Section
5.02(c) or the second sentence of Section 5.02(d), unless such  action has
only an immaterial effect on Parent, or (B) the Company  gives Parent the
notification contemplated by Section 8.05(b)(iii);   (e) by the Company
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder  Approval in accordance with
Section 8.05(b); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the  Company shall have complied
with all provisions thereof, including the  notice provisions therein; or  
(f) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform in  any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants 
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would 
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 
7.03(b), and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured by the Outside Date 
(provided that the Company is not then in wilful and material breach of any 
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement).   SECTION
8.02. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than
Section 3.17,      49  Section 4.06, the last sentence of Section
6.02, Section 6.07, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall
survive such termination, and except to the extent that such termination
results from the willful and material breach by a party of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement.   SECTION
8.03. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall
be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by
the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.   SECTION 8.04. EXTENSION;
WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by the Company
shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.  
SECTION 8.05. PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, EXTENSION OR WAIVER. (a)
A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver under this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require
in the case of Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, to
the extent permitted by law, the duly authorized designee of its Board
of Directors. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall
not require the approval of the stockholders of the Company.   (b) The
Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e) only if (i)
the Company Board has received a Superior Company Proposal, (ii) in light of
such Superior Company Proposal a majority of the disinterested directors of
the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify its recommendation of
the Merger and this Agreement would be inconsistent with the Company
Board\'s exercise of its fiduciary duty under applicable Law, (iii) the
Company has notified Parent in writing of the determinations described in
clause (ii) above, (iv) at least five business days following receipt by
Parent of the notice referred to in clause (iii) above, and taking into
account any revised proposal made by Parent since receipt of the notice
referred to in clause (iii) above, such Superior Company Proposal remains a
Superior Company Proposal and a majority of the disinterested directors of
the Company has again made the determinations referred to in clause (ii)
above, (v) the Company is in compliance, in all material respects, with
Section 5.02, (vi) the Company has previously paid the fee due under Section

EXHIBIT A   RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION   OF   SURVIVING
CORPORATION    ARTICLE I   The name of the corporation (hereinafter
called the "Corporation") is "Maytag Corporation".   ARTICLE II   The
address of the Corporation\'s registered office in the State of Delaware is
1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801. The name
of the registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.  
ARTICLE III   The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.   ARTICLE IV   The total number
of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation shall have authority
to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock having the par value of $1.00 per
share. The holders of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation shall have no
preemptive right to purchase or have offered to them for purchase any shares
of Common Stock or other equity securities issued or to be issued by the
Corporation.   ARTICLE V   The number of directors of the Corporation
shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors of
the Corporation. Any director or the     2   entire Board of Directors
of the Corporation may be removed, with or without cause, at any time by the
holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then entitled to vote at
an election of directors or by written consent of the stockholders.  
ARTICLE VI   In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
upon it by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly
authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation.  
ARTICLE VII  Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the
Corporation so require, the election of directors of the Corporation need not
be by written ballot.   ARTICLE VIII   To the fullest extent from time to
time permitted by law, no person who is or was a director of the Corporation
shall be personally liable to any extent to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his fiduciary duty as a
director. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.   ARTICLE IX   SECTION
1. Any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or of
any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
for which he served as such at the request of the Corporation, shall in
accordance with the provisions of this Article IX hereinafter set forth be
indemnified by     3  the Corporation against expenses (including
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation), to which he was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a
party, by reason of his being or having been a director or officer of the
Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise. The director or officer shall be entitled to such
indemnification if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendre or its equivalent shall not, in itself, create a
presumption that the person did not meet the standards of conduct set forth
herein. In the case of any action or suit by or in the right of the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, such director or officer
shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement
of such action if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation,
and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable
to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of
Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such     4  person is fairly
and reasonably entitled to such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery
or such other court shall deem proper.   SECTION 2. To the extent that a
present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful
on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding
referred to in Section 1 of this Article IX, or defense of any claim, issue
or matter therein, he shall be entitled, as of right, to indemnification as
provided in this Article IX. Any indemnification under this Article IX
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation as authorized in
the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or
former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 of this Article IX.
Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director
or officer at the time of such determination (1) by a majority vote of the
directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even
though less than a quorum; (2) by a committee of such directors designated by
a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum; (3) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel (who shall not be regular counsel of the Corporation and shall
have generally recognized competence to advise upon the matter) in a written
opinion; or (4) by the stockholders.   SECTION 3. Expenses (including
attorneys\' fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding of the character described in this Article IX may be paid by the
Company in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of    
5  an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such
amount if it shall be ultimately determined that he is not entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX.   SECTION 4. The rights of
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in or granted pursuant
to this Article IX shall be in addition to any other rights to which any such
director or officer may be entitled as a matter of law, under any contract,
bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while holding such office, and in the event of such
person\'s death, such rights shall extend to his heirs and
legal representatives. The foregoing rights shall be available whether or not
such person continues to be a director or officer at the time of incurring
or becoming subject to such liability or expenses and whether or not the
claim asserted against him is based on matters which antedate the adoption of
this Article IX.   SECTION 5. The Corporation shall have power to purchase
and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted
against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article
IX.   SECTION 6. For purposes of this Article IX, references to
"the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation,
any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or     6  merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the
same position under the provisions of this Article IX with respect to such
constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.   SECTION
7. For purposes of this Article IX, references to "other enterprises" shall
include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include
any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit
plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article IX.

stockholders less than a quorum. At such adjourned meeting at which the
requisite amount of voting stock shall be represented any business may be

any stockholder, the vote upon any question before the meeting, shall be by

Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the
election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.   7. Written notice of

stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the board of directors
pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the whole board of
directors. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the
stockholders may be postponed by resolution of the board of directors
upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such
meeting of stockholders. This Bylaw 9 may not be amended or rescinded except
by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the stock of
the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, at any regular
or special meeting of the stockholders if notice of the proposed alteration
or amendment be contained in the notice of meeting.   10. Business

been appointed to act or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
officer appointed to act or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
officer of the corporation presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before

affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the stock of the
corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, at any regular or
special meeting of the stockholders if notice of the proposed alteration or
amendment be contained in the notice of the meeting.   13. The directors

such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.
Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of this Bylaw 14A to the
contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the
board of directors of the corporation is increased and there is no public
announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size
of the increased board of directors made by the corporation at least 70 days
prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year\'s annual meeting, a
stockholder\'s notice required by this Bylaw 14A shall also be considered
timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by
such increase, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal
executive offices of the corporation, in Newton, Iowa, not later than the
close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the corporation. The officer of the corporation
presiding at the annual meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts so
warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with
the provisions of this Bylaw 14A, and if he should so determine, he should
so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be
disregarded.   Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors
may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
elected pursuant to the corporation\'s notice of meeting (a) by or at the
direction of the board of directors or (b) provided that the board of
directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by
any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time
of giving of notice provided for in this Bylaw 14A, who shall be entitled to
vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in
this Bylaw 14A. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of
stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the board,
any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be),
for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation\'s notice of
meeting, if the stockholder\'s notice required by the first paragraph of this
Bylaw 14A shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive
offices of the corporation not earlier than the 90th day prior to such
special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
60th day prior to such special meeting or the     6  10th day following
the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special
meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected
at such meeting.   No person shall be eligible for election as a director of
the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth
in these Bylaws.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Bylaw 4 and this Bylaw
14A, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in Bylaw 4 and
this Bylaw 14A. Nothing in Bylaw 4 and this Bylaw 14A shall be deemed to
affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation\'s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE   15. There
may be an executive committee of two or more directors designated by
resolution passed by a majority of the whole board. Said committee may
meet at stated times, or on notice to all by any of their own number. During
the intervals between meetings of the board such committee shall advise with
and aid the officers of the corporation in all matters concerning its
interests and the management of its business, and generally perform such
duties and exercise such powers as may be directed or delegated by the board
of directors from time to time. The board may delegate to such committee
authority to exercise all the powers of the board excepting power to amend
the Bylaws, while the board is not in session. Vacancies in the membership of
the committee shall be filled by the board of directors at a regular meeting
or at a special meeting called for that purpose.   16. The executive
committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same
to the board when required.   COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS   17. Directors
who as officers or employees of the corporation receive compensation from it
shall not receive any stated compensation for their services as directors;
but by resolution of the board reasonable compensation for attendance at
board meetings may be allowed and paid.   Directors who do not receive
compensation from the corporation for employment with it in the capacity of
an officer or employee shall be allowed and paid such stated compensation as
may be fixed by the board of directors; and such directors shall be
reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their
duties or services as director, the amount thereof to be allowed and paid by
resolution of the board.   Nothing herein contained shall be construed as
precluding a director from serving the company in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor.     7    18. Members of special or
standing committees may be allowed and paid compensation for their services
as such, and expenses incident thereto, in such amounts as from time to time
are fixed and allowed by the board of directors.   MEETINGS OF THE BOARD

as has been provided by the director; special meetings shall be called by the
chairman of the board, the president or secretary in like manner and on like
notice on the written request of a majority of the directors then in office.
A special meeting may be held without notice if all the directors are present
or, if those not present waive notice of the meeting in writing, either
before or after such meeting.   22. At all meetings of the board, four
directors, but not less than one-third of the total number of directors,
shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any
meeting at which there is a quorum, shall be the act of the board of
directors, except as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.   OFFICERS   23. The
officers of this corporation shall be chosen by the directors and shall be a
president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, controller, and such

he or the president shall be the chief executive officer of
the corporation.   24. The board of directors, at its first meeting after
each annual meeting of stockholders, shall elect the corporate officers.  
25. The board may appoint such other officers and agents as it shall
deem necessary, who shall hold their offices for such terms and shall

to time by the board.   26. The salaries of the officers of the corporation
shall be fixed from time to time by the board of directors; provided that in
the case of officer members of the board of directors their salaries may be

methods: (i) by a salary committee of not less than three members appointed,
by a resolution passed by a majority of the whole board of directors, from
among the members of the board of directors who are not officers of
the corporation, or (ii) by a salary committee composed of all members of the
board of directors who are not officers of the corporation, such committee to
act by a majority of its members. None of the officers of the corporation
shall be prevented from receiving a salary by reason of the fact that he is
also a member of the board of directors; but an officer who shall also be a
member of the board of directors shall not have any vote in a determination
by the board of directors of the amount of salary that shall be paid to
him.   27. The officers of the corporation shall hold office until
their successors are chosen and qualify in their stead. Any officer elected
or appointed by the board of directors may be removed at any time by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole board of directors.
