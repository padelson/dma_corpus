 ** This Agreement and Plan of Merger **(this " _Agreement_ ")
is made and entered into as of June 25, 2018, by and among **B io-Techne
Corporation**, a Minnesota corporation (" _Parent_ "), **E nzo Merger Sub,
Inc.**, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("

defined in _Exhibit A_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and the
Securityholders' Representative are occasionally referred to herein as the
"parties."

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

 **W hereas**, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger
(as that term is defined in the DGCL) whereby Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL (the "
_Merger_ "). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist,
and the Company will become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent;

  



  

 **W hereas**, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders that the parties consummate the Contemplated Transactions, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein; and

  

 ** **

  

 **W hereas**, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions.

  

 ** **

  

 **N ow, Therefore**, in consideration of the mutual covenants, conditions and
agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

 **(a) Merger ****of** **Merger Sub** **into the** **Company**. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time (as defined below), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease. The Company will
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "). The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

 **(b) Effective Time**. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent will cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the Certificate of
Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger will become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

   

  



  

 **(c) Closing**. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to the Closing contained in _Section_ _6_ , the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as practicable (but not
later than three Business Days) after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the Closing contained in _Section_ _6_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), unless another date
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (other than the Securityholders'
Representative). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." All proceedings to be taken, all

and restated, such Company Charter will be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein and by applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

 **(ii)** At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company will be amended
and restated so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub, and,

until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal
Requirements.

  



  

 **(iii)** Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective
Time, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist solely

Merger Consideration, as adjusted by the Final Adjustment Amount.

  



  

 **(d) Updated ****Consideration Spreadsheets**. Promptly following
reasonable notice from Parent in connection with (i) any scheduled
distribution of any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the WC Escrow Fund
or the Securityholders' Representative Amount to the Company Securityholders,
(ii) payment of any Payable Adjustment payable to the Company Securityholders
pursuant to _Section_ _1.5(d)_ _,_ or (iii) payment of any Earn-out Payments
to the Company Securityholders, the Securityholders' Representative will
deliver to Parent (and to the Paying Agent and Escrow Agent, as appropriate)
an updated Consideration Spreadsheet that reflects such contemplated
distributions of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the WC Escrow Fund or the
Securityholders' Representative Amount, any Payable Adjustment payable to the
Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section_ _1.5(d)_ , or payment of any
Earn-out Payments to Company Securityholders (and Moelis and Company for any
Moelis Delayed Fee).

  



  

 **(e) Accuracy of ****Consideration Spreadsheets**. The Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet is the sole responsibility of the Company, and each
updated Consideration Spreadsheet is the sole responsibility of the
Securityholders' Representative, and the Company and the Securityholders'
Representative hereby agree that neither Parent, nor any of Parent's
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation following the Closing), will
have any responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions or inaccuracies
therein. Parent, its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation following
the Closing), and Paying Agent will be entitled to rely on the accuracy of the
Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, and any updated Consideration Spreadsheet
in all respects, and Parent's obligation to make any payments pursuant to this
_Section 1_ will be deemed fulfilled to the extent that Parent makes such
payments in accordance with the foregoing.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(f) Indemnity Escrow Amount** **;** **WC Escrow Amount**. At the
Closing, (i) an amount in cash equal to $25,000,000 of the Closing Merger
Consideration (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ") will be withheld and
deposited by Parent in a separate account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "
and the amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account, inclusive of any interest,
dividends, distributions or other amounts earned thereon from time to time,
the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") and (ii) an amount in cash equal to
$500,000 of the Closing Merger Consideration (the " _WC Escrow Amount_ ") will
be withheld and deposited by Parent in a separate account (the " _WC Escrow
Account_ " and the amount in the WC Escrow Account, inclusive of any interest,
dividends, distributions or other amounts earned thereon from time to time,
the " _WC Escrow Fund_ ") with the Escrow Agent. The Indemnity Escrow Amount
and the WC Escrow Amount will be held and distributed as provided in the
Escrow Agreement and as described herein. The Indemnity Escrow Amount and the
WC Escrow Amount will be held solely for the purpose of securing the post-
Closing obligations of the Company Securityholders expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Subject to a reserve to the extent of any pending claims determined
in accordance with _Section_ _8.1(e)(ix)_ , the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement will provide for (i) a partial release of
an amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account on the 15-month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Preliminary Escrow Release Date_ ")
such that the Indemnity Escrow Fund is equal to the lesser of (A) the then
current Indemnity Escrow Fund balance and (B) $10,000,000 _plus_ an amount
equal to all unresolved claims on the Preliminary Escrow Release Date, and
(ii) a final release of the Indemnity Escrow Account on the third anniversary
of the Closing Date (the " _Final Escrow Release Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no amounts subject to unresolved claims will be released
until such claims are resolved in accordance with _Section_ _8.1(e)(ix)_. The
Escrow Agreement will also provide for the release of amounts in the WC Escrow
Account as provided for in _Section 1.5(d)_. Any release and payment of
amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account or the WC Escrow Account to
Company Securityholders will be made in accordance with the Consideration
Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this Agreement. All fees, costs and
expenses of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Account, the
WC Escrow Account, and of the Paying Agent with respect to the Exchange Fund
will be paid 50% by the Company Securityholders (which amount will be a
Specified Transaction Expense) and 50% by Parent. The Indemnity Escrow Amount
and the WC Escrow Amount will be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Indemnity Escrow Amount and the
WC Escrow Amount will be held as a trust fund and will not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and will be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
Receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval will constitute approval of the
Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements contemplated thereby, including
the placement of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the WC Escrow Amount in
escrow.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(g) Securityholders' Representative Amount**. At the Closing, an
amount in cash equal to $500,000 of the Closing Merger Consideration (the "
_Securityholders ' Representative Amount_") will be deposited by Parent in an
account designated in writing by the Securityholders' Representative to Parent
no less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Securityholders ' Representative Account_"). The Company Securityholders will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Securityholders' Representative
Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Securityholders'
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Securityholders' Representative will not be
liable for any loss of principal of the Securityholders' Representative Amount
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders' Representative will hold the Securityholders Representative
Amount separate from its corporate funds, will not use the Securityholders'
Representative Amount for its operating expenses or any other corporate
purposes, and will not voluntarily make the Securityholders' Representative
Amount available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the Securityholders' Representative's
responsibilities, the Securityholders' Representative will deliver any
remaining balance of the Securityholders' Representative Amount to the Paying
Agent (or the Surviving Corporation in respect of Withholding Options) for
further distribution to the Company Securityholders (in accordance with an
updated Consideration Spreadsheet). For tax purposes, the Securityholders'
Representative Amount will be treated as having been received and voluntarily
set aside by the Company Securityholders at the time of Closing.

  



  

 **(h) Deemed Liquidation Provisions**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the merger consideration payable by Parent hereunder shall be
allocated among the Company Securityholders to give effect to subsections 2.1
and 2.2 of the Certificate of Incorporation, after taking into account the
determination of the board of directors of the Company as provided for in
Section 2.3.4 of the Certificate of Incorporation, and the Company (with
respect to the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet) and the Securityholders'
Representative (with respect to each other Consideration Spreadsheet) shall
calculate each and every Consideration Spreadsheet in accordance therewith and
this Agreement.

  



  

 **1.5. Closing ****Date Adjustment**.

  



  

 **(a)** The Company will deliver to Parent the Company's good-faith
estimate of (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital_ ") and a good-faith estimate of the corresponding
Adjustment Amount and (ii) the Company Cash (the " _Estimated Company Cash_ ")
no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_ "). Such estimates will be based
on the Company's books and records, the good faith estimate of the management
of the Company and other information then available. Parent will have the
right to review the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement and
such supporting documentation or data of the Company as Parent may reasonably
request. If Parent does not agree with the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement, the Company and Parent will negotiate in good faith to
mutually agree on an acceptable Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and
Estimated Company Cash, and the Company will consider in good faith any
proposed comments or changes that Parent may reasonably suggest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure to include in the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital and/or the Estimated Company Cash any comments or changes
proposed by Parent, or the acceptance by Parent of the Estimated Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement, or the consummation of the Closing, will not
limit or otherwise affect Parent's remedies under this Agreement, including
Parent's right to include such changes or other changes in the Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement, or constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of
the accuracy of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and/or
Estimated Company Cash; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure of Parent
and the Company to reach such mutual agreement will not give any party the
right to terminate this Agreement, delay or prevent the Closing, or otherwise
fail to close the Contemplated Transactions, and the Estimated Closing Date
Net Working Capital and/or the Estimated Company Cash (i) delivered by the
Company or (ii) as agreed to by the Company and Parent will be the figures
used for purposes of determining the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the
Closing Merger Consideration.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b)** The Adjustment Amount used for the calculation of the Closing
Merger Consideration on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_
") will be based on the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital. Parent and
the Company acknowledge and agree that the exact Adjustment Amount and Company
Cash may not be known as of the Closing Date and that the Adjustment Amount
and Company Cash determined on the Closing Date may need to be adjusted
subsequent to the Closing Date on the basis set forth herein. Accordingly, no
later than 120 days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to
the Securityholders' Representative (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the
Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the Company
Balance Sheet, (ii) a determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
and the Company Cash, and (iii) a statement setting forth the determination of
the resulting Adjustment Amount and the Company Cash (the " _Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement_ "), which will be accompanied by a description in
reasonable detail of Parent's differences with the Company's determination of
the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and/or the Estimated Company
Cash. If Parent fails to deliver the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement within 120 days after the Closing Date, then, at the
Securityholders' Representative's election or absent manifest error or fraud,
the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Date Net Working Capital, and the Company
Cash will be deemed to be the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital, and the Estimated Company Cash,
respectively, as set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, and such amounts will be final and binding on the parties hereto
and the Indemnified Persons for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

 **(c)** The Securityholders' Representative and Parent will have the
right to review all records, work papers and calculations that are reasonably
necessary for the purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement, the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement. The Securityholders' Representative will have 45
days after Parent delivers the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement and
all of the aforementioned requested records, work papers and calculations in
which to notify Parent in writing (such notice, a " _Closing Date Net Working
Capital Dispute Notice_ ") of any discrepancy in, or disagreement with, the
items reflected on the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement (and
specifying the amount in dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such discrepancy or disagreement), and upon agreement by Parent
regarding the adjustment requested by the Securityholders' Representative, an
appropriate adjustment will be made thereto. If the Securityholders'
Representative does not deliver a Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute
Notice to Parent during such 45 day period, the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement will be deemed to be accepted in the form presented to the
Securityholders' Representative. If the Securityholders' Representative timely
delivers a Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice and Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative do not agree, within 15 days after timely
delivery of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice, to resolve
any discrepancy or disagreement therein, the discrepancy or disagreement will
be submitted for review and final determination by the Independent Accounting
Firm. The review by the Independent Accounting Firm will be limited to the
discrepancies and disagreements set forth in the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Dispute Notice, and the resolution of such discrepancies and
disagreements and the determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
and the resulting Adjustment Amount and Company Cash by the Independent
Accounting Firm must be (i) in writing, (ii) made in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the Company Balance Sheet, (iii) with
respect to any specific discrepancy or disagreement, no greater than the
higher amount calculated by Parent or the Securityholders' Representative, as
the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Parent or
the Securityholders' Representative as the case may be, (iv) made as promptly
as practical after the submission of such discrepancies and disagreements to
the Independent Accounting Firm (but in no event later than 30 days after the
date of submission), and (v) final and binding upon, and non-appealable by,
the parties hereto, the Indemnified Persons and their respective successors
and assigns for all purposes hereof, and not subject to collateral attack for
any reason absent manifest error or fraud. The fees, costs and expenses of
retaining the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated between the
Company Securityholders (which amount shall be funded first from the WC Escrow
Fund and, if the WC Escrow Fund is exhausted, second from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) and Parent in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportion will be based on the
amounts proposed by the Securityholders' Representative and Parent and
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm. Following the resolution of all
objections of the Securityholders' Representative regarding the manner in
which any item or items are treated on the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, by mutual agreement or Independent Accounting Firm, Parent will
prepare the final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement reflecting such
resolution and will deliver copies thereof to the Securityholders'
Representative and such final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement will
be the " _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_ ," and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the final Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement will be the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "
and the final Company Cash set forth in the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement will be the " _Final Company Cash_ ". The " _Payable
Adjustment_ " means the amount equal to (a) the Final Adjustment Amount
_minus_ the Estimated Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (b) the Final Company Cash
_minus_ the Estimated Company Cash.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(d)** If the Payable Adjustment is positive, then, within five
Business Days of the final determination of the Payable Adjustment, Parent
will deposit the Payable Adjustment and the Escrow Agent will deposit the
then-current balance of the WC Escrow Fund, in each case by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, (i) with the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Company Stockholders, Company Warrantholders and former
holders of Non-Withholding Options and (ii) with the Surviving Corporation for
further distribution to the former holders of Withholding Options through the
Surviving Corporation's payroll system in accordance with _Section_ _1.13(d)_
, with the amount of such distribution to the Company Securityholders to be in
accordance with an updated Consideration Spreadsheet prepared by the
Securityholders' Representative. If the Payable Adjustment is negative, then,
within five Business Days of the final determination of the Payable
Adjustment, Parent will receive the absolute value of the Payable Adjustment
by wire transfer of immediately available funds first out of the WC Escrow
Fund, and if the WC Escrow Fund is exhausted, second from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, and
any remaining available funds in the WC Escrow Fund will be deposited by the
Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) with the
Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Stockholders, the Company
Warrantholders, and former holders of Non-Withholding Options and (ii) with
the Surviving Corporation for further distribution to the former holders of
Withholding Options through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system in
accordance with _Section_ _1.13(d)_ , with the amount of such distribution to
the Company Securityholders to be in accordance with an updated Consideration
Spreadsheet prepared by the Securityholders' Representative.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(e) ** Except for fraud committed by one of the parties hereto, the
process set forth in this _Section_ _1.5_ shall be the exclusive remedy of
Parent and the Indemnified Persons for disputes related to the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Dispute Notice, and any amounts set forth therein, and no Person shall
have any right to seek Damages pursuant to _Section_ _8_ for matters
contemplated or covered by this _Section_ _1.5_.

  



  

 **1.6. Earn-out Payments**.

  



  

 **(a)** In addition to the Closing Merger Consideration, _Parent will
pay an additional aggregate amount up to $325,000,000 (the "_ _Earn-out
Amount_ _" ) as determined in accordance with __Schedule_ _1.6_. _The Earn-out
Amount_ shall be payable in accordance with one or more Consideration
Spreadsheets delivered by the Securityholders Representative. Any Moelis
Delayed Fee that becomes due as a result of any Earn-out Payment hereunder
shall only be deemed a Specified Transaction Expense at the time such Earn-out
Payment is paid to the Company Securityholders, and Parent shall make such
payment to Moelis and Company out of the applicable Earn-out Payment in
accordance with the amount set forth in an updated Consideration Spreadsheet
delivered by the Securityholders' Representative in connection with the
payment of such Earn-out Payment.

  



  

 **(b)** With respect to that portion of each Earn-out Payment payable to
the Company Securityholders in respect of the Company Shares, the Company
Warrants and the Non-Withholding Options, no more than 30 days after the
applicable Earn-out Payment Date, Parent will deposit, or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds for the benefit of and distribution to such Company Securityholders
within three Business Days thereafter, that portion of such Earn-out Payment
payable to such Company Securityholders in respect of the Company Shares, the
Company Warrants and the Non-Withholding Options, in each case as set forth in
the updated Consideration Spreadsheet.

  



  

 **(c) ** With respect to that portion of each Earn-Out Amount payable to
the Company Securityholders in respect of the Withholding Options, no more
than 30 days after the applicable Earn-out Payment Date, Parent will deliver
cash in an amount equal to the portion of such Earn-out Payment payable to
Company Securityholders in respect of such Withholding Options to the
Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for
further distribution to such Company Securityholders through the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system in accordance with _Section_ _1.13(d)_ no later
than the first regular payroll date occurring at least three Business Days
after such Earn-out Payment Date, in each case as set forth in the updated
Consideration Spreadsheet.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(d)** Other than with respect to any Damages arising from any breach
of, or inaccuracy in, _Section 2.14_ , Parent will have the right to offset
any Damages finally determined pursuant to the procedures and subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 8_ to be owed to Indemnified Persons,
subject to the limitations contained in _Section_ _8_ , against any Earn-out
Payment (or any portion thereof) or portion of the Rollover Amount owed under
this _Section_ _1.6_.

  



  

 **1.7. Transfer Taxes**. All transfer, documentary, recording and
other similar fees payable in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be paid 50% by the Company
Securityholders (which amount shall be treated exclusively as a Specified
Transaction Expense hereunder) and 50% by Parent. The party required to do so
under applicable Legal Requirements shall prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and
provide the other parties with a complete and correct copy thereof.

  



  

 **1.8. Treatment of ****Company Securities**.

  



  

 **(a) Conversion**. At and as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Company Securityholder, each Company Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive from Parent, and paid promptly (and in any event, within
three (3) Business Days following the later to occur of (x) the surrender of
the certificate representing such Company Share (each, a " _Company Stock
Certificate_ ") (or Lost Stock Affidavit) and a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and (y) the Effective Time), the consideration set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this _Section_ _1_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no consideration will be paid with respect
to any Company Share held in treasury of the Company and each Company Share
owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) each Dissenting Share will be converted into the
right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto
in accordance with the DGCL. For purposes of calculating the amount of the
Closing Merger Consideration payable to each Company Securityholder pursuant
to this _Section_ _1_ , all amounts payable in cash to such Company
Securityholder will be aggregated and rounded up to the nearest whole cent
(with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating the amounts
payable for all shares of each class of Company Shares held by such Company
Securityholder. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company
Shares, Company Warrants and Company Options will cease to have any rights
with respect to the Company Shares and Company Options represented thereby,
other than the right to receive the amounts provided in this _Section_ _1_ or,
with respect to the holders of Company Shares who properly perfect such
Company Securityholders' appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL, the right to exercise their appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL.

  



  

 **(b)** Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and, as
of the Effective Time, all such shares will constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares will remain
outstanding and evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

   

  



  

 **1.9. Surrender of ****Company Stock Certificates**.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Certificates
representing the Company Shares will cease to have any rights as shareholders
of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed
with respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Company Shares will be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate will be
canceled and will be exchanged as provided in this _Section_ _1.9_.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to each Company
Stockholder a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
(each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). At least two Business Days, but not
more than five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to
Parent properly completed and duly executed Letters of Transmittal, effective
as of the Effective Time and executed by Company Stockholders holding no less
than 90% of the voting power of the Company Shares as of the Closing
(including each of the ten largest holders of Company Shares as of the Closing
(it being agreed that for the purposes of such calculation each "holder of
Company Shares" shall be determined by aggregating all Company shares held by
all Affiliates of such holder)), together with the appropriate Company Stock
Certificate (or a Lost Stock Affidavit in lieu thereof). Following the
Effective Time, the holder of a Company Stock Certificate will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor payment of an amount equal to the applicable
amount set forth on the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, and the Company
Stock Certificate so surrendered will be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section _ _1.9_ , each Company Stock Certificate will
be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender an amount equal to the applicable amount set forth
on the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. If any Company Stock Certificate is
lost, stolen or destroyed, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate may provide (in lieu of such Company Stock Certificate) a
customary affidavit as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate (a " _Lost Stock Affidavit_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
owner of any such Company Stock Certificate will not be required to deliver a
bond.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders' Representative, the Paying Agent, or the Escrow Agent will be
liable to any Company Securityholder for any portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. Any Aggregate Merger
Consideration remaining undistributed to Company Securityholders immediately
prior to such time as such Aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the
Company Securityholders pursuant to this _Section_ _1_ would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

   

  



  

 **1.10. Dissenting Shares**.

  



  

 **(a)** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the
Effective Time, are held by a Company Stockholder exercising such Company
Stockholder's right to demand appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into or represent the
right to receive payment in accordance with _Sections_ _1.8_ and _1.9_ , and
such Company Stockholders will be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to such Company Stockholders in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such Company Stockholder's right of appraisal is not
perfected, or if such Company Stockholder's demand for payment is withdrawn
pursuant to Section 262(k) of the DGCL, as of the later of the Effective Time
or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the withdrawal of such
demand, such shares will automatically be converted into and will represent
only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares) payment in accordance with _Sections_
_1.8_ and _1.9_.

  



  

 **(b)** The Company will (i) give Parent prompt written notice of any
written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and of any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company will
not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any such demand unless Parent has consented in writing to such
payment or settlement offer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

 **1.11. Withholding Rights**. Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, as applicable, will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Securityholder such amounts as
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow
Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law; _provided_ , that other than with respect to amounts paid as
a bonus or in respect of Withholding Options or amounts related to a failure
to provide the deliverable described in _Section_ _1.3(b)(ix)_ , Parent shall
give the applicable Company Securityholder reasonable prior written notice of
any intention to so withhold and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to
take any necessary steps to minimize or eliminate any such withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company
Securityholder in respect of which such withholding and payment was made.

  



  

 **1.12. Termination of ****Exchange Fund**. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Securities
(other than the Withholding Options) six months following the final Earn-out
Payment Date will, upon demand by Parent, be delivered to Parent, and any
former holder of such Company Securities who has not previously complied with
the document delivery provisions of this _Section_ _1_ will be entitled, after
complying with such provisions of this _Section_ _1_ , and subject to any
escheat or similar laws, to receive from Parent payment of the applicable
portion of such undistributed amount with respect to such Company Securities.

  



  

   

  



  

 **1.13. Treatment of ****Company Options** ****.

  



  

 **(a)** Company Options will not be continued, assumed or substituted by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent as part of the Merger. Prior to the
Closing, the Company's board of directors will adopt appropriate resolutions
and will take all other actions necessary and appropriate to cause each
Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, to become fully vested and be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive (subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Option Termination Agreements) a cash payment with
respect thereto equal to the amount set forth on the Consideration
Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this _Section_ _1_ , less any
applicable withholding Taxes.

  



  

 **(b)** As of the Effective Time, all Company Options will become fully
vested, cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted in exchange for
such cancellation and extinguishment into the right to receive (i) promptly
after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the difference between the per share amount of the
Closing Cash Consideration payable in respect of a share of Company Common
Stock _minus_ the per share exercise price of such Company Option, (ii) a per
Company Share amount of the release of any Indemnity Escrow Amount, any WC
Escrow Amount or any Securityholders' Representative Amount, (iii) a per
Company Share amount of the Payable Adjustment payable to Company
Securityholders, and (iv) the portion of each Earn-out Payment, if any,
payable with respect to such Company Option in the manner provided in
_Section_ _1.6_.

  



  

 **(c)** As a condition to payment of any Aggregate Merger Consideration
to any holder of Company Options in respect of such holder's Company Options,
such holder will be required to sign a termination agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C-1_ (in respect of Withholding Options) or
_Exhibit C-2_ (in respect of Non-withholding Options) (an " _Option
Termination Agreement_ ").

  



  

 **(d)** In accordance with this Agreement and the Option Termination

of business following the date that any portion of any amount payable
hereunder becomes due (and, with respect to payments made as of the Closing,
if any, no later than the first regular payroll date occurring at least three
Business Days following the later to occur of (x) the execution and delivery
of an Option Termination Agreement, and (y) the Effective Time), the Surviving

 **(e) ** In accordance with _Section_ _1.15_ below, any portion of the

such Company Options. Any portion of any Earn-out Payment that becomes payable
with respect to any Withholding Option will be subject to withholding for
income and employment Taxes as of the applicable Earn-out Payment Date.

  



  

 **1.14. Securityholders' Representative**.

  



  

 **(a) ** By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the
approval of the Merger and the consummation of the Merger or participating in
the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive
the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each Company
Securityholder hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as his, her or its sole, exclusive, true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact following the Closing (the "
_Securityholders ' Representative_"), with full power of substitution to act
in such Company Securityholder's name, place and stead with respect to all
transactions contemplated by and all terms and provisions of this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement following the Closing, and
to act on such Company Securityholder's behalf in any dispute, litigation or
arbitration involving this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement following the
Closing, and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and
execute all such documents, on such Company Securityholder's behalf, as the
Securityholders' Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Paying Agent Agreement following the Closing, including the power: (i) to
execute and deliver this Agreement and any and all amendments, waivers or
modifications hereof; (ii) to waive any condition to the obligations of such
Company Securityholder to consummate the Contemplated Transactions; (iii) to
execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates and documents, and
to make representations and warranties therein, on behalf of such Company
Securityholder that the Securityholders' Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (iv) to direct the
Paying Agent or Escrow Agent to distribute (after payment of (A) any unpaid
expenses chargeable to the Company Securityholders or the Company prior to the
Closing in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and (B) amounts
payable by the Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section_ _1.5_ ), all
amounts payable to such Company Securityholder under the terms of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (v) with respect to any claims for
indemnification made by an Indemnified Person hereunder, agree to, object to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand litigation of
and comply with orders and awards of courts with respect to such claims; and
(vi) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of such
Company Securityholder as is assigned, delegated or charged to the
Securityholders' Representative or that the Securityholders' Representative
otherwise deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent
Agreement, as fully and completely as such Company Securityholder could do if
personally present. All such actions set forth or described in this _Section_
_1.14(a)_ will be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside this Agreement and
will be binding on the Company Securityholders.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b)** The appointment of the Securityholders' Representative is deemed
coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable, and Parent, its Affiliates
and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry,
upon any action of the Securityholders' Representative on behalf of the
Company Securityholders in all matters referred to herein. All notices
delivered by Parent or the Company (following the Closing) to the
Securityholders' Representative (whether pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the
benefit of the Company Securityholders will constitute notice to the Company
Securityholders. The Securityholders' Representative will act for the Company
Securityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the
manner the Securityholders' Representative believes to be in the best interest
of the Company Securityholders as a whole and consistent with its obligations
under this Agreement, but the Securityholders' Representative will not be
responsible to the Company Securityholders for any loss or damages it or they
may suffer by reason of the performance by the Securityholders' Representative
of its duties under this Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from
fraud by the Securityholders' Representative.

  



  

 **(c) ** If the Securityholders' Representative resigns or is otherwise
similarly unable to carry out its duties hereunder, then the Company
Securityholders with an aggregate Pro Rata Portion (as calculated as of
Closing) of at least 50.1% (the " _Requisite Company Securityholders_ ") will,
within five Business Days, appoint a new Securityholders' Representative. The
Requisite Company Securityholders may at any time, for any reason or no
reason, remove the Securityholders' Representative. If at any time there is
not a Securityholders' Representative and the Company Securityholders fail to
designate in writing a successor Securityholders' Representative within five
Business Days after receipt of a written request delivered by Parent to the
Requisite Company Securityholders requesting that a successor Securityholders'
Representative be designated in writing, then Parent may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a new Securityholders' Representative
hereunder.

  



  

 **(d) ** All actions, decisions and instructions of the Securityholders'
Representative taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the
Securityholders' Representative pursuant to this _Section_ _1.14_ will be
conclusive and binding upon each Company Securityholder, and no Company
Securityholder will have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same. By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger and the consummation of the
Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, each Company Securityholder will be deemed to have approved,
confirmed and ratified any action taken by the Securityholders' Representative
in the exercise of the power-of-attorney granted to the Securityholders'
Representative pursuant to this _Section_ _1.14(d)_ , which power-of-attorney,
being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and will survive the death,
incapacity or incompetence of each such Company Securityholder.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(e)** The Securityholders' Representative will not be liable to the
Company Securityholders for any act done or omitted in connection with the
Securityholders' Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto unless caused by fraud by the Securityholders'
Representative. The Securityholders' Representative shall not be liable for
any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Securityholders'
Representative will not have any fiduciary, agency or other duties to the
Company Securityholders and its only obligations will be as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. The Securityholders' Representative is serving in
that capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
liable for any of the obligations of the Company Securityholders hereunder,
and Parent and the Company agree that they will not look to the underlying
assets of the Securityholders' Representative for the satisfaction of any
obligations of the Company Securityholders (or any of them). The Company
Securityholders will severally, in accordance with each such Company
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion (and not jointly) indemnify and defend the
Securityholders' Representative and hold the Securityholders' Representative
harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including
the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Securityholders' Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholders' Representative,
the Securityholders' Representative will reimburse the Company Securityholders
the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable
to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Securityholders' Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Securityholders' Representative
from (i) the funds in the Securityholders' Representative Account, (ii) the
amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Company Securityholders and not
otherwise subject to a General Unresolved Claim, and (iii) from the Earn-out
Amount at such time as any such amount would otherwise be distributable to the
Company Securityholders; _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Securityholders' Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Company Securityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Securityholders' Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Securityholders' Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Company Securityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of the Company Securityholders set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Securityholders' Representative under this section. The
foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of
the Securityholders' Representative or the termination of this Agreement. In
the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder, the Securityholders'
Representative may, in its sole and reasonable discretion, refrain from taking
any action, unless the Securityholders' Representative receives written
instructions, signed by the Requisite Company Securityholders, that eliminate
such ambiguity or uncertainty.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(f) ** If (i) the Securityholders' Representative elects (1) to assume
and control the defense and/or management of any Third Party Claim at the
expense of Company Securityholders in accordance with _Section_ _8.1(f)_
hereof or (2) to take any other action under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement that may require the payment of amounts out of the Securityholders'
Representative Amount, including for any attorneys, accountants, auditors or
other advisors, and (ii) the Securityholders' Representative's good faith
estimate of the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the Securityholders'
Representative in connection with any such action exceeds the balance of the
Securityholders' Representative Amount, the Securityholders' Representative
may refrain from taking any such action until such time as the
Securityholders' Representative, upon seven days' notice to the Company
Securityholders, receives written commitments signed by the Requisite Company
Securityholders for payment of such expenses, in which case all Company
Securityholders will pay their Pro Rata Portion of such estimated expenses.
Any such initial notice by the Securityholders' Representative to the Company
Securityholders will include a statement of the balance of the
Securityholders' Representative Amount, the good faith estimate of the
reasonable expenses to be incurred by the Securityholders' Representative, the
amount by which the estimated expenses to be incurred exceed the balance of
the Securityholders' Representative Amount, and each Company Securityholder's
Pro Rata Portion of such excess expense amount. Each Company Securityholder
will deliver its Pro Rata Portion of any excess expense amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, using the wire instructions
identified in any such initial notice, no later than ten days following the
date on which the Securityholders' Representative gives such Company
Securityholder notice of the receipt of commitments signed by the Requisite
Company Securityholders for payment of such excess expenses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Company Securityholder will be required to make any
payments, individually or in the aggregate, pursuant to this _Section_
_1.14(f)_ in excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration previously received
by such Company Securityholder. Any amounts thus paid will increase the
balance of the Securityholders' Representative Amount. The Securityholders'
Representative may invest the Securityholders' Representative Amount as it
determines in its discretion.

  



  

 **1.15. Tax ****Treatment**. Absent a determination within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no party
hereto shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with the
following characterizations: (i) the portions of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
and the Earn-out Amount allocable to the Company Stockholders are intended to
be treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale
treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of
non-U.S., state or local law, as appropriate, and (ii) the portions of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Earn-out Amount allocable to Company
Optionholders are not intended to be compensation or wages, or subject to
withholding as such, unless and until such portions (or any part thereof) are
actually distributed to Company Optionholders.

  



  

 **1.16. Treatment of ****Company Warrants**.

  



  

 **(a)** Company Warrants will not be continued, assumed or substituted
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent as part of the Merger. Prior to the
Closing, the Company's board of directors will adopt appropriate resolutions
and will take all other actions necessary and appropriate to cause each
Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, to be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) a cash payment
with respect thereto equal to the amount set forth below at the time(s)
described herein. " _In-the-Money Warrant_ " means a Company Warrant with an
exercise price per share that is less than the aggregate per share amount of
merger consideration paid (including for purposes of the calculation as of the
Effective Time the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the WC Escrow Amount) to a
share of Company Common Stock under this Agreement through the applicable
date.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b)** As of the Effective Time, (x) all In-the-Money Warrants as of
the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
(i) promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which such Company Warrant was vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the difference between the per share
amount of the Closing Cash Consideration payable to a share of Company Common
Stock _minus_ the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant, (ii) a Pro
Rata Portion of the release of any Indemnity Escrow Amount, any WC Escrow
Amount or any Securityholders' Representative Amount, (iii) a per Company
Share amount of the Payable Adjustment payable to Company Securityholders, and
(iv) the portion of each Earn-out Payment, if any, payable with respect to
such Company Warrant in the manner provided in _Section 1.6_ ; and (y) all
other Company Warrants that only become In-the-Money Warrants after the
Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive an amount equal promptly after any such Company Warrant
becomes an In-the-Money Warrant (the " _Trigger Date_ ") to (i) an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Warrant was vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the difference
between the per share amount of merger consideration paid to a share of
Company Common Stock under this Agreement through the Trigger Date _minus_ the
per share exercise price of such Company Warrant, and, without duplication to
the amount payable pursuant to clause (y)(i) above, (ii) the portion of each
Earn-out Payment, if any, payable with respect to such Company Warrant in the
manner provided in _Section 1.6_.

  



  

 **(c)** In accordance with this Agreement and the Warrant Termination
Agreements, as promptly as reasonably practicable in the ordinary course of
business following the date that any amounts are payable hereunder to Company
Warrantholders, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent, cash in an amount equal to such amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for further distribution by the Paying Agent to the Company
Warrantholders in accordance with the updated Consideration Spreadsheet.

  



  

 **2. Representations and Warranties Regarding the Company**.
Except as disclosed in a disclosure schedule of even date herewith delivered
by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_
"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, as of
the date hereof and, if and only if the Closing occurs, as of the Closing,
that:

  



  

 **2.1. Organization, Standing and Power**. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business, and is in good
standing (if such concept is applicable in the relevant jurisdiction), in each
jurisdiction where the operation of the Company's current business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each jurisdiction where the Company is
qualified to do business is set forth in _Section_ _2.1_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The Company has posted in the Data Room true and correct
copies of the Company Charter and bylaws of the Company, in each case as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

 **2.2. Company Subsidiaries**. With the exception of the Subsidiaries
set forth in _Section_ _2.2_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Company Subsidiaries_ "), the Company does not have any Subsidiaries. Each of
the Company Subsidiaries is wholly owned by the Company, duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and
has the requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company
Subsidiaries is in good standing (if such concept is applicable in the
relevant jurisdiction), in each jurisdiction where the operation of such
Company Subsidiary's current business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to so qualify would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has posted in the Data Room true and correct copies of the
organizational documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

 **2.3. Power and Authority**.

  



  

 **(a)** The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which the Company is a
party or signatory, for the Company to consummate the Closing and the
Contemplated Transactions and to perform its obligations hereunder and

all Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party or signatory, and
the consummation by the Company of the Closing and the other Contemplated
Transactions, including the Merger, have been duly authorized and approved by
the Company's board of directors, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions, other than the Required Stockholder Approval,
which will be solicited prior to Closing pursuant to _Section_ _5.7_. The
Required Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of Company Shares necessary to approve this Agreement and approve the
Contemplated Transactions (to the extent stockholder approval is required).
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating
to creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law.

  



  

 **(b)** The Company's board of directors has (i) determined that the
Merger is advisable to and in the best interests of the Company Stockholders,
(ii) approved this Agreement, including the Certificate of Merger, (iii)
resolved to recommend the adoption of this Agreement to the Company
Stockholders and to seek such adoption as described in _Section_ _5.7_ , and

"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination," "fair
price" or other form of anti-takeover laws or regulations of any jurisdiction
or any anti-takeover provisions in the Company Charter or the Company's bylaws
to the Company, the Merger, this Agreement, or the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

 **2.4. Capitalization**.

  



  

 **(a)** The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company as of the date hereof is set forth in _Section_ _2.4_ _(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company Securities constitute all of the
issued and outstanding equity securities in the Company as of the date hereof.
All outstanding Company Shares (a) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, (b) are, to the Knowledge of the Company, free of any
Encumbrances, and (c) were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights or
rights of first refusal created by statute, the Company Charter or bylaws of
the Company or any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound. With the exception of the Company Options, and the Company Warrants set
forth in _Section_ _2.4_ _(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and except
as set forth in _Section_ _2.4_ _(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there are no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements that
are outstanding as of the date hereof to which the Company is a party or by
which it is bound, obligating the Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase
or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed,
any Company Shares or obligating the Company to grant, or enter into any
option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement regarding Company
Shares. Except for the Company Charter and the Company Equity Incentive Plan,
and except as set forth in _Section _ _2.4_ _(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no contracts, commitments or agreements relating to the
voting or the transfer of, or restrictions on or a requirement for the Company
to purchase or sell, Company Shares (x) between or among the Company and any

between or among any Company Securityholders.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b) ** All outstanding securities of the Company have been offered and
issued in compliance with all applicable securities laws, including the
Securities Act and all applicable "blue sky" laws. Any cancellation, re-grant
or other re-pricing or amendment transaction, with respect to options or other
rights to purchase Company Shares, was properly authorized and conducted in
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

  



  

 **2.5. Noncontravention**. Subject to the Required Stockholder Approval
and compliance with the HSR Act, and except as set forth in _Section_ _2.5_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company does not constitute, and the consummation by the Company of the
Contemplated Transactions will not (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) result in, (a) a breach or violation by the Company of, or a default
by the Company under, any provision of the Company Charter or bylaws of the
Company, as amended to date; (b) a termination, or breach or violation by the
Company of, or an event of default by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
under, or result in the loss of any benefit of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
increased payments or acceleration of a third party under, or result in the
creation of any Encumbrance on any asset or property owned by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or require any consent of a third party under, any
material Permit held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any Material
Contract; or (c) a breach or violation by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary of any Legal Requirement applicable to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, or any of its properties or assets. Other than as required to
comply with the HSR Act, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
required to be obtained or made by the Company in order for the Company to
execute and deliver this Agreement or for the Company to consummate the
Closing or the Contemplated Transactions, except the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

  



  

 **2.6. Governmental Authorizations**. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have at all times maintained each material federal, state,
county, local or foreign Governmental Authority consent, license, permit,
grant, approval or other authorization (" _Permits_ ") required for the
operation by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries of their respective
businesses, and all of such Permits obtained by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received written notice from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the revocation, material limitation or termination
of any Permit. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in material
compliance with the terms of all Permits.

  



  

   

  



  

 **2.7. Financial Statements; Internal Controls**.

  



  

 **(a) ** Attached as _Section_ _2.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are (i) the unaudited consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and
shareholders' equity and statements of cash flows of the Company as of and for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, (ii) the unaudited consolidated
balance sheets and the unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash
flows of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016,
and (iii)(1) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Company (the "
_Company Balance Sheet_ ") as of May 31, 2018 (the " _Company Balance Sheet
Date_ ") and (2) the unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash
flows for the five-month period ended on the Company Balance Sheet Date
(collectively, the " _Company Financial Statements_ "). The Company Financial
Statements (A) are consistent in all material respects with the books and
records of the Company; (B) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except
that the unaudited Company Financial Statements do not contain footnotes and
are subject to normal year-end adjustments) applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered; and (C) fairly present in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP the financial position, results of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the dates indicated therein, subject to normal year-end
adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the unaudited Company
Financial Statements. The statements of income included in the Company
Financial Statements do not contain any items of special or nonrecurring
income or any other income not earned in the ordinary course of business
required to be disclosed separately in accordance with GAAP, except as
expressly specified in the applicable statement of operations or notes
thereto. The books of account of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
accurately reflect in all material respects the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' items of income and expense and all assets and liabilities and
accruals that properly should have been reflected therein in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby except as
disclosed in the Company Financial Statements. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have provided or made available to Parent copies of all material
written correspondence with their independent certified accountants since
January 1, 2016.

  



  

 **(b) ** Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintains a
system of internal controls over financial reporting that provides reasonable
assurance that (i) records are maintained in reasonable detail and accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively; (ii) receipts and
expenditures and other transactions are executed in accordance with the
authorization of management; (iii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for the assets and liabilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, respectively; and (iv) there is prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that would affect the Company's
consolidated financial statements. No significant deficiency or material
weakness was identified in management's assessment of internal controls as of
December 31, 2017, nor has any such deficiency or weakness since been
identified.

  



  

   

  



  

 **2.8. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities**. Neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has, or has incurred, any material liability or
obligation of any nature (whether direct or indirect, matured or unmatured, or
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), except (a) as disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule; (b) as reflected, reserved against or otherwise
accounted for on the Company Balance Sheet; (c) performance or payment
obligations that are unmatured, unliquidated, or contingent pursuant to the
contracts, commitments, instruments and other agreements and documents
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or approved by Parent in writing
after the date hereof in accordance with _Section_ _4_ or otherwise entered
into in the ordinary course of business (other than any obligations arising
from a breach or failure to comply by the Company with any obligations
contained therein at any time prior to the Effective Time); (d) liabilities or
obligations (other than obligations for borrowed money or in respect of
capitalized leases entered into after the Company Balance Sheet Date) incurred
after the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business (none
of which are material in nature or amount); or (e) those incurred in
connection with the execution of this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and/or the Contemplated Transactions, including the Specified
Transaction Expenses. In the event that a Third Party Claim involving the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is brought following the Closing, the mere
existence of such claim shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of
this _Section_ _2.8_ on the grounds that the existence of such claim following
the Closing means that the matters underlying such claim by definition
constituted undisclosed, indirect, unmatured, unaccrued, unasserted,
contingent or similar liabilities as of the Closing or any time prior thereto.

  



  

 **2.9. Absence of Certain Developments**. Except as set forth on
_Section_ _2.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from December 31, 2017
until the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have conducted their respective business only in the ordinary course of
business (other than actions taken in connection with the execution of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and/or the Contemplated
Transactions); and (b) there has not been any Company Material Adverse Effect.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from December 31, 2017 until
the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has taken any action that, had it been taken after the date of
this Agreement, would be prohibited by the terms of _Section_ _4.1_.

Company Employee Plan to reimburse any employee for any income or excise Tax

 **(i)** Except as provided in _Section_ _2.24_ _(i)_ of the Company

compensatory payment (including golden parachute, bonus or benefits under any
Company Employee Plan); or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefits or increase the amount of compensation due to any such
employee or service provider. No benefit payable or that may become payable by
the Company pursuant to any Company Employee Plan in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of or arising under
this Agreement is reasonably expected to constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) subject to the
imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the deduction
for which would be disallowed by reason of Section 280G of the Code. Subject
to employee consent with respect to any employment agreement or offer letter,
no condition exists that would prevent the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan that is
sponsored and maintained solely by the Company without liability to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, respectively (other than for benefits
accrued at the time of termination). The Company and the Company Subsidiaries

under the laws of its state of incorporation, with the requisite corporate
power to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being

action for the dissolution, liquidation or insolvency of Parent. Parent is the

Merger Sub (as applicable) is a party or signatory, and the consummation of
the Closing and the other Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Parent and Merger Sub (as applicable), and no other authorization or consent
of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective shareholders is necessary. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, and,
assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
other parties hereto, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating
to creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law.

  



  

 **3.3. Noncontravention**. Neither the execution and delivery by Parent

Merger Sub; (b) require on the part of Parent or Merger Sub any registration,
declaration or filing with, or any permit, order, authorization, consent or

restriction on Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to execute and deliver this
Agreement or consummate the Closing or the other Contemplated Transactions (a
" _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ "); (c) conflict with, result in a breach
of, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, result in the acceleration of obligations under, create in any party
any right to terminate or modify, or require any notice, consent or waiver
under, any contract or agreement to which Parent is a party or by which Parent
is bound, except for (i) any conflict, breach, default, acceleration or right
to terminate or modify that would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any notice, consent or waiver the
failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (d) violate any Legal Requirement
applicable to Parent or any of its properties or assets, except for any
violation that would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; or (e) render Parent insolvent or unable to pay its debts as
they become due.

compliance that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. There is no litigation, action, suit, proceeding,
arbitration or, to knowledge of Parent, investigation, pending by or before a
Governmental Authority or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which Parent or its
Subsidiaries is otherwise a party, that would reasonably be expected to result

Sub acknowledges that (a) the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Securityholders, and their respective representatives, do not make any
representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or
budgets delivered to or made available to Parent or Merger Sub of future

flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or the future business and operations of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) any other information or documents made
available to Parent or Merger Sub or their counsel, accountants or advisors

connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby), except as expressly
set forth in _Section_ _2_ __ hereof and in the Letters of Transmittal, Option

neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied or will rely upon any of the
information described in subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of clause (a) above or
any other information, representation or warranty, except those
representations or warranties set forth in _Article II_ hereof and in the
Letters of Transmittal, Option Termination Agreements, and Warrant Termination
Agreements delivered in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, in
negotiating, executing, delivering, and performing this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub understand and agree that
they are acquiring the Company through the Merger in the condition the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries are in at the Effective Time based upon Parent's
and Merger Sub's own inspection, examination and determination of all matters
related thereto, and without reliance upon any express (except those

Agreements delivered in connection with the Contemplated Transactions) or

orally or otherwise, made by or on behalf of or imputed to the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Securityholders' Representative or any Company
Securityholder, or any representative thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this _Section_ _3.7_ shall prevent or preclude Parent

the information contained in previous public disclosures made by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to
the contrary, following execution hereof, the Securityholders' Representative
shall be permitted to, after the public announcement of the Merger, publicly
announce that it has been engaged to serve as the Securityholders'
Representative in connection with the Merger as long as such announcement does
not disclose any of the other terms of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated herein.

  



  

 **(b) ** The terms of that certain Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated
January 24, 2017, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") are hereby incorporated herein by reference and will continue in
full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the parties and its representatives may make such disclosures
as required by the terms of this Agreement without being in breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will nonetheless continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

 **(c)** From and after the date hereof, the Securityholders'
Representative will not, and will cause its directors, officers, employees,
Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose,
reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person (other than to the Company
Securityholders and its and their directors, partners, managers, officers,
employees, Representatives and Affiliates), or use or otherwise exploit for
their own benefit or for the benefit of anyone, any Confidential Information
(as that term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement). The
Securityholders' Representative will not have any obligation to keep
confidential (or cause its directors, officers, employees, Representatives and
Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information if and to the
extent that disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable Legal
Requirements or such information is otherwise publicly available; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that disclosure is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, the Securityholders' Representative will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, provide Parent and the Company
with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that
the applicable party may seek an appropriate protective order; _provided_
_further_ , disclosure may be made or information used only to the extent any
information is reasonably necessary for enforcing the rights of the Company
Securityholders or Securityholders' Representative arising out of this
Agreement or defending against assertions by Parent or any other Indemnified
Person as disclosed to any Governmental Authority or other involved party (
_e.g._ , opposing counsel, expert witnesses, investigators) in connection with
any dispute resolution proceedings involving a dispute between Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company Securityholders or the Securityholders'
Representative, on the other hand, arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

 **5.3. Efforts; Government Approvals and Further Assurances**.

  



  

 **(a)** Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to _Section_ _5.3_ _(b)_ , each of Parent, Merger
Sub, and the Company will execute and deliver such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such additional actions as any other party
may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm, or evidence the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will: (i)
make any filings and give any notices required to be made or given by such
party in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent required to be
obtained by such party in connection with this Agreement, the consummation of
the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and
the Company will pay 50% of any filing fee under the HSR Act and other
Antitrust Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will promptly
deliver to the other a copy of each such filing made (other than filings made
pursuant to the HSR Act), each such notice given and each such consent
obtained during the Pre-Closing Period, it being understood that delivery of
such filings, notices and consents exclusively to the outside counsel of such
other party will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this
_Section_ _5.3_ _(a)_. The initial filings pursuant to the HSR Act will be
made by Parent and the Company within five Business Days following the
Agreement Date and the parties agree to file for early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act.

  



  

 **(b)** The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals necessary for their execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company will use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by
such party with any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the
consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company hereby
covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to secure prompt
termination of any waiting periods imposed by the HSR Act and other Antitrust
Laws and to comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the
HSR Act to provide information, documents or other materials requested by any
Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent will (A) give the other
party prompt notice of the commencement of any legal proceeding by or before
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the consummation of
the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) keep the
other party informed as to the status of any such legal proceeding. The
Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted by either of them in connection with any legal
proceeding under or relating to national security matters.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(c) ** For the purposes of this _Section_ _5.3_ , "reasonable best
efforts" of Parent will not require (nor will anything in this _Section_ _5.3_
or otherwise in this Agreement require) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action that would prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries of any portion of the business or assets
of Parent, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries, or compel Parent, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries,
or any of Parent's Subsidiaries, to dispose of, hold separate or license any
portion of the business, assets or Intellectual Property of Parent, the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of Parent's Subsidiaries,
respectively, in each case as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In no event will Parent, the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of Parent's Subsidiaries be obligated to propose or agree
to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree or
hold separate order, to make any divestiture or to accept any operational
restriction or limitation. With regard to any Governmental Authority, the
Company will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, without
Parent's prior written consent in Parent's sole discretion, discuss or commit
to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter its business or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise discuss, take or commit to take
any action that limits Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or Parent's
ability to retain any of Parent's, the Company's, or the Company Subsidiaries'
respective businesses, product lines or assets or otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent has the unilateral right to determine whether or not the
parties will litigate with any Governmental Authority to oppose any
enforcement action or remove any court or regulatory orders impeding the
ability to consummate the Closing. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the obligations of Parent, its Subsidiaries and Merger Sub hereunder will
not include any requirement to defend any proceeding challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Closing beyond the Outside Date.

  



  

 **(d) ** Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall use best efforts to
obtain the MA License as promptly as possible following the date hereof, and
the Company shall reasonably cooperate with all efforts of Parent to obtain
the MA License.

  



  

 **5.4. Tax ****Matters**.

  



  

 **(a) Cooperation on ****Tax** **Matters**. Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by another party, in connection with the filing of (i)
any Tax Return or amended Tax Return with respect to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date, (ii) audit, or (iii) litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will include the retention
and (upon the other party's reasonable request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and the Securityholders' Representative will, as applicable, (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Parent or the Company, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (ii) give the other parties reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if any other party so requests, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, will allow the other parties to take possession of such books
and records. Parent and the Securityholders' Representative further agree,
upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company Subsidiaries or Parent that could be
imposed (including with respect to the Contemplated Transactions).

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b) Tax Returns**.

  



  

 **(i) Pre-** **Closing Tax** **Returns**. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries will prepare and file all Tax Returns relating to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, that are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date, which Tax Returns will be prepared in accordance with
past practices and customs. The Company will provide Parent with copies of
such Tax Returns that are income or other material Tax Returns.

  



  

 **(ii) Post-** **Closing Tax** **Returns**. Parent will prepare and file
(or cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare and file) all Tax Returns
relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns to the extent relating to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period will be prepared in accordance with the Company's and
the Company Subsidiaries' past practices and customs except as otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirement. In the event that the Taxes
reflected on such Tax Returns are reasonably likely to form the basis for a
claim of indemnification pursuant to _Section_ _8.1(b)_ , Parent will provide
such Tax Returns relevant to such claim of indemnification to the
Securityholders' Representative for review and comment at least 35 days prior
to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, will make reasonable changes
consistent with all applicable Legal Requirements to such Tax Returns as
requested by the Securityholders' Representative, and will not file any such
Tax Returns without the consent of the Securityholders' Representative, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With
respect to a Tax Return for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date but required to be filed after the Closing Date by Parent pursuant to
this section, Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall provide
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay on or before five days
from the due date of such Tax Return all amounts shown as due and payable on
such Tax Return (except to the extent (on a dollar for dollar basis) such
amounts were taken into account in calculating Closing Date Net Working
Capital or Company Change in Control Payments, in each case, as finally
determined hereunder). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) to
the extent applicable Tax laws so permit, the parties will treat or elect to
treat the taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries as terminating on
the Closing Date, (ii) any income Tax deduction arising from the bonuses,
option cashouts, restricted stock units, or other compensation and transaction
expenses payments funded with the Aggregate Merger Consideration or made by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be allocable to the taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (or the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date with respect to a Straddle Period), and
(iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall make a timely election under
Revenue Procedure 2011- 29, 2011-18 I.R.B. 746, to apply the seventy percent
(70%) safe-harbor to any expenses that are "success based fees" as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f).

  



  

   

  



  

 **(c) Tax ****Audits and Contests**.

  



  

 **(i)** Unless Parent has previously received notice from the
Securityholders' Representative of the existence of any Tax Contest (as
defined below), Parent will, or will cause the Company to, promptly notify the
Securityholders' Representative of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits
or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or a Straddle Period for which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or the Company Securityholders may be liable under this Agreement (such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that no failure to give such notice will relieve the
Company Securityholders of any liability hereunder except to the extent, if
any, that the rights of the Company Securityholders with respect to such claim
are materially and actually prejudiced thereby. Except with respect to income
Tax Returns (or information Tax Returns related to income Taxes) for taxable
periods of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date, Parent will have
the authority to represent the interests of the Company and will have control
of the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Contest; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Securityholders' Representative will be entitled to
participate in such Tax Contest at the Company Securityholders' expense and
Parent will not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax
Contest that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, or the Company Securityholders for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or to form the basis for an indemnification claim pursuant to
_Section 8_ without the written consent of Securityholders' Representative,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
Securityholders' Representative will have the authority, at the Company
Securityholders' expense, to represent the interests of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, and the Company Securityholders and will have control of
the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Contest to the extent
that such Tax Contest involves Tax Returns (or information Tax Returns)
related to income Taxes or Taxes in the nature of Taxes on net income for
taxable periods of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries ending on or
before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will be entitled
to participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense and the Securityholders'
Representative will not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such
Tax Contest that is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of the
Company or Parent for any taxable period (or portion thereof) occurring after
the Closing Date without the written consent of Parent, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

 **(ii) ** If Parent or the Securityholders' Representative elects, by
written notice to the other party, not to control the defense of a Tax Contest
that it has authority to control, the other party may assume control of the
defense of such Tax Contest. In such event, the party electing not to control
the defense of such Tax Contest (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") will be
given the opportunity to participate in, but not direct or conduct, any
defense of such Tax Contest, unless such participation would affect any
privilege of the party controlling the defense of such Tax Contest (the "
_Controlling Party_ "). The Non-Controlling Party's participation under such
circumstances will be subject to the Controlling Party's right to control such
defense. The Controlling Party will not settle any such Tax Contest without
the consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Controlling Party will (i)
keep the Non-Controlling Party advised of the status of such claim and the
defense thereof (including all material developments and events relating
thereto) and will consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-
Controlling Party with respect thereto and (ii) make available to the Non-
Controlling Party any documents or materials in its possession or control that
may be necessary to understand the defense of such claim (subject to
protection of the attorney-client privilege). The Non-Controlling Party will
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with
respect to such Tax Contest (including copies of any summons, complaints or
other pleadings that may have been served on such party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
and will otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party
in the defense of such Tax Contest.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(d) Post-** **Closing** **Actions**. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Legal Requirements or with prior written consent of the
Securityholders' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, Parent, the Company and its Affiliates shall
not, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) make (or cause
to be made) any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) amend (or
cause to be amended) any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date and (iii) initiate or file any voluntary disclosure or similar
agreements with any Tax authority relating to any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent, the Company and its Affiliates shall not, with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries make an election under Sections 336 or 338(g) of
the Code with respect to the transactions pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

 **(e) Straddle Periods**. For purposes of this Agreement, the
determination of the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be: (i)
in the case of Taxes that are either: (A) based upon or related to income or
receipts; (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), or (C)
withholding Taxes, deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
taxable period ended with (and included) the Closing Date; and (ii) in the
case of any other Taxes, such as ad valorem taxes, deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period. For purposes of this Agreement, the
taxable year of a Company Subsidiary that is a "controlled foreign
corporation" or a "specified foreign corporation" for U.S. federal income tax
purposes shall be treated as ending on the Closing Date. With respect to a Tax
Return for a Straddle Period required to be filed after the Closing Date by
Parent pursuant to _Section_ _5.4(b)(ii)_ , Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
pay on or before five days from the due date of such Tax Return all amounts
that are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period determined in accordance
with this section (except to the extent (on a dollar for dollar basis) such
amounts were taken into account in calculating Closing Date Net Working
Capital).

  



  

 **5.5. Indemnification of Directors and Officers of ****Company**.

  



  

 **(a)** Prior to or as of the Closing, the Company will cause coverage
to be extended under the director and officer insurance policy (or policies)
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any
actions or omissions by any current or former officers or directors of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_")
occurring at or prior to the Closing, by obtaining a related "tail" policy
that has an effective term of six years from the Closing Date, with coverage
in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing coverage.
The cost of such tail policy will be treated as a Specified Transaction
Expense of the Company. Parent will not, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b)** In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to indemnify and hold
harmless, reimburse, exculpate from liability, and advance expenses to all DandO
Indemnified Parties to the same extent and on the same terms as such persons
are entitled to indemnification, reimbursement, exculpation or expense
advancement by Company or any such Company Subsidiary as of the Agreement
Date, whether pursuant to applicable documents (including the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing documents) of any
Subsidiary), individual indemnification agreements, by Legal Requirement or
otherwise, for acts or omissions or matters which occurred or arose at or
prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether any proceeding relating to
any DandO Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification, exculpation, or expense
advancement with respect to any such matters, acts, or omissions is commenced
before or after the Closing); provided that no DandO Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification, reimbursement, exculpation, or advancement of expenses from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for amounts such DandO Indemnified Party
owes or may owe to any Parent or the Surviving Corporation in such DandO
Indemnified Party's capacity as Company Securityholder under the provisions
set forth in _Section_ _8_. Any claims for indemnification made under this
_Section_ _5.5_ on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
shall survive until the final resolution thereof.

  



  

 **(c)** The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its successors to, pay all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party
(or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns) in any
legal action brought by such person that is successful to enforce the
obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or its successors under this
_Section_ _5.5_. The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and its
successors under this _Section_ _5.5_ shall not be terminated, amended, or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified
Party (or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns)
without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified Party (or his or her
heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns, as applicable).

  



  

 **5.6. Parachute Payments**. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will solicit Company Stockholder
approval (in compliance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) of the right of any individual who is or would
reasonably be expected to be, as of the Closing Date, a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and who has executed a
waiver as described in the following sentence to receive payments and benefits
that could be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2)
of the Code). In addition, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
(a) ensure that the payments and benefits that would otherwise constitute a
"parachute payment" be exempt from the definition of "parachute payment" by
reason of the exemption provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
(b) take all actions necessary to so exempt any such payments and benefits
(including to obtain any necessary consents from such disqualified individuals
to waive such "parachute payments" to the extent such Company Stockholder
approval is not obtained).

  



  

   

  



  

 **5.7. Stockholder Action**.

  



  

 **(a) ** The Company's board of directors has declared this Agreement,
the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, advisable and approved a
resolution recommending approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions by the Company Stockholders (the " _Board
Recommendation_ ").

  



  

 **(b) ** Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Company will, in accordance with and pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL,
take all action necessary to seek and obtain, as soon as practicable, written
consents from all Company Stockholders, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit F_ (the " _Stockholder Written Consents_ "). No amendment or
supplement (including any incorporated by reference) to the Stockholder
Written Consents or any of such related information will be made without the
approval of Parent. As soon as practicable following the Company's receipt of
Stockholder Written Consents, the Company will deliver to Parent copies of
such Stockholder Written Consents, certified as true and complete by the
secretary of the Company.

  



  

 **(c) ** Within one Business Day after the date hereof, the Company will
deliver to Parent Stockholder Written Consents, duly executed by Company
Stockholders holding sufficient Company Shares to provide the Required
Stockholder Approval.

  



  

 **(d)** Following receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval, the
Company will promptly deliver to each holder of Company Shares a notice of the
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by written consent of the holders of
Company Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, which notice
must include the required notice to holders of Company Shares required by
applicable Legal Requirements that appraisal rights may be available to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with the DGCL. Prior to the delivery
of such notice to the Company Stockholders, the Company must have given Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity (but in no event fewer than five
Business Days prior to delivery to the Company Stockholders) to review and
comment on the proposed notice and all related information proposed to be
provided in connection therewith. If the Company determines it is commercially
reasonable to exercise its rights under Section 3.2 of the Voting Agreement,
the Company shall use its best efforts to enforce the requirements of Section
3.2 of the Voting Agreement and require the Company Stockholders subject
thereto to deliver all required consents and documentation thereunder and to
take (or refrain from taking) such actions specified therein.

  



  

 **5.8. Notification of Certain Matters**.

  



  

 **(a)** During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, upon becoming
aware of any of the following, promptly notify Parent (i) if any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement was, when
made, or at any time thereafter became (or would have become, but for any
limitation set forth in such representation or warranty as to the date on
which such representation or warranty is, was, or will be made), untrue or
inaccurate in any respect that would reasonably be expected to result in the
condition set forth in _Section_ _6.2(a)_ to not be satisfied; (ii) if the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, fact, change, condition or
circumstance has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause any condition
to the obligations of Parent to effect the Contemplated Transactions not to be
satisfied; (iii) of the failure of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to result in the condition set forth in _Section_
_6.2(b)_ to not be satisfied; or (iv) of the institution or written threat of
any legal proceeding against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
related to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions (the events, facts
and circumstances and failures described in clauses (i) - (iv), individually
and collectively, the " _Post-Signing Events_ ").

  



  

   

  



  

 **(b)** The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ _5.8_ will
not be deemed to modify the representations and warranties in _Section_ _2_
for purposes of _Section_ _6.2_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Post-
Signing Event is disclosed to Parent in writing in accordance with this
_Section_ _5.8_ , such Post-Signing Event constitutes or would constitute a
failure of a condition contained in _Section_ _6.2(a)_ or _6.2(b)_ to be met,
and Company notifies Parent in writing that, as a result of such Post-Signing
Event, there is a failure of a condition contained in _Section _ _6.2(a)_ or
_6.2(b)_ , Parent will have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section _ _7.1(d)_ after complying with the procedures therein.

  



  

 **(c)** For clarity, unintentional failure to give notice under
_Section_ _5.8(a)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this
_Section_ _5.8_ and shall constitute only a breach of the underlying
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition, as the case may
be. For clarity, any breach or violation of the notification required under
the parenthetical clause in _Section_ _5.8(a)_ _(i)_ will not result in any
monetary or other liability of the Company or Company Securityholders.

  



  

 **5.9. Termination of Company Options**. During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company will take all actions necessary and sufficient in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, and, as applicable, the Company
Equity Incentive Plan and each Company Option (in each case, including
obtaining all of the Option Termination Agreements with respect to outstanding
Company Options and other necessary consents, and obtaining approval of its
board of directors) (a) to give effect to the actions contemplated by
_Section_ _1.13_ , including taking such action, if any, as is required to
cause all outstanding Company Options to the extent then unvested, to become
fully vested and exercisable, and to cancel all outstanding Company Options
upon payment as contemplated by _Section_ _1.13_ , effective immediately
following the Effective Time; and (b) to automatically terminate, as of the
Effective Time, the Company Equity Incentive Plan and all Company Options
(including any underlying agreements relating to the Company Options), such
that at the Effective Time and upon the payments contemplated by _Section_
_1.13_ , no Person will have any right to purchase or receive any equity or
payment interest, or right convertible into or exercisable for any equity or
payment interest, of the Company.

  



  

 **5.10. Letters of Transmittal and Other Agreements**. During the Pre-
Closing Period, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
and deliver to Parent (a) Letters of Transmittal from each of the Company
Stockholders; (b) Option Termination Agreements from each of the Company
Optionholders; and (c) Warrant Termination Agreements from each holder of a
Company Warrant, and the Company and Parent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to the other party such other agreements and
instruments necessary to satisfy the conditions to Closing hereunder.

  



  

   

  



  

 **5.11. No Solicitation or Negotiation**.

  



  

 **(a)** The Company acknowledges that neither it, nor its

under this Agreement (and with respect to a particular Company Securityholder,
under any Letter of Transmittal, any Warrant Termination Agreement and/or any
Option Termination Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a party).
For clarity, this means (a) that the survival periods and liability limits set

statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims shall
be shortened or lengthened to the applicable claims periods and survival

Letter of Transmittal, any Warrant Termination Agreement and/or any Option
Termination Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a party) whether
or not in excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to
this _Section_ _8_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_
_8_ will limit any party's or indemnified party's right to seek and obtain
specific performance or injunctive relief to which any party may be entitled
or to seek any remedy on account of any party's fraud or criminal actions (for
clarity, the dollar liability limit of any Company Securityholder with respect

Deductible will not apply to any Excluded Matters.

  



  

 **(iii) Mini-Basket**. Subject to _Sections_ _8.1(e)(vi)_ and without
limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of the Company Securityholders provided for in

rights under this Agreement for any single claim (or series of related claims
or claims arising from similar facts and circumstances), unless and until the
Damages from such single claim (or series of related claims or claims arising
from similar facts and circumstances) against which such Indemnified Persons
would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under _Section_ _8.1(b)_ _(i)_
and _Section_ _8.1(c)_ exceeds $25,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ "), after which
the Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification for all of their
Damages with respect to such claim (or series of related claims or claims

_however_ , that the Mini-Basket will not apply to any Excluded Matters.

  



  

 **(iv) Cap**. Subject to _Sections_ _8.1(e)(vi)_ and without limiting
the effect of any other limitation contained in this Agreement, the Company
Securityholders' indemnity obligations under _Section_ _8.1(b)_ _(i)_ and
_Section_ _8.1(c)_ will be limited, in the aggregate, to $25,000,000 (the "
_Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap will not apply to any Excluded
Matters. Subject to _Sections_ _8.1(e)(vi)_ and without limiting the effect of
any other limitation contained in this Agreement, each Company
Securityholder's indemnity obligations with respect to the Excluded Matters
(other than under _Section_ _8.1(e)(vi)_ ) will be limited, in the aggregate,
to the amount of the Aggregate Merger Consideration actually received by such
Company Securityholder (inclusive of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, WC Escrow
Amount, and Securityholders' Representative Amount attributable to such
Company Securityholder) (the " _Upper Cap_ ").

  



  

   

  



  

 **(v) Materiality**. For purposes of determining the failure of any
representations or warranties to be true and correct and calculating Damages
hereunder, any reference to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect in
the representations and warranties will be disregarded.

  



  

 **(vi) Fraud ****and Criminal Actions**. Nothing in this Agreement will
limit any remedy any party hereto or any Company Securityholder with respect
to fraud or intentional material criminal actions personally committed by such
Person, and only in the case of fraud or intentional material criminal actions
will a Company Securityholder be liable for more than his, her or its Upper
Cap.

  



  

 **(vii) Applicability of Limitations**. The right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement will not be affected by any
investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired, capable of
being acquired, or that is alleged the other party should have known, at any
time, whether before or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement (except as provided for in _Section_ _3.7_ ). The waiver
of any condition based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty,
or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements,
will not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

  



  

 **(viii) Calculation of ****Damages**. Any claim for Damages will be
calculated: (i) as to actual losses and out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Parent or any other Indemnified Person, without regard to
reductions or diminutions in value, lost opportunities or other speculative
damages; (ii) without regard to any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental,
or consequential damages unless (x) any such punitive, exemplary, special,
incidental, or consequential damages are actually awarded to a third party by
a Governmental Authority or (y) in the case of special or consequential
damages only, any such special or consequential damages are reasonably
foreseeable under an objective standard; and (iii) such that costs and
expenses (including those incurred in investigating, defending or resolving
any applicable third-party claim) shall constitute Damages if and solely to
the extent that such underlying claim is indemnifiable hereunder (without
taking into account such costs and expenses when determining whether such
underlying claim is indemnifiable hereunder).

  



  

 **(ix) Primacy of ****Indemnity Escrow Account** **;** **General
Unresolved Claims**. Amounts of Damages owed by a Company Securityholder to an
Indemnified Person under _Section_ _8_ , other than _Section_ _8.1(c)_ , that
have been resolved in favor of an Indemnified Person shall be recovered,
first, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and, only after the Indemnity Escrow
Fund has been exhausted in full, then pursuant to _Section_ _1.6(d)_ and then,
only if _Section_ _1.6(d)_ is no longer applicable, directly from the Company
Securityholders. At least two Business Days prior to the Preliminary Escrow
Release Date, Parent shall provide the Securityholders' Representative with
its good faith summary of all General Unresolved Claims as of such date, and
only such amounts as Parent and the Securityholders' Representative agree in
good faith are reasonably necessary to satisfy such General Unresolved Claims
shall be retained in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Following the Preliminary
Escrow Release Date, if a General Unresolved Claim that was made prior to the
Preliminary Escrow Release Date is finally resolved, then Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall within five Business Days after the
final resolution of such General Unresolved Claim (or all General Unresolved
Claims) instruct the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
the appropriate amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent and
the Surviving Corporation for further distribution to the Company
Securityholders.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(x) Other Limitations**. Any claim for indemnification under
_Section_ _8_ other than _Section_ _8.1(c)_ , and any offer to compromise or
settle such claim, must be made on a pro rata basis to each Company
Securityholder (based on his, her or its respective Pro Rata Portion). ****

  



  

 **(xi) Tax ****Matters**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Company Securityholders shall not have any liability or
indemnification obligation for any Taxes of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) resulting from any election made under Section 336 or 338 of the Code with
respect to the Merger, (ii) that are not Pre-Closing Taxes, (iii) resulting
from any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries out of the
ordinary course of business on the Closing Date or after the Closing, or (iv)
based on the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates to utilize any net operating loss, net capital loss, Tax basis,
investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or other
credit or Tax attribute that could be carried forward or back to reduce Taxes
(including deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) in any
Tax period or portion thereof (including any Straddle Period).

  



  

 **(xii) No Liability for Others**. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, in no event will any Company Securityholder be liable for
any other Company Securityholder's breach of such other Company
Securityholder's representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements
contained in any Letter of Transmittal, any Warrant Termination Agreement
and/or Option Termination Agreement, or other ancillary agreement hereto to
which such other Company Securityholder is a party.

  



  

 **(xiii) Pre-Closing Period**. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
a matter arises between the date hereof and the Closing Date (other than as a
result of fraud by the Company under this Agreement) and thereby results in a
failure of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in the certificate described in _Section _ _6.2(c)_ , such
failure shall not be deemed to be fraud with respect to such representation or
warranty (for example, because the Company may not legally effectively update
the Company Disclosure Schedule), unless and to the extent actions of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries relating to any such matter would
otherwise constitute fraud.

  



  

 **(xiv) Rescission**. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein shall give rise to any right on the part of an Indemnified Person after
the consummation of the Merger to rescind this Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(f) Control ****of Defense; Conditions**. Except as otherwise
provided in _Section_ _5.4(c)_ , which will apply to all Tax Contests, in the
event that Parent or another Indemnified Person becomes aware of a third party
claim (any such claim, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that Parent believes may
result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ _8_ by or on
behalf of an Indemnified Person, Parent will promptly notify the
Securityholders' Representative of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no delay in providing such notice prior to the applicable
Representation Termination Date will affect an Indemnified Person's rights
hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Company
Securityholders are materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice must contain a
reasonably detailed description of the basis of the claim and the nature and
amount, if then reasonably ascertainable, of such Damages that may be
indemnifiable. The obligations of the Company Securityholders under this
_Section_ _8_ with respect to Damages arising from any Third Party Claim will
be governed by the following additional terms and conditions:

  



  

 **(i) ** The Securityholders' Representative, at its option and at the
expense of the Company Securityholders, will be entitled to assume control of
the defense of any Third Party Claim at any time within 30 days of receiving
written notice of the Third Party Claim from Parent and may appoint as lead
counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the Securityholders'
Representative and reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_ that the
Securityholders' Representative will not be entitled to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim without Parent's express written consent in
the event (A) the named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Company Securityholders and the
Indemnified Person and, in the opinion of counsel to the Securityholders'
Representative and the Indemnified Person, there is an actual conflict of
interest between the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnified
Person, (B) the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim seeks material non-monetary
relief (in which case, the portion of the Third Party Claim unrelated to
monetary relief may be controlled by Parent), (C) the Indemnified Person
determines in good faith that an adverse determination of such claim could be
materially detrimental to Indemnified Person's business, (D) the indemnifying
party has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim,
or (E) the claim relates to or arises in connection with any potential
criminal liability or regulatory violation of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Company (in which case, the portion of the Third Party
Claim unrelated to monetary relief may be controlled by Parent) (each, an "
_Assumable Claim_ "). In the event that the Securityholders' Representative
assumes control of the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Securityholders'
Representative will keep Parent informed of all material events and
developments, including promptly providing copies of any correspondence and
court filings, with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

 **(ii)** Notwithstanding _Section_ _8.1(f)(i)_ above, the Indemnified
Person will be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , that such
employment will be at the Indemnified Person's own expense unless the
indemnifying party is otherwise liable for such amounts as Damages hereunder.
The Indemnified Person will have the right, by notice to the Securityholders'
Representative, to assume the defense of an Assumable Claim and the reasonable
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Person's counsel incurred in connection
with such Assumable Claim will be included in Damages if it is ultimately
determined pursuant to the procedures hereunder that the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ _8_ with respect to
such Assumable Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if it is ultimately
determined by agreement of the Securityholders' Representative and the
Indemnified Person or by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to
such Assumable Claim, such fees and expenses will not be Damages.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(iii)** In connection with a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
claiming indemnification shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying
party and make available to the indemnifying party all pertinent information
under its control (provided that all Confidential Information shall be subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent will, and will cause employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate fully with the
Securityholders' Representative in connection with any matter for which
Company Securityholders are the indemnifying party. Such cooperation may
include, without limitation, (a) assisting in the collection and preparation
of discovery materials, (b) meeting with (and making employees available to
meet with) the Securityholders' Representative and/or its counsel to prepare
for and/or appear as witnesses at depositions, court proceedings and/or trial
and (c) providing to the Securityholders' Representative and/or its counsel
all information under the control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is deemed necessary by the Securityholders' Representative and/or its
counsel for the defense or prosecution of such matter (subject to the
attorney-client privilege). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, in no event will the Indemnified Person be required to waive any
attorney-client privilege in connection with such cooperation. All costs
incurred by the Indemnified Person and reasonable fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Person's counsel incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection
with the cooperation required under this _Section_ _8.1(f)(iii)_ will be
included in Damages in the event that it is ultimately determined pursuant to
the procedures hereunder that the Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ _8_ with respect to such Third
Party Claim _provided_ , _however_ , that if it is ultimately determined by
agreement of the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnified Person or
by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not
entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to the Third Party Claim,
such costs, fees and expenses will not be Damages.

  



  

 **(iv)** Neither the Securityholders' Representative nor the Indemnified
Person may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (it being understood and agreed that it shall be
reasonable for the Securityholders' Representative to withhold such consent if
the Securityholders' Representative believes in good faith that there is not
any underlying basis for indemnification with respect to such settlement or
compromise).

  



  

 **(g) Insurance, Third Party Indemnities, and ****Tax** **Benefits**.
The amount of any Damages payable under this _Section_ _8_ will be net of
amounts actually received by the Indemnified Person under its applicable
insurance policies issued by insurance companies or amounts recovered from
third parties under indemnification rights (other than the indemnities
contemplated by this _Section_ _8_ ) with respect to such Damages (determined
after giving effect to any deductible associated therewith, any increase in
premiums (including retropremium obligations) resulting therefrom). If an
Indemnified Person receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies
issued by insurance companies or indemnification proceeds subsequent to its
receipt of an indemnification payment by the indemnifying parties, then such
Indemnified Person will, without duplication, promptly reimburse the
indemnifying parties (net of costs and expenses of such recovery and resulting
premium increases) for any payment made by such indemnifying parties up to the
amount received by the Indemnified Person; _provided_ , that the aggregate
amount of reimbursement payments to the indemnifying parties in respect of any
such Damages will not in any event exceed the aggregate indemnification
payment received by the Indemnified Person from the indemnifying parties with
respect to such Damages. The Indemnified Persons shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek, when applicable, recovery under director and
officer tail insurance policy purchased pursuant to _Section_ _5.5(a)_
covering any Damage against such insurers. Nothing in this _Section_ _8.1(g)_
will be construed to require any Person to obtain or maintain any insurance
coverage (provided that Parent will not cancel any prepaid insurance coverage
obtained by the Company prior to the Closing or exclude the Company from any
group or umbrella insurance policies of Parent that cover subsidiaries of
Parent similarly situated to the Company). In calculating amounts payable to
the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Section 8_ , the amount of any
Damages shall be computed net of any Loss Tax Benefit. For purposes hereof, "
_Loss Tax Benefit_ " means the net Tax savings, refunds or benefits realized
in the year of the Loss or the following taxable year by the Indemnified
Persons or their Affiliates actually received on a last deduction basis that
is attributable to any deduction, loss, credit, refund, or other reduction in
Tax resulting from or arising out of such Damages.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(h) No Duplication of Recovery**. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any Damages
resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Company under this Agreement is taken into account as a
current liability, reserved or accrued, or otherwise accounted for, in
determining Closing Date Net Working Capital, or on the Company Balance Sheet,
or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, (A) no Indemnified Person may recover such Damages through a
claim pursuant to _Section_ _8_ or otherwise and (B) such Damages will not be
included in the determination of whether all Damages, in the aggregate, exceed
the Deductible or the Cap and (ii) no Indemnified Person may recover
duplicative Damages in respect of a single set of facts or circumstances under
more than one representation or warranty in this Agreement, any Letter of
Transmittal, any Warrant Termination Agreement and/or Option Termination
Agreement regardless of whether such facts or circumstances would give rise to
a breach of more than one representation or warranty in this Agreement, any
Letter of Transmittal, any Warrant Termination Agreement and/or any Option
Termination Agreement.

  



  

 **8.2. Exercise of Remedies by ****Indemnified Persons** **other
than** **Parent**. No Indemnified Person (other than Parent) will be permitted
to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent consents to the assertion of such indemnification
claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

  



  

 **8.3. Savings Clause**. The parties intend that the provisions of
this _Section 8_ substantially comply with the requirements set forth in
Section 3.3 of the Voting Agreement. If the Company exercises the rights under
Section 3.2 of the Voting Agreement, in the event that any provision of this
_Section 8_ , or the application thereof, does not, or is declared by a court
of competent jurisdiction to not, substantially comply with the requirements
set forth in Section 3.3 of the Voting Agreement, then all other terms of this
_Section 8_ will nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and such term
automatically will be amended so that it complies with the requirements set
forth in Section 3.3 of the Voting Agreement, but in a manner as close to the
parties' original intent as is permissible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties agree that for purposes of compliance with Section 3.3 of the Voting
Agreement, any Earn-Out Payment that is earned pursuant to _Section 1.6_
hereof shall be deemed to be an "escrow" (as that term is used in Section 3.3
of the Voting Agreement) to give effect to the provisions set forth in
_Section_ _1.6(d)_.

  



  

   

  



  

 **8.4. Treatment of Indemnification Payments**. The parties agree that
any amount paid to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ _8_ will
be treated as a reduction in the consideration payable hereunder for Tax
purposes.

  



  

 **9. General Provisions**.

); and (c) may not be assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or by Company or
the Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand (by operation of law or

collaterally assign their rights under this Agreement to their lenders or the
lenders of any of their Affiliates. This Agreement will be binding upon, and
will inure to the benefit of, each party and its successors and permitted
assigns.

  



  

   

  



  

 **9.4. Severability**. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof becomes, or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement, and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, will not be impaired or otherwise affected and will
continue in full force and effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

  



  

 **9.5. Expenses**. Other than as set forth in this Agreement, the

 **9.6. Specific Performance**. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any provision of this Agreement was
not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto will be entitled
(in addition to any other remedies available to them (as limited by the terms
in _Section_ _8_ following the Closing)) to the remedies of specific
performance (which will include the right to obtain an order compelling a
party's counterparty hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and injunctive relief (without bond or other security being
required and without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages)
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

 **9.7. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution**.

  



  

 **(a)** This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising out
of or related to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
the relationship of the parties, and/or the interpretation and enforcement of
the rights and duties of the parties, whether arising in contract, tort,
equity or otherwise, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware (including in respect of the statute of
limitations or other limitations period applicable to any such claim,
controversy or dispute; _provided_ , that the parties agree that Section
8106(c) of Title 10 of the Delaware Code shall not apply to any matter
governed by the statute of limitations under Delaware law), without regard to
any applicable principles of conflicts of law that might require the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

  



  

 **(b) ** Any judicial proceeding brought with respect to this Agreement
must be brought in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction
located in the State of Delaware, and, by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each party (i) accepts and consents to, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of such courts and any related appellate
court, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in
connection with this Agreement, and (ii) irrevocably waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have as to the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in such a court or that such court is an inconvenient
forum.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(c)** Service of process, summons, notice or other document by mail to
such party's address set forth herein will be effective service of process for
any suit, action or other proceeding relating to this Agreement or the

after giving effect to the Closing), each Company Securityholder and the
Securityholders' Representative irrevocably and unconditionally waives the
right to trial by jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

 **9.8. Rules of Construction**.

  



  

 **(a)** The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  



  

 **(b)** For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires:
the singular number includes the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
includes the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender includes the
masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender includes the masculine and

limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation," (ii) the words "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and "hereto" will
be deemed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any specific
section of this Agreement, and (iii) all references to "$" mean United States
dollars.

  



  

 **(d)** Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of
this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement.

  



  

 **(e)** The words "will" and "shall" when used in this Agreement will be

capital letters have the meanings ascribed to them herein and all terms
defined in this Agreement will have such defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein.

  



  

 **9.9. Time is of the Essence**. Time is of the essence of this
Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

 **9.10. Amendment; Waiver**. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by Parent, the Company and the
Securityholders' Representative. Any waiver of any of the terms or conditions
of this Agreement must be in writing and must be duly executed by or on behalf
of the party to be charged with such waiver. Except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, the failure of a party to exercise any of its rights hereunder
or to insist upon strict adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one
occasion will not be construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right
thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement at a later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of
any other term of condition hereof (whether or not similar).

  



  

 **9.11. Headings**. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only, will not be deemed to be a
part of this Agreement and will not be referred to in connection with the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

 **9.12. Conflicts and Privilege**. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that the Company Securityholders have retained Goodwin Procter
LLP ("Goodwin") to act as their counsel in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Securityholders' Representative and the Company Securityholders,
on the other hand, Goodwin may represent the Securityholders' Representative
and/or the Company Securityholders in such dispute even though the interests
of the Securityholders' Representative and/or the Company Securityholders may
be directly adverse to Parent and its Affiliates, and even though Goodwin may
have represented the Company or a Company Subsidiary in a matter substantially
related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that, as
to all communications among Goodwin, the Company, the Securityholders'
Representative and/or any Company Securityholder that relate in any way to the
Contemplated Transactions or a similar transaction prior to the Closing (the "
_Privileged Information_ "), the attorney-client privilege and the expectation
of client confidence belongs to the Securityholders' Representative and the
Company Securityholders and may be controlled by the Securityholders'
Representative and the Company Securityholders and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Affiliates. Prior to the Closing, the Company may delete all Privileged
Information from the Company's and/or Company Subsidiary's systems, books, and
records; _provided_ , that if the Company fails to so delete any Privileged
Information, (i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective
Subsidiaries acknowledge that such failure shall not waive such privilege of
the Securityholders' Representative and/or Company Securityholders, (ii)
Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholders' Representative of the
existence of such Privileged Information, (iii) Parent shall provide a copy of
any such Privileged Information to the Securityholders' Representative, and
(iv) Parent shall delete such Privileged Information from its and its
Affiliates' systems, books and records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Securityholders'
Representative or a Company Securityholder, on the other hand, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, and their Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or its Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Securityholders' Representative.

$58,000,000, and equal to or less than $62,000,000, then such portion of the
Shahky Earn-out Payment will be equal to the _sum_ of (A) $5,800,000 _plus_
(B) the _product_ of ( _x_ ) (1) the 2022 Shahky Associated EBITA _less_ (2)
$58,000,000, _times_ ( _y_ ) 2.25;

  



  

 **(iii)** If the 2022 Shahky Associated EBITA is greater than
$62,000,000, and equal to or less than $66,000,000, then such portion of the
Shahky Earn-out Payment will be equal to the _sum_ of (A) $14,800,000 _plus_
(B) the _product_ of ( _x_ ) (1) the 2022 Shahky Associated EBITA _less_ (2)
$62,000,000, _times_ ( _y_ ) 2.80; or

EBITA _less_ (2) $66,000,000, _times_ ( _y_ ) 4.75.

  



  

 **(c) ** _2022 Non-Shahky EBITA_. If Non-Shahky EBITA for the Second
Measurement Period (the " _2022 Non-Shahky EBITA_ "), equals or exceeds
$190,000,000 (the " _2022 Non-Shahky EBITA Milestone_ "), Parent will pay the
Company Securityholders $30,000,000 of the Earn-out Amount (the " _Non-Shahky
Earn-out Payment_ " and together with the Shahky Earn-out Payment, the "
_Second Earn-out Payment_ "). If the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA is equal to or
greater than $150,000,000, but less than the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA Milestone,
Parent will pay the Company Securityholders a portion of the Non-Shahky Earn-
out Payment determined as follows:

  



  

 **(i) ** If the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA is equal to or greater than
$150,000,000, and equal to or less than $160,000,000, then such portion of the
Non-Shahky Earn-out Payment will be equal to the _product_ of (A) ( _x_ ) the
2022 Non-Shahky EBITA _less_ ( _y_ ) $150,000,000, _times_ (B) 0.40;

  



  

 **(ii)** If the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA is greater than $160,000,000, and

out Payment will be equal to the _sum_ of (A) $4,000,000 _plus_ (B) the
_product_ of ( _x_ ) (1) the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA _less_ (2) $160,000,000,
_times_ ( _y_ ) 0.55;

  



  

 **(iii)** If the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA is greater than $170,000,000, and
equal to or less than $180,000,000, then such portion of the Non-Shahky Earn-
out Payment will be equal to the _sum_ of (A) $9,500,000 _plus_ (B) the
_product_ of ( _x_ ) (1) the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA _less_ (2) $170,000,000,
_times_ ( _y_ ) 0.75; or

  



  

 **(iv) ** If the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA is greater than $180,000,000, and

(B) the _product_ of ( _x_ ) (1) the 2022 Non-Shahky EBITA _less_ (2)
$180,000,000, _times_ ( _y_ ) 1.30.

  



  

 **(d) ** _First Earn-out Payment Rollover_. If the 2020 EBITA Milestone
is not met, then one-half of the unearned portion of the First Earn-out
Payment ( _i.e._ , $250,000,000 _less_ the amount determined under _Section
1.1(a)(i)_ , _Section 1.1(a)(ii)_ , or _Section 1.1(a)(iii)_ of this _Schedule
1.6_ , _Part A_ , as applicable) (such amount, the " _Rollover Amount_ ") will
roll over and potentially qualify for payment if any portion of the Non-Shahky
Earn-out Payment is earned. If there is a Rollover Amount and any portion of
the Non-Shahky Earn-out Payment is earned, Parent will pay the Company
Securityholders a portion of the Rollover Amount (which will be reflected as
part of, and an increase to, the Non-Shahky Earn-out Payment calculated in
_Section 1.1(c)_ of this _Schedule 1.6_ , _Part A_ ) equal to the _product_ of
(1) the Rollover Amount _times_ (2) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is
equal to the amount of the Non-Shahky Earn-out Payment earned under _Section
1.1(c)_ of this _Schedule 1.6_ , _Part A_ , and (B) the denominator of which
is equal to $30,000,000.

business of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. The CEO and
relevant Senior Managers shall participate in the Parent's periodic management
and review processes, including regular reviews of financial performance and
operations, in the same manner and frequency as other divisions and business
units of Parent. The CEO, in consultation with the other Senior Managers and
the management of Parent, will be responsible for the operations of and have
the right to make and implement all decisions for the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, provided that such decisions are Commercially

the Earn-out Plan and the conduct of the business of the Surviving Corporation

out Plan.

  



  

 **(b)** The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not be
required to engage in discounting, promotional, or refund practices that are
materially inconsistent with those of the Company pre-Closing unless required
by law, regulations, or Accounting Principles.

quarter beginning with the second complete calendar quarter during the
Measurement Period, during ordinary business hours and at times that do not
disrupt their ordinary business activities, to answer questions of the
Securityholders' Representative concerning the quarterly EBITA reports and the
status of the Earn-out Plan; _provided_ that (i) the Securityholders'
Representative maintains the confidentiality of such information in accordance
with _Section 6.1(b)_ of this _Schedule 1.6_ , _Part A_ , and (y) such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

 **3.2 EBITA Statements.**

  



  

No later than ninety (90) days after the end of each of the First Measurement
Period and the Second Measurement Period, Parent shall prepare and deliver to
the Securityholders' Representative (i) an unaudited statement of income of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for such Measurement Period,

 **3.3 EBITA Audit Rights.**

  



  

From and after delivery of the Earn-out Statement delivered in respect of an
applicable Measurement Period, upon reasonable advance written notice from the
Securityholders' Representative, Parent shall permit the Independent
Accounting Firm to have access at reasonable times during normal business
hours to the books and records of Parent and its Affiliates as may be
reasonably necessary to evaluate and verify the accuracy of the Milestone
calculations set forth in the Earn-out Statement and the figures underlying
such calculations; provided that (i) the Securityholders' Representative (and
the Independent Accounting Firm) enter into customary confidentiality
agreements reasonably satisfactory to Parent with respect to the confidential
information of Parent or its Affiliates to be furnished pursuant to this
Section, and (ii) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation). The Independent Accounting Firm shall provide Parent with a copy
of all disclosures made to the Securityholders' Representative. The fees and
charges of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the

 **4.1 Resulting from an EBITA Audit.**

  



  

If, in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ _3.3_ of this
_Schedule 1.6_ , _Part A_ , the Independent Accounting Firm concludes that the
Earn-out Payment should have been paid but was not paid when due, in whole or
part (other than a shortfall equal to or less than $100,000), within sixty
(60) days after the date the Independent Accounting Firm delivers to Parent
the Independent Accounting Firm's written report (a " _Shortfall Report_ "),
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Paying Agent for payment to the Company
Securityholders cash in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the
applicable short fall in the Earn-out Payment, plus interest on such sum at
the "prime rate" as published in the Wall Street Journal from time to time,
from when the Earn-out Payment should have been paid (if Parent had given
notice of achievement of the Earn-out Payment pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement), as applicable, to the date of actual payment. The decision of such
Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on Parent
and the Company Securityholders, shall be nonappealable and shall not be
subject to further review, absent manifest error.

  



  

 **4.2 Modifications Relating to Parent.**

  



  

In the event that any Acquisition Proposal involving Parent (substituting
references to "Parent" for references to "the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries" and references to "50.1%" for references to "15%" in the
definition thereof) occurs during any Measurement Period, Parent shall cause
Parent's successor entity or surviving entity to assume the obligations of
Parent (and, if Parent survives such transaction, Parent shall remain
responsible for such entity's performance) under Section 1.6 of the Agreement
and this _Schedule 1.6_. The Securityholders' Representative, on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation Securityholders, shall be a third-party beneficiary of
such assumption.

  



  

   

  



  

 **4.3 Dispute Resolution.**

  



  

 **(a)** In the event of an Earn-Out Default, the Securityholders'
Representative may notify Parent in writing (the " _Dispute Resolution_
_Notice_ ") specifying in reasonable detail the basis of the Earn-Out Default
and the amount, nature and basis of any Damages resulting from such Earn-Out
Default, which Damages, solely for purposes of this _Schedule 1.6_ may include
any special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from such Earn-Out
Default, provided that any such special, incidental or consequential damages
shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount of all Earn-Out Payments payable
under this _Schedule 1.6_.

  



  

 **(b)** Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such differences regarding the
Earn-Out Default and the determination of any Damages resulting therefrom for
a period of thirty (30) calendar days after Parent's receipt of the Dispute
Resolution Notice. If Parent and the Securityholders' Representative are
unable to resolve such dispute with such thirty (30) calendar day period, then
either party may, by written notice, invoke an arbitration process which will
be conducted as follows:

  



  

 **(i) ** Parent and the Securityholders' Representative will select and
agree upon a mutually acceptable independent third party who is neutral,
disinterested and impartial for the applicable dispute (the " _Mediator_ ").
If Parent and the Securityholders' Representative are unable to mutually agree
upon a Mediator within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the request
for arbitration, then upon request by either Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative, the Mediator will be an arbitrator appointed by Judicial and
Mediation Services (" _JAMS_ "). Once the Mediator has been selected, each of
Parent and the Securityholders' Representative will within ten (10) days
following selection of the Mediator provide the Mediator and the other party
with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance
of the dispute (including the basis of the Earn-Out Default and the
calculation of Damages) and may submit a revised or updated report and
position to the Mediator within ten (10) days of receiving the other party's
report. If so requested by the Mediator, each party will make oral submissions
to the Mediator based on such party's written report, and each party will have
the right to be present during any such oral submissions.

  



  

 **(ii) ** In the event the Mediator is a JAMS arbitrator selected by
JAMS as provided in this _Schedule 1.6_ , the matter will be conducted as a
binding arbitration in accordance with JAMS procedures, as modified by this
_Schedule 1.6_ (including that the arbitrator will adopt as his or her
decision the position of one party or the other, as described below). In such
event, the arbitrator may retain a third party expert with relevant
diagnostics industry experience for the Mediator to assist in rendering such
decision, and the expenses of any such expert will be shared by the parties as
costs of the arbitration as provided in this _Schedule 1.6_.

  



  

 **(iii)** The Mediator will, no later than fifteen (15) days after the
last submission of the written reports and, if any, oral submissions, select
either Parent or the Securityholders' Representative's position as his or her
final decision, and will not have the authority to modify either party's
position or render any substantive decision other than to so select the
position of either party as set forth in their respective written report (as
initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with this _Schedule_ _1.6_ ,
as applicable). The decision of the Mediator will be the sole, exclusive and
binding remedy between them regarding the dispute submitted to such Mediator.

  



  

 **(iv** ) Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative, the in-person portion (if any) of such
proceedings will be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts. The parties agree that
they will share equally the costs and fees of the Mediator in connection with
any proceeding under this _Schedule 1.6_ , including the cost of the
arbitration filing and hearing fees, the cost of any independent expert
retained by the arbitrator and the cost of the arbitrator and administrative
fees of JAMS if applicable. Each party will bear its own costs and attorneys'
and witnesses' fees and associated costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any proceeding under this _Schedule 1.6_.

  



  

   

  



  

 **(v) ** The parties will use, and will direct the Mediator to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve a dispute within forty-five (45)
days after the selection of the Mediator, or if resolution within forty-five
(45) days is not reasonably achievable, as determined by the Mediator, then as
soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable.
