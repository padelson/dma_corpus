i AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December
10, 2015, is made by and among Crealta Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Company_ "), Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("[ *** ]"), HZNP Limited, a private company limited by shares
organized under the laws of Ireland (the " _Purchaser_ ," and together with [
*** ], the " _Purchasers_ "), Criostail LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the " _Merger Sub_ "),
[ *** ], and GTCR Fund X/B LP, a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its
capacity as representative (the " _Representative_ ") for [ *** ] and
the Companys Unitholders and Optionholders (all of whom are listed on the
attached _Sellers Schedule_ , collectively, the " _Sellers_ "). Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in 
_Article_ _ _ _XI_ below.

WHEREAS, the Purchasers desire to acquire 100% of the membership interests of
the Company through [ *** ] a reverse subsidiary merger transaction pursuant
to which the Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser [ *** ], on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the " _Merger_ " and, together
with the Stock Purchase, the " _Transaction_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors or managers (or the equivalent
governing bodies) of the Purchasers, the Merger Sub, [ *** ] and the Company
have approved this Agreement, the Merger and/or the Stock Purchase (as
applicable) and the related transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Purchasers and Merger Subs willingness to enter into
this Agreement, each Seller listed on _Schedule A_ has executed and delivered
to the Purchaser a Joinder Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER AND THE STOCK PURCHASE_

 

1.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and
into the Company in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act
(as amended, " _Delaware LLC Law_ "),

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



2  whereupon the separate existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall be the surviving limited liability company (the " _Surviving
Company_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser [ *** ].

 

(b) At the Closing, the Company and the Merger Sub shall cause
a certificate of merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ _ _ _A_ hereto
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and shall make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware LLC Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_
") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in accordance with the Delaware LLC Law or at such later
time as the Purchaser and the Company mutually agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall succeed to all the assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
and be subject to all of the liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Company and the Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware LLC
Law.

 

1.02 _Conversion of Units_.

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any party:

 

(a) Each Unit (and the membership interests represented thereby)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(i) any Units (and the membership interests represented thereby) which are
held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the
Company or by the Purchasers or the Merger Sub, all of which shall cease to
be outstanding and be canceled for no consideration and none of which shall
receive any payment with respect thereto, and (ii) any Units (and the
membership interests represented thereby) which are held by [ *** ], all of
which shall be cancelled for no consideration and converted, without [ *** ]
receiving any payment with respect thereto, into membership interests in the
Surviving Company with a fair market value equal to the fair market value of
such Units held by [ *** ], as such membership interests are provided for by
the Surviving Company LLC Agreement) and all rights in respect thereof shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall cease to exist and shall be converted into and represent solely
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the
Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger Consideration attributable to such
Unit less the portion of the Representative Holdback Amount attributable to
such Unit, plus (B) any Additional Merger Consideration attributable to each
such Unit (as set forth in the Closing Payment Schedule), plus (C) any Escrow
Distribution attributable to such Unit (as set forth in the Closing Payment
Schedule). No further transfer of any Units shall be made on the Unit
Ownership Ledger after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any Units is presented to the
Surviving Company, the Purchaser or the Paying Agent (in accordance with
_Section_ _1.04_ ), such certificate shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged
as provided in this _Section _ _1.02_.

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



3 (b) Each membership interest of the Merger Sub (a " _Merger Sub
Interest_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into membership interests in the Surviving Company, as such
common units are provided for by the Surviving Company LLC Agreement. As of
the Effective Time, the Merger Sub Interests shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holder
or holders of such membership interests shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive membership interests in the
Surviving Company to be issued in consideration therefor as provided herein,
without interest. As of the Effective Time, the Purchaser and [ *** ] shall
be the holders of all the issued and outstanding units of the Surviving
Company.

 

1.03 _Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) At least [ *** ] Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a written statement, signed
by the Companys Chief Financial Officer (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ "),
containing its good faith calculation of its estimate of (i) Closing Date
Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount_ "), and (iv) Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated

Purchaser (including by giving the Purchaser an opportunity to provide
comments to the Pre-Closing Statement), shall work in good faith to resolve
any differences the Company and the Purchaser may have with respect to any of
the amounts or calculations set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement, and the
Company will make available to the Purchaser and its representatives the work
papers and other books and records used in preparing the Pre-
Closing Statement and afford the Purchaser and its representatives reasonable
access to the relevant personnel and its external representatives of the
Company to verify the accuracy of such amounts to the extent deemed reasonably
necessary by the Purchaser. 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver
to the Purchaser a spreadsheet (the " _Closing Payment Schedule_ "), duly
certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth:

 

(i) the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration;

(ii) with respect to each holder of Units immediately prior to the
Effective Time: (A) the name of such holder, (B) whether such holder is a

Closing Statement will be prepared and will be determined, on a consolidated
basis, in accordance with the terms of  _Section_ _ _ _2.01_ regarding the
preparation of the Preliminary Statement.

Consideration_ " means (i) $510,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_ "),

(a) The Purchaser shall cause a paying agent appointed by the
Purchaser, and reasonably acceptable to the Representative (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), to effect the exchange of cash for the Units which are entitled to
payment pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.02_. After the Effective Time,
each Unitholder who has surrendered his, her or its Units (together with a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Units) pursuant to a duly executed and completed letter of
transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit_ _ _ _B_ attached hereto
(each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), to the Paying Agent, shall be entitled
to receive from the Paying Agent in exchange therefor the portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration into which such Unitholders Units shall have

delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying
Agent in accordance with this _Section 1.04_ at least [ *** ] Business Days
prior to the Closing shall be paid such consideration by the Paying Agent as
promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within [ *** ] Business
Days of the Closing) and thereafter, as, when and if any Additional Merger
Consideration and/or Escrow Distribution is payable in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, such Unitholder shall be entitled to be paid the
Additional Merger Consideration and/or Escrow Distribution into which such
Unitholders Units shall have been converted as a result of the Merger as
determined pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.02_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Closing Merger Consideration with respect to Unallocated Units (less the
portion of the Representative Holdback Amount attributable to such Units) that

income Tax purposes prior to the date of this Agreement shall be paid through
the payroll system of the Surviving Company and/or its Subsidiaries in
accordance with _Section 3.02(d)_. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each
Unit shall represent solely the right to receive the Allocable Portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration attributable to such Unit (less the portion of
the Representative Holdback Amount attributable to such Unit), and any
Additional Merger Consideration and/or Escrow Distribution into which it was
converted pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _1.02_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any certificate representing such Units shall have been lost, stolen or

claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (which may include
an indemnity or bond in customary form), the Paying Agent and/or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration (less the applicable portion of the Representative Holdback
Amount) and any Additional Merger Consideration and/or Escrow Distribution to
be paid in respect of the Units represented by such certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article_ _ _ _I_.

anniversary of the Closing Date may, at the Purchasers request, be remitted
to the Surviving Company and thereafter any Unitholder shall direct any claims
for payment hereunder to the

6  Surviving Company as a general creditor thereof. Any such amounts remaining
unclaimed by any Unitholder immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of the
Purchaser, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.04_ , none of the Paying Agent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any
party hereto shall be liable for any amount properly paid to a public official
in compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

1.05 _Options_. The Company shall, as of the Effective Time, cause all
Options, whether or not then vested or exercisable, to be canceled and
extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right to
acquire Units, and in consideration therefor, the Optionholders shall
be entitled to receive with respect to each Option: (i) reasonably promptly
following the Effective Time an amount in cash, without interest and subject
to withholding pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _3.03_ below, equal to the product
of (A) the excess, if any, of the Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration attributable to each Unit that is subject to such Option over
the exercise price per Unit payable upon exercise of such Option, _multiplied_
by (B) the number of Units that would be issued upon exercise of such Option
if such holder had exercised such Option in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Option Consideration_ "), plus (ii) any
Additional Merger Consideration attributable to the Common Units underlying
such Option to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (as set forth in the Closing Payment Schedule), plus (iii) any
Escrow Distribution attributable to the Common Units underlying such Option
to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (as set

of the Company or the Merger Sub, the limited liability company agreement of
the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended and restated to read in its entirety as provided by _Exhibit_ _ _ _C_
and, commencing as of the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company (the " _Surviving Company LLC
Agreement_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein and by applicable
Law.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Companys board of managers shall

1.08 _Representative Holdback_. A portion of the proceeds otherwise to
be received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article_ _ _ _I_ in an aggregate
amount equal to $[ *** ] (such initial deposit, as it may be decreased at any
time in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Representative Holdback
Amount_ ") shall be delivered by the Purchasers to the Representative at the
Closing, on behalf of the Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a segregated account designated by the Representative (which account
shall be used only to hold the Representative Holdback Amount and to pay any
payments, fees, costs and expenses of the Representative payable by the
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement). The portion of the
Representative Holdback Amount delivered to, and held by, the Representative
on behalf of each such Seller shall be determined pro rata based upon each
Sellers Residual Percentage. The Representative is entitled to pay on behalf
of the Sellers, and to the extent paid by the Representative from its own
funds, obtain reimbursement for, any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Representative in the performance of its duties
hereunder (" _Representative Expenses_ ") from the Representative Holdback
Amount, and the Representative shall not use any portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount for any other purpose. For all purposes of this Agreement,
any and all amounts paid by the Purchasers to the Representative pursuant to
this _Section_ _ _ _1.08_ or otherwise in respect of the Representative
Holdback Amount shall be deemed to have been paid to the Sellers and in no
event shall the Purchasers or any of their Affiliates have any further
obligation or Liability to any Seller in respect thereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, any amounts paid by the Purchasers to the Representative in respect of
the Representative Holdback Amount shall be treated for Tax purposes as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Sellers at the time of
payment by the Purchasers, and any Tax withholding with respect to such deemed
contribution by any Seller shall be satisfied from such Sellers share of
other funds payable to such Seller at such time and shall not reduce the
Representative Holdback Amount.

 

1.09 _No Dissenter s Rights or Appraisal Rights_. No holder of
Units or Options shall be entitled to any "dissenters rights," "appraisal
rights" or any similar remedies under Delaware LLC Law or any other applicable
Law. Following the Effective Time, each holder of any Units and/or Options
shall be entitled only to the right to receive the appropriate portion of the

entitled to receive, as consideration for the Shares, [ *** ] Residual
Percentage of such Additional Merger Consideration and/or Escrow Distribution

 _MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT_

 

2.01 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. As promptly as
possible, but in any event within [ *** ] days after the Closing Date, the
Purchasers will deliver to the Representative unaudited consolidated balance
sheets of [ *** ] and of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheets_ ") and a statement
showing the calculation of Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness and
Net Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance Sheets and the
Transaction Expenses (together with the Closing Balance Sheets, the "
_Preliminary Statement_ "). The calculation of Net Working Capital in the
Preliminary Statement shall be prepared in accordance with (i) GAAP, and shall
not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) to the extent not
inconsistent with clause (i), the accounting methods, policies,
categorizations, definitions, principles, assets recognition bases, practices,
techniques and procedures (including in respect of managements exercise of
judgment) adopted in connection with the latest balance sheet included in the
Audited Financial Statements. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing
the Closing Balance Sheets and determining Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness and Net Working Capital and the related purchase price
adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.01_ is to (A) measure the amount
of Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Indebtedness and (B) measure changes in
Net Working Capital against the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such
processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments,
accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the
Closing Balance Sheets or determining Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness or Net Working Capital; provided, in each case, that the
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications and estimation methodologies used in preparing the Pre-
Closing Statement and determining Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness and
Estimated Net Working Capital were consistent with the requirements set forth
in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above. The Representative and its accountants
and other representatives shall be permitted reasonable access during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice to review [ *** ] the Companys
and its Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers related to
the preparation of the Preliminary Statement and the adjustments contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
business operations of the Purchasers, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates and that the Persons

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



9  provided such access shall treat any confidential or proprietary information
of [ *** ] the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
received in connection therewith as confidential and shall not disclose such
information to any third party. The Representative and its accountants and
other representatives may make reasonable inquires of the Purchasers, the
Surviving Company and their respective accountants regarding questions or
disagreements, and the Purchasers shall use their, and shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such accountants to reasonably cooperate with and
respond to such inquiries. If the Representative objects in good faith to any
item on the Preliminary Statement, the Representative shall deliver to the
Purchasers a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an " _Objections
Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser
within [ *** ] days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the
Representative, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. The Objections Statement must set forth in
reasonable detail (A) any item on the Preliminary Statement which
the Representative reasonably believes has not been prepared in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Representatives determination of the
amount of such item and (B) the Representatives alternative calculation of
the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Transaction
Expenses and/or the Net Working Capital, as the case may be, together with all
relevant supporting documentation. Any item or amount that the Representative
does not dispute in the Objections Notice within such [ *** ] day period
shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If an
Objections Statement is timely delivered, the Representative and the
Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections set
forth therein, but if they do not reach a final resolution within [ *** ] days
after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Representative and the
Purchaser shall submit such dispute to [ *** ] (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").
Any further submissions to the Accounting Firm must be written and delivered
to each party to the dispute. The Accounting Firm shall make a final
determination of Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital and Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Merger Consideration
calculated with reference to such amounts to the extent such amounts are in
dispute (and have been reflected on an Objections Statement), in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on
_Exhibit_ _ _ _D_. The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. If an
Objections Statement is delivered to the Accounting Firm for resolution, the
determination of Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital and/or Transaction Expenses, as the case may be, and the resulting
Final Merger Consideration calculated with reference thereto, shall become
final and binding on the parties on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its
final resolution in writing to the parties.

 

2.02 _Post_ __ _-Closing  Adjustment Payment_. If the Final Merger
Consideration is greater than the Closing Merger Consideration, (a) the
Representative shall deliver to the Purchasers an updated Closing Payment
Schedule (which need not be certified by an officer of the Company) setting
forth the portion of such excess amount payable to each Seller and (b) the
Purchasers shall promptly (but in any event within [ *** ] Business Days after
the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration and receipt of the
updated Closing Payment Schedule) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying
Agent (for further payment to the Sellers other than Optionholders) and the
Surviving Company (for further payment to the Optionholders in accordance
with  _Section 3.02(k)_ ), on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers
Residual Percentage, the amount of such excess in accordance with the Closing
Payment Schedule, by

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



10  wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated by the Paying Agent and the Surviving Company. If the Final Merger
Consideration is less than the Closing Merger Consideration, the
Representative shall promptly (but in any event within [ *** ] Business Days
after the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration) pay on behalf
of the Sellers (on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers Residual
Percentage) to the Purchasers the absolute value of such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in
writing by the Purchasers.

_provided_ , any disclosure set forth in any Schedule shall be considered to
have been set forth in each other Schedule and shall be deemed to modify the
representations and warranties in this _Article_ _ _ _V_ , in each case, if

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the Company has all

failure to hold such authorizations, licenses and permits would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is qualified to do business in every
jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the conduct of business as
now conducted requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
heretofore made available to the Purchaser complete and correct copies of its
Governing Documents (including the Company LLC Agreement) as in effect through

(h) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchasers and
the Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing of

the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding or any tax planning,
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.

 

(i) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) At its election, the Representative, on behalf of the Sellers,

litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any
member of the Company Group (each, a " _Tax Claim_ ") that relates solely to
one or more taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Purchaser and the Surviving Company will have the
right, directly or through its designated representatives, to review in
advance and comment upon all submissions made in the course of such Tax
Claims (including any administrative appeals thereof), and the Representative
shall not dispose of any Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Purchaser shall, at its own expense, be permitted to participate
in any Tax Claim controlled by the Representative. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any limits on indemnification hereunder would materially limit
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties recovery for the expected potential Damages
arising under a Tax Claim, the Purchaser shall be entitled to control of the
Tax Claim with counsel of its own choosing, provided that in all cases the
Representative

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



58   shall be permitted to elect to control any U.S. federal or state income Tax
audit of the Company for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Representative does not elect to
defend a Tax Claim to which it is entitled to assume control pursuant to this
_Section 9.03(i)(i)_ , the reasonable third party out-of-pocket expenses

exclusive source of recovery for indemnification claims under _Section
12.02(a)_ [ *** ]; _provided_ , that in no event shall any Sellers aggregate

acknowledge that there shall not be any duplicative recovery for any Damages
arising from the same facts and circumstances.

***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



75  for which it would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under _Section
12.02(a)_ exceeds $[ *** ] (the " _Per Claim Deductible_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that (i) any claim for an amount of less than the Per
Claim Deductible shall be disregarded in determining whether the Indemnity
Deductible has been exceeded and (ii) any Damage or Damages resulting from any
single claim or series of related claims arising out of or resulting from the
same facts, events, or circumstances shall be deemed to be one and the same
claim for these purposes and shall be aggregated in determining whether the
Per Claim Deductible was exceeded); _provided_ _, _ that the Per Claim
Deductible shall not apply to (i) any claims for fraud or (ii) any Damages
related to the inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations or the Tax Representations.

any Damages under _Section 12.02(a)_ unless and until the aggregate Damages in
excess of the Per Claim Deductible for which they would otherwise be entitled
to indemnification under _Section 12.02(a)_ exceed $[ *** ] (the " _Indemnity
Deductible_ ") (at which point the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall become
entitled to be indemnified only for such Damages in excess of the Indemnity
Deductible); _provided_ _,_ that the Indemnity Deductible shall not apply to
(i) any claims for fraud or (ii) any Damages related to the inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or the Tax Representations. 

(d) For purposes of _Section 12.02(a)_ , a breach shall be determined
without regard to any qualification based on materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifier contained in such representation or warranty (or
in any defined term contained in such representation or warranty other than
the first sentence of _Section 5.06_ and the definition of "Material Adverse
Effect" in _Article_ _ _ _XI_. Additionally, a Purchaser Indemnified Partys
entitlement to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement will not be
affected by any examination made for or on behalf of any of such parties or
the knowledge of any of their respective officers, directors, Affiliates,
employees, agents or representatives.

 

(e) No Seller shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for
any Damages to the extent such Damages constitute punitive damages, except to
the extent such punitive damages are sought or obtained by a third party.

 

(f) The amount of any Damages that are subject to indemnification
under this _Article XII_ shall be calculated net of the amount of any
insurance proceeds, contribution, indemnification payments or similar payments
or reimbursements actually received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
respect of such Damages (net of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining
such insurance, indemnification or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums or retro-premium adjustments resulting from such recovery),
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 12.03(f)_ shall be construed as or
give rise to an obligation to seek any such insurance, indemnification or
reimbursement. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any right of
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Damages or alleged Damages to
the extent that the Damage or alleged Damage is included in the calculation of
Net Working Capital or deducted as Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses in the

proceeds received by the Sellers pursuant to _Article I_ of this Agreement.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
any indemnification for Taxes attributable to transactions occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing outside the Ordinary Course of Business (other
than as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement) or transactions that occur
or are deemed to occur at or immediately prior to or immediately following the
Closing that are solely attributable to Purchasers financing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.04 _Indemnification Claims Procedure_.

 

(a) If a Purchaser Indemnified Party determines in good faith that
such Purchaser Indemnified Party has a bona fide claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _XII_ , then the Purchaser (on behalf of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party) shall deliver to the Representative a written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") (i) stating that a Purchaser Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_ , (ii) to the
extent possible, providing a good faith non-binding, preliminary estimate of
the amount of indemnifiable Damages such Purchaser Indemnified Party claims
to have incurred or suffered or could reasonably be expected to incur or
suffer (the " _Estimated Claim Amount_ "); and (iii) specifying in reasonable
detail (based upon the information then possessed by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party) the material facts known to the Purchaser Indemnified Party
giving rise to such claim. Subject to this _Article XII_ , no delay in
providing such a Claim Notice shall affect a Purchaser Indemnified Partys
rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent that) the Sellers are
actually and materially prejudiced by such delay. At the time of delivery of
any Claim Notice, the Purchaser shall deliver a duplicate copy of such Claim
Notice to the Escrow Agent (on behalf of the applicable Purchaser Indemnified
Party).

 

(b) If the Representative in good faith objects to any claim made in
a Claim Notice, then the Representative shall deliver a written notice (a "
_Claim Dispute Notice_ ") to the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent during the [
*** ] calendar day period commencing upon receipt by the Representative
of the Claim Notice. The Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the principal basis for the dispute of any claim made in the relevant
Claim Notice. If no Claim Dispute Notice is delivered prior to the expiration
of such [ *** ] calendar day period, then (i) each claim for indemnification
set forth in such Claim Notice shall be deemed to have been conclusively
determined in favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Party for purposes of this
_Article XII_ on the terms set forth in the Claim Notice and (ii) as
applicable, if any funds remain in the Escrow Account, then the Purchaser may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, direct the Escrow Agent to deliver cash
from the Escrow Account to the Purchaser in accordance with this _Section
12.04_ , or as otherwise required pursuant to this _Article XII_ , the Sellers
shall make payment to the Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of the
Damages set forth in such Claim Notice.

 

(c) Following delivery of a Claim Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and
the Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such objections
raised in such Claim Dispute Notice. If the Purchaser and the Representative
agree to a resolution of such objection,

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



77  then (i) a memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined by
the Purchaser and the Representative shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and (ii) as applicable, if such memorandum calls for a payment to a
Purchaser Indemnified Party and any funds remain in the Escrow Account, the
Purchaser may, in its sole and absolute discretion, direct the Escrow Agent to
act in accordance with such memorandum and distribute cash from the Escrow
Account in accordance therewith, or as otherwise required pursuant to this
_Article XII_ , the Sellers shall make payment to the Purchaser Indemnified
Party in accordance with such memorandum.

 

(d) If no such resolution can be reached during the [ *** ] calendar
day period following receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon the
expiration of such [ *** ] calendar day period, either the Purchaser or the
Representative may bring suit to resolve the objection in accordance with
_Sections 12.14_ and _12.18_ and _12.19_. The decision of the trial court as
to the validity and amount of any claim in such Claim Notice shall be non-
appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Purchaser and the Sellers. As
applicable, if such decision calls for a payment to a Purchaser Indemnified
Party and any funds remain in the Escrow Account, the Purchaser may, in its
sole and absolute discretion, direct the Escrow Agent to act in accordance
with such decision and distribute cash from the Escrow Account in accordance
therewith, or as otherwise required pursuant to this _Article_ _ _ _XII_ , the
Sellers shall make payment to the Purchaser Indemnified Party in accordance
with such decision. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be
entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

 

12.05 _Third Party Claims_. In the event of the assertion of any actual
or possible Proceeding that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third
party against a Purchaser Indemnified Party and that may be subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (each, a "Third-Party Claim"), the
Purchaser shall proceed with the defense of such Third-Party Claim on its own
(and the costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the
defense, settlement or resolution of such Third-Party Claim (including
reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court
or arbitration costs) may be included in the Damages for which the Purchaser
may seek indemnification pursuant to a claim made hereunder). Representative
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to the Purchasers claim
for indemnification under this Agreement at Representatives expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with reputable
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser; provided that Representative
shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained
herein; and provided further that Representative shall not have the right to
assume control of such defense if (i) the claim which Representative seeks to
control (a) involves a claim that is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the reputation, customer or supplier relations or future
business prospects of the Purchasers, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, (b) seeks equitable or injunctive relief, except where
equitable or injunctive relief is incidental to a primary claim or claims for
monetary damages and such claim is not reasonably likely to result in
equitable or injunctive relief, (c) is brought by a Governmental Entity, (d)
involves criminal allegations or (e) would reasonably be expected to result in
greater liability to Purchaser Indemnified Parties than the Sellers, taking
into account the Indemnity Deductible, the Escrow Amount and other limitations
on indemnification herein or (ii) the Representative (or counsel selected by
Representative) has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend such claim,
and is provided written notice of such failure by the Purchaser Indemnified
Party and such failure is not reasonably cured within [ *** ] Business Days of
receipt of

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



78  such notice. In the event that the Representative assumes the defense of any
Third-Party Claim pursuant to the prior sentence, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with
separate counsel at the Purchasers expense. Neither the Purchaser nor
Representative shall not have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
Third-Party Claim without the consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it being agreed that
the other party shall consent to any settlement, adjustment or compromise of
such Proceeding unless the settlement will result in injunctive or
other equitable relief being imposed against the Sellers, on the one hand, or
against the Purchaser or any member of the Company Group, on the other, as the
case may be, or the settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release
the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser or the Company Group, on the
other, as applicable, from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such Third-Party Claim without prejudice, except for payments that would be
required to be paid by Representative representing the Indemnity Deductible
and/or the Per Claim Deductible. The Purchasers shall give the Representative
prompt notice of the commencement of any such Third-Party Claim against a
Purchaser Indemnified Party; provided, that any failure on the part of the
Purchaser to so notify the Representative shall not limit any of the
obligations of the Sellers pursuant to this Article XII (except and only to
the extent such failure actually and materially prejudices the defense of
such Third-Party Claim). For the avoidance of doubt, Tax Claims shall be
subject to _Section 9.03(i)_ rather than this _Section 12.05_.

 

12.06 _Release of Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) On the [ *** ] Business Day following the termination of the
Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall release the then remaining Escrow Funds
(to the extent such funds have not been utilized to pay the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for any indemnification claims under this _Article XII_ )
to (i) the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Sellers (other than
the Optionholders in respect of Options) and (ii) the Surviving Company (or
any successor thereto) for further distribution to the Optionholders in
respect of the Options, in each case, in accordance with _Section 1.04_ and
_Section 1.05_ , as applicable; provided, that the Escrow Agent shall retain
an amount (up to the total amount of the then remaining Escrow Funds) equal
to the amount of any claims for indemnification asserted in good faith prior
to the termination of the Escrow Period but which are not yet resolved (each
such claim, an "Unresolved Claim"). The amount of the Escrow Funds retained
for each Unresolved Claim shall be released (to the extent such funds are not
utilized to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for such Unresolved
Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) by the Escrow Agent to
the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, in accordance with
the prior sentence upon the final and binding resolution of such Unresolved
Claim in accordance with this Article XII and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at least [ *** ]
Business Days prior to any Escrow Distribution to the Sellers, the
Representative shall deliver to the Purchasers an updated Closing Payment
Schedule (which need not be certified by an officer of the Company) setting
forth the portion of such Escrow Distribution payable to each Seller.

79 12.07 _Representative_.

 

(a) _Authority_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to
the Delaware LLC Law, the Sellers hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint
the Representative as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact
for each of the Sellers for all purposes authorized under this Agreement,
including the full power and authority on the Sellers behalf (i)
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein; (ii) to pay such Sellers
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of this
Agreement (whether incurred on or after the date hereof), including by using
funds from the Representative Holdback Amount; (iii) to disburse any funds
received hereunder to such Seller and each other Seller; (iv) to endorse and
deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Units and execute
such further instruments of assignment as the Purchaser or the Merger Sub
shall reasonably request; (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller
any amendment or waiver hereto; (vi) (A) to dispute or refrain from disputing,
or to deliver instructions, on behalf of such Seller relative to any amounts
to be received by such Seller under any Transaction Document or any other
agreement contemplated hereby or thereby, any claim made by the Purchaser
under any Transaction Document or any other agreement contemplated hereby or
thereby, (B) to negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such Seller, any
dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising any
remedies available under, the Transaction Documents or any other
agreement contemplated hereby or thereby (including pursuant to _Article_ _ _
_XII_ of this Agreement), and (C) to execute, on behalf of such Seller, any
settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to such dispute
or remedy; (vii) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or consultants on
behalf of the Sellers in connection with the Transaction Documents or any
other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby and paying any fees related
thereto; (viii) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such
Seller in connection herewith; (ix) to retain the Representative Holdback
Amount and pay amounts therefrom in accordance with this Agreement; and (x) to
do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such Seller or
the Sellers collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall not have the
authority to agree to any amendment of this Agreement or enter into any
agreement or take any of the foregoing actions that would treat any Units
differently than other Units. Each of the Sellers agrees that such agency and
proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the
consent of the Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. If any Seller dies or
becomes incapacitated, disabled or incompetent (such deceased, incapacitated,
disabled or incompetent Seller being a " _Former Seller_ ") and, as a result,
the agency and power of attorney conferred by this  _Section_ _ _ _12.07_ is
revoked by operation of law, it shall not be a breach by such Former Seller
under this Agreement if the heirs, beneficiaries, estate, administrator,
executor, guardian, conservator or other legal representative of such Former
Seller (each a " _Successor Seller_ ") confirms the appointment of the
Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for such Successor Seller. All
decisions and actions by the Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 

(b) _Authority; Indemnification._ Each Seller agrees that the
Purchasers, the Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to rely
on any action taken by the Representative, on behalf of such Seller, pursuant
to _Section_ _ _ _12.07(a)_ above (an " _Authorized_

 



80   _Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each
Seller as fully as if such Seller had taken such Authorized Action. The
Purchasers and the Merger Sub agree that the Representative, as the
Representative, shall have no Liability to the Purchaser and the Merger Sub
for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such Authorized Action is
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or
willful misconduct. Each Seller hereby severally (based on such Sellers
Residual Percentage), for itself only and not jointly and severally, agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Representative against all fees, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and
amounts incurred by the Representative in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding to which the Representative is made a party by reason of the fact
it is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(c) _Exculpation_. The Representative shall not have by reason
of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in
respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. The Representative shall
not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by it or any
agent employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in
connection herewith, except that the Representative shall not be relieved of
any Liability imposed by law for willful misconduct. The Representative shall
not be liable to the Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments
made by the Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole
recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to
recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they
are determined to have been entitled. The Representative shall not be required
to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of
the terms, provision or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any Liability to any
Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Representative for any
reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud or bad faith.

 

(d) _Representative Holdback Amount_. The Representative will be
entitled to obtain reimbursement from the Representative Holdback Amount for
any payments, fees, costs and expenses of the Representative payable by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement and will distribute in
its discretion any remaining portion of the Representative Holdback Amount to
the Sellers on a pro rata basis according to each Sellers Residual
Percentage, it being understood and agreed that such distribution(s) shall be
the responsibility of the Representative only and that neither the Purchaser
nor the Surviving Company shall have any obligation to ensure that such
distribution is, or distributions are, made.

 

12.08 _Press Releases and Communications_. Other than delivery
of an information memorandum to the Sellers by the Company regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being agreed that the Company
shall give the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such information memorandum and the Company shall give reasonable
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Purchaser), no press release or public announcement related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, shall be issued or
made by any party hereto (or any Affiliate to a party hereto) without the
joint approval of the Purchaser and the Representative, unless required by
Law (in the reasonable advice of counsel), court order or by

 



81  obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange or trading market on which securities of the Purchasers or
any of their Affiliates are listed, in which case the Purchaser and the
Representative, as the case may be, shall have the right to review such press
release, announcement or communication prior to issuance, distribution or
publication.

 

12.09 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
Company and the Representative, on the one hand, and the Purchasers and the
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall pay all of their own expenses (including
attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of their obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that the Purchasers shall pay the Transaction Expenses
on behalf of [ *** ] and the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in
_Section_ _ _ _3.02(i)_.

 

12.10 _Knowledge Defined_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "the
Companys knowledge" and "knowledge of the Company" as used herein shall mean
the actual knowledge, of each of [ *** ] and (b) "the Purchasers knowledge"
as used herein shall mean the actual knowledge of [ *** ]

12.11 _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be
given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally
delivered, (b) when transmitted via facsimile device to the number set out
below if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by
a recognized overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (c) the day
following the day (except if not a Business Day then the next Business Day)
on which the same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight
air courier service or (d) the third Business Day following the day on which
the same is sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid. Notices,

Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid

by Splitter LP upon completion of the Splitter LP Liquidation and (ii) grants

this Agreement.

12.19 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF

.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail as a defense to the formation of a contract and
each such party forever waives any such defense.

 

12.22 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in

12.23 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning
the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this
Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of [ *** ], without giving effect to

such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in
_Section_ _ _ _12.11_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

 

12.25 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions

Company or the Representative, as applicable, in accordance with their

  Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of January 13, 2016, ("Merger Agreement"), by and among Crealta Holdings LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company ("Company"), Criostail LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company ("Merger Sub"), Horizon Pharma USA, Inc., a
Delaware corporation [ *** ], HZNP Limited, a private company limited by
shares organized under the laws of Ireland ("Purchaser," and together with [
*** ], "Purchasers"), [ *** ] and GTCR Fund X/B LP, a Delaware limited
partnership. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the
meanings specified in the Merger Agreement.

 

In connection with the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company pursuant to
the Merger Agreement (the "Merger"), and as part of the transactions
described in the Merger Agreement, the undersigned hereby surrenders the
below-described unit certificate(s) (the "Certificate(s)") representing the
Companys Units ("Company Units"), in exchange for the right to receive, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, an
amount of cash equal to the Allocable Portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration attributable to such Company Unit plus any Additional Merger
Consideration attributable to such Company Unit plus any Escrow Distribution
attributable to such Company Unit, at the times specified therein.

 

The undersigned (i) acknowledges that the undersigned has reviewed the Merger
Agreement, and understands that the only consideration that the undersigned
may be entitled to receive with respect to the undersigneds Company Units in
connection with the Merger is the consideration pursuant to the Merger
Agreement (ii) consents to to the adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) irrevocably waives
any right of dissent under applicable law and (iv) affirms the undersigneds
appointment of the Representative (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) pursuant to Section 12.07I of the Merger Agreement (including the
limitations set forth therein), which is incorporated by reference herein.

 

The undersigned acknowledges that, until surrendered in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding certificate representing
Company Units will be deemed from and after the effective time of the Merger,
for all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive cash amounts on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

Unless otherwise indicated, the name and address of the owner of the Company
Units represented by the Certificate(s) are correctly identified in the table
entitled "Description of Units Surrendered" below. The undersigned represents
and warrants that the undersigned is the owner of such units or has full power
and authority to surrender the Certificate(s) on behalf of such owner, free
and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances. The undersigned will, upon
request, execute and deliver any additional documents (the "Additional
Documents") reasonably deemed appropriate or necessary by Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company (the "Paying Agent") in connection with the surrender
of the Certificate(s), and hereby permits the Paying Agent to send a copy of
this Letter of Transmittal and any Additional Documents to the Purchaser. All
authority conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of Transmittal
shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the undersigneds death or
incapacity, and all of the undersigneds obligations under this Letter of
Transmittal shall be binding upon the undersigneds successors, assigns,
heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.

 

The undersigned understands that surrender of the Certificate(s) will not be
in acceptable form until receipt by the Paying Agent of this Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and signed with an original signature, together
with all and any Certificate(s).

 

All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of the
Certificate(s) hereunder will be determined by the Purchaser (which may
delegate power in whole or in part to the Paying Agent) in its reasonable
discretion and such determination shall be final and binding. The undersigned
understands that delivery of any cash amounts to which the holder of the
Certificate(s) is entitled will be made as promptly as practicable after
surrender of the Certificate(s) along with the properly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the actual amount
of consideration to be received by the undersigned is subject to adjustment
and the results of certain post-Closing items. The undersigned understands and
agrees that a portion of the consideration to which the undersigned may be
entitled under the Merger Agreement will be included in (i) escrow funds that
will be delivered to an escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") and held in
escrow pursuant to Section 3.02(e) of the Merger Agreement

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested  and the terms of the escrow agreement executed among the Escrow Agent, the
Representative, the Purchaser and certain other parties thereto on the closing
of the Merger (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), with such amounts to be disbursed
by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and (ii) a
holdback amount which will be delivered to the Representative and held by the
Representative pursuant to Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement, with such
amount to be disbursed by the Representative in accordance with the Merger
Agreement. The undersigned further understands that the undersigned may in the
future become entitled to receive all, a portion or none of the cash
deposited in escrow with the Escrow Agent and of the holdback amount held by
the Representative pursuant to Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement.

 

The undersigned hereby acknowledges receipt of the documents delivered with
this Letter of Transmittal, including, without limitation the Merger
Agreement and a Form W-9 or Form W-8 (collectively with this Letter of
Transmittal, the " _Specified Documents_ "). The undersigned acknowledges that
the undersigned has had the opportunity to review the Specified Documents,
that the undersigned has consulted, or had the full opportunity to consult,
with independent legal, tax, accounting, regulatory and financial advisors
regarding the undersigneds rights and obligations under the Specified
Documents and that the undersigned fully understands the terms and conditions
contained, and the transactions provided for, herein and therein. The
undersigned further acknowledges and agrees to follow the instructions in the
"Instructions" section in this Letter of Transmittal.

The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Representative
as the true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact of the undersigned
with respect to the Company Units listed in the "Description of Units
Surrendered" section of this Letter of Transmittal, and any and all rights
represented thereby, with full power of substitution and resubstitution (such
power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an
interest) and authority, to act in the name, place and stead of the
undersigned for purposes of executing any documents and taking any actions
that the Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate within the bounds of the Representatives
authority under the express terms of the Merger Agreement, including in
connection with any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
under Article XII of the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby (subject to the limitations set forth therein). The
authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall not be affected
by, and shall survive, the death, incapacity or dissolution of the
undersigned, and all grants, appointments, acknowledgments, conveyances,
deliveries, waivers and obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall be
binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, trustees in bankruptcy,
personal and legal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.
This transmittal, and the surrender of Company Unit(s) transmitted by this
Letter of Transmittal, are irrevocable, provided that, if the Transaction is
not consummated, this Letter of Transmittal will be returned to the
undersigned.

The provisions of this Letter of Transmittal may be amended or waived only
with the prior written consent of the Company, the Representative and the
undersigned.

 

 THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 

The undersigned understands and agrees that the method of delivery of the
Company Units and this Letter of Transmittal is at the election and risk of
the holder of the Company Units. The undersigned hereby acknowledges that the
undersigned has read the "Instructions" section in this Letter of Transmittal.

 

With respect to the undersigneds surrendered Company Units, this Letter of
Transmittal shall be void and of no force and effect if the Closing pursuant
to the Merger Agreement fails to occur for any reason and the Merger Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

The undersigned hereby (i) forever waives all dissenters, appraisal or
similar rights under Delaware law and any other applicable laws, and (ii)
withdraws all written objections to the Merger and/or demands for appraisal,
if any, with respect to the Company Units owned by the undersigned.       |  |

 INSTRUCTIONS

 

 _Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s)._

 

 This Letter of Transmittal or a facsimile hereof, filled in and signed with
an original signature, must be used in connection with the delivery and
surrender of the Certificate(s). A Letter of Transmittal and the
Certificate(s) must be received by the Paying Agent, in satisfactory form, in
order to make an effective surrender. Delivery of the Certificate(s) and
other documents shall be effected, and the risk of loss and title to the
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate(s) to
the Paying Agent. The method of delivery of the Certificate(s) and other
documents is at the election and risk of the unitholder. If such delivery is
by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured, is
recommended. Surrender may be made by mail, by hand or by overnight courier to
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Paying Agent, at the address
shown above.

_Terms of Conversion of the Units._

 

 Each Company Unit (as shown in the box on the first page of this Letter of
Transmittal) will be converted at the effective time of the Merger into the
right to receive the cash amounts as set forth and described in the Merger
Agreement, without interest, and subject to applicable withholding.

 

 _Guarantee of Signature._

 

 The Certificate(s) need not be endorsed and unit powers and signature
guarantees are unnecessary unless (a) the Certificate(s) is registered in a
name other than that of the person surrendering the Certificate(s) or (b) such
registered holder completes the Special Payment Instructions or Special
Delivery Instructions. In the case of (a) above, any such Certificate(s) must
be duly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed unit power with the
signature on the endorsement or unit power and on the Letter of Transmittal
guaranteed by a participant in the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program,
the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the
Stock Exchange Medallion Program (each, an "Eligible Institution"). In the
case of (b) above, only the signature on the Letter of Transmittal should be
similarly guaranteed.

 

 _Signatures on Letter of Transmittal and Endorsements._

 

 The signature must correspond with the name as written on the face of the
Certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever.

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a trustee, executor, administrator,
guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation or other person acting
in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such person should so indicate when
signing, and proper evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent of
the authority of such person so to act must be submitted.

_Unit Transfer Taxes._

 

 If any payment for surrendered Company Units is to be made to any person(s)
other than the person whose name is written on the face of the Certificate(s)
representing such surrendered Company Units, it shall be a condition of the
issuance and delivery of such check that the amount of any unit transfer taxes
(whether imposed on the named unitholder or such person(s)) payable on
account of the transfer (or transfers) of the surrendered Company Units shall
be delivered to the Paying Agent or satisfactory evidence of the payment of
such taxes or nonapplicability thereof shall be submitted to the Paying Agent
before such check will be issued.

_Validity of Surrender, Irregularities._

 

 All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
Company Units hereby will be determined by Purchaser (which may delegate
power in whole or in part to the Paying Agent) and such determination shall be
final and binding; _provided_ that if there are any defects in the surrender
of the Certificate(s), Purchaser or the Paying Agent shall give notice
of such defects to the named unitholder. Purchaser reserve the right to waive
any  irregularities or defects in the surrender of any Company Units and its
interpretations of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and of
this Letter of Transmittal (including these instructions) with respect to
such irregularities or defects shall be final and binding. A surrender will
not be deemed to have been made until all irregularities have been cured or
waived.

 

 _Special Payment Instructions._

 

 Indicate the name (and address) to which payment for the Company Units is to
be made if different from the name of the person(s) signing this Letter of
Transmittal. This transfer requires a Medallion Guarantee Program stamp which
can be found at most banks and brokerages. _Requests for Information or Additional Copies._

 

 Information or additional copies of this Letter of Transmittal may be
obtained from the Paying Agent by writing to the address on the front of this
Letter of Transmittal or by calling the Paying Agent at (917) 262-2378.

_Inadequate Space._

 

 If the space provided on this Letter of Transmittal is inadequate, the
Company Unit certificate numbers and number of Company Units should be listed
on a separate signed schedule affixed hereto.

_Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of Certificate(s); Lost
Certificate(s)._

 You will not receive any consideration for your Company Units unless and
until you deliver this Letter of Transmittal or a facsimile hereof, duly
completed and signed, with original signature to the Paying Agent, together
with the Certificate(s) representing such Company Units and any required
accompanying evidences of authority in form satisfactory to Purchaser. If the
Certificate(s) has (have) been lost or destroyed, such fact should be
indicated on the face of this Letter of Transmittal. In such event, the Paying
Agent will forward additional documentation and instructions necessary to be
completed in order to effectively surrender the Company Units represented by
such lost or destroyed Certificate(s) (including instructions relating to
payment by holder of such lost or destroyed Certificate(s) of an
indemnity/surety bond premium equal to 3% of the cash value of the Company
Units represented by such Certificate(s) with a minimum of $100.00. No
interest will be paid on amounts due for the Company Units.

 

 _11_. _ Form W-9._ Each unitholder surrendering Units for payment is
required to provide the Paying Agent with such holders correct Taxpayer
Identification Number ("TIN") and certain other information on a Form W-9
(included in this Letter of Transmittal), or an appropriate IRS Form W-8, as
described below. Failure to provide such information or an adequate basis for
exemption from backup withholding on the form may subject such holder to
federal income tax withholding on cash payments made with respect to
certificates by the Payor (as defined below). Please consult the instructions
to the enclosed Form W-9 for instructions on how to complete the Form W-9. IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

 

United States federal income tax law generally requires that if your units are
accepted for payment and you are a U.S. Person (as defined below), you or
your assignee (in either case, the "Payee"), must provide Purchaser (the
"Payor") with the Payees correct TIN, which, in the case of a Payee who is an
individual, is generally the Payees social security number. If the Payor is
not provided with the correct TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, the
Payee may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the IRS and backup
withholding in an amount equal to 28% (or the then-prevailing rate) of the
proceeds received by the Payee pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of a person subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount withheld by the Payor (through the
Paying Agent). If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may
be obtained from the IRS, _provided_ the appropriate information and forms are
provided to the IRS and other requirements are satisfied.

 

To prevent backup withholding, each Payee that is a U.S. Person must provide
such Payees correct TIN by completing the Form W-9 set forth herein,
certifying that (i) the TIN provided is correct, (ii) (a) the Payee is exempt
from backup withholding, (b) the Payee has not been notified by the IRS that
such Payee is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to
report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified the payee that
such Payee is no longer subject to backup withholding, and (iii) the Payee is
a U.S. Person (including a U.S. resident alien). For these purposes, a "U.S.
Person" is (a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, (b)
a partnership, corporation, company or association created or organized in the
United States or under the laws of the United States, (c) an estate (other
than a foreign estate), or (d) a domestic U.S. trust (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-7)).

 

If the Payee does not have a TIN, such Payee should apply for and receive a
TIN prior to submitting the Form W-9; please consult the instructions to the
enclosed Form W-9 (the "W-9 Instructions") for instructions on applying for a
TIN. If the Payee does not provide such Payees TIN to the Payor by the time
of payment, backup withholding will apply.

If the Company Units are held in more than one name or held in a name other
than the name of the actual owner, consult the W-9 Instructions for
information on which TIN to report.

Exempt Payees are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. To prevent possible erroneous backup withholding, an exempt
Payee that is a U.S. Person should check the "exempt from backup withholding"
box on the Form W-9. See the W-9 Instructions for additional instructions. In

8. _Management_. 

 

(a) All management powers over the business and affairs of
the Company shall be exclusively vested in a board of managers (the " _Board_
") appointed from time to time by the Members, and the Board shall conduct,
direct and exercise full control over all activities of the Company. Each
member of the Board is referred to herein as a " _Manager_." The Managers
shall be the "managers" of the Company for the purposes of the Act. The Board
has the full power on the Companys behalf, in its name, to manage,
control, administer and operate its business and affairs and to do or cause
to be done anything necessary or appropriate for the Companys business. The
Managers are hereby designated as authorized persons, within the meaning of
the Act, to execute, deliver and file the certificate of formation of the
Company and all other certificates (and any amendments and/or restatements
hereof) required or permitted by the Act to be filed in the Office of the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 

(b) The initial number of Managers shall be two (2). The number of
Managers of the Company shall be fixed from time to time by the Members. The
initial Managers shall be Timothy P. Walbert and Paul W. Hoelscher. Each
Manager shall hold his office for the term for which he was appointed
and thereafter until his successor shall have been appointed, or until his
earlier death, resignation or removal. A Manager need not be a Member or a
resident of the State of Delaware.

 

(c) Any Manager position to be filled by reason of an increase
in the number of Managers or by any other reason shall be filled by the
Members. Any Manager may be removed by the Members at any time. Any Manager
may resign at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and shall
take effect at the time specified therein, or if no time is specified, at the
time of its receipt by the remaining Manager(s). The acceptance of a
resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective, unless expressly so
provided in the resignation. 

(d) The Board may act (i) through meetings and written consents
pursuant to _Section 8(e)_ and (ii) through any person or persons to whom
authority and duties have been delegated pursuant to _Section 8(f)_.

 

(e) Each Manager shall have one vote on all matters submitted to the
Board (whether the consideration of such matter is taken at a meeting, by
written consent or otherwise). The affirmative vote of the Managers holding a
majority of the votes of the Managers shall be the act of the Board. Meetings
of the Board shall be held at the principal office of the Company or at such
other place as may be determined by the Board. A majority of the Managers,
present in person or through their duly authorized attorneys-in-fact, shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Board. Business may be conducted
once a quorum is present. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held on such
dates and at such times as shall be determined by the Board. Special meetings
of the Board may be called by a majority of all of the Managers on at least
24 hours prior written notice to the other Managers, which

 



2  notice shall state the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is being
called. The actions taken by the Board at any meeting, however called and
noticed, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after
regular call and notice if (but not until), either before, at or after the
meeting, the Manager as to whom it was improperly held signs a written waiver
of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the
minutes thereof. The actions by the Board may be taken by vote of the Board at
a meeting of the Managers thereof or by written consent (without a meeting,
without notice and without a vote) so long as such consent is signed by at
least the minimum number of Managers that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting of the Board in which all Managers were present.
Prompt notice of the action so taken without a meeting shall be given to
those Managers who have not consented in writing. Each meeting of the Board
shall, at the request of any Manager, be held by conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all individuals
participating in the meeting can be heard.

(f) The Board may, from time to time, designate one or more persons
to be officers of the Company. No officer need be a resident of the State of
Delaware, a Member or a Manager. Any officers so designated shall have such
authority and perform such duties as the Board may, from time to time,
delegate to them. The Board may assign titles to particular officers. Unless
the Board otherwise decides, if the title is one commonly used for officers of
a business corporation, the assignment of such title shall constitute the
delegation to such officer of the authority and duties that are normally
associated with that office, subject to any specific delegation of authority
and duties made to such officer by the Board. Each officer shall hold office
until his successor shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his
death or until he shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner
hereinafter provided. Any number of offices may be held by the same
individual. Any officer may resign as such at any time. Such resignation shall
be made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if
no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the Board. The acceptance
of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective, unless expressly
so provided in the resignation. Any officer may be removed as such, either
with or without cause, by the Board whenever in its judgment the best
interests of the Company shall be served thereby. The initial officers of the
Company shall be as follows:

 

President and Chief Executive Officer \-- [ *** ]

 

Chief Financial Officer and Secretary  [ *** ]

 

Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer  [ *** ]

 

Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer  [ *** ]

 

(g) Each Manager of the Company may at any time and from time
to time engage in and own interests in other business ventures of any and
every type and description, independently or with others (including ones in
competition with the Company) with no obligation to offer to the Company the
right to participate therein.

9. _Member Meetings, etc._

 

(a) No Member, unless such Member is also a Manager, shall have any
right, power or duty, including the right to approve or vote on any matter,
except as expressly required by the Act or other applicable law or as
expressly provided for hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided by
this Agreement or as required by the Delaware Act, acts by the Members
holding a majority of the membership interests of the Company shall be the act
of the Members.

 

(b) The actions by the Members permitted hereunder may be taken at a
meeting called by the Board or by Members holding a majority of the membership
interests of the Company on at least twenty-four hours prior written notice
to the other Members entitled to vote, which notice shall state the purpose
or purposes for which such meeting is being called. The actions taken by the
Members

 



***Confidential Treatment Requested

  



3  entitled to vote or consent at any meeting (as opposed to by written
consent), however called and noticed, shall be as valid as though taken at a
meeting duly held after regular call and notice if (but not until), either
before, at or after the meeting, the Members entitled to vote or consent as to
whom it was improperly held signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to
the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. 

(c) The actions by the Members entitled to vote or consent may be
taken by vote of the Members entitled to vote or consent by written consent
(without a meeting, without notice, and without a vote) so long as such
consent is signed by the Members having not less than the minimum number of
membership interests that would be necessary to authorize or take such action
at a meeting at which all Members entitled to vote thereon were present and
voted. Prompt notice of the action so taken without a meeting shall be given
to those Members entitled to vote or consent who have not consented in
writing. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent of the Members
shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the Members at a meeting
thereof. A meeting of the Members may be held by conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all individuals
participating in the meeting can be heard.

 

10. _Indemnification_. 

 

(a) No officer or Manager shall be liable to any other
officer, Manager, the Company or to any Member for any loss suffered by the
Company or any Member unless such loss is caused by such persons willful
misconduct, violation of law or material breach of this Agreement. The
officers and Managers shall not be liable for errors in judgment or for any
acts or omissions that do not constitute willful misconduct, violation of law
or material breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that each Manager and
each officer shall discharge his duties hereunder in good faith, with the
care a corporate director or officer of like position would exercise under
similar circumstances, in the manner he, she or it reasonably believes to be
in the best interest of the Company. Any officer or Manager may consult with
counsel and accountants in respect of Company affairs, and provided such
person acts in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such counsel
or accountants, such person shall not be liable for any loss suffered by the
Company or any Member in reliance thereon.

(b) Subject to the limitations and conditions as provided in this
_Section 10_ , each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative
(hereinafter, a " _Proceeding_ "), or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any
inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a member, Manager or officer, or while a member,
Manager or officer is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited
liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall be,
indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
Act, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to
provide prior to such amendment) against judgments, penalties (including
excise and similar taxes and punitive damages), fines, settlements and
reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees actually incurred by
such person in connection with such Proceeding, and. Indemnification under
this _Section 10_ shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the

and shall vest immediately upon commencement of such persons status as a
member, Manager, officer, manager, director, partner, venturer, proprietor,
trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary, and no amendment,
modification or repeal of this _Section 10_ shall have the effect of limiting

 



4  or denying any such rights with respect to actions taken or Proceedings
arising prior to any amendment, modification or repeal. It is expressly
acknowledged that the indemnification provided in this _Section 10_ could
involve indemnification for negligence or under theories of strict liability.

 

(c) Reasonable expenses incurred by a person of the type entitled to
be indemnified under _Section 10(b)_ who was, is or is threatened to be made a
named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding shall be paid by the Company in
advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company; provided that, except as otherwise determined by the Board of
Managers, no expenses shall be paid by the Company pursuant to this _Section
10(c)_ in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding if the party
initiating the Proceeding is the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of
their respective securityholders acting by or in the right of the Company or
any its subsidiaries.

(d) The Company, by adoption of a resolution of the Board of
Managers, may indemnify and advance expenses to an employee or agent of the
Company to the same extent and subject to the same conditions under which it
may indemnify and advance expenses to persons who are not or were not
Managers or officers but who are or were serving at the request of the Company
as a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic
limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole-
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against him and incurred by him in such a capacity or
arising out of his status as such a person to the same extent that it may
indemnify and advance expenses to Managers and officers under this _Section
10_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding aby other provision of this _Section 10_ , the
Company shall pay or reimburse reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by a
Manager or officer in connection with his appearance as a witness or other
participation in a Proceeding at a time when he is not a named defendant or
respondent in the Proceeding.

(e) The right to indemnification and the advancement and payment of
expenses conferred in this _Section 10_ shall not be exclusive of any other
right which Manager, officer or other person indemnified pursuant to _Section
10(b)_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") may have or hereafter acquire under any law
(common or statutory), provision of the Companys certificate of formation,
this Agreement, vote of the Members or disinterested Managers or otherwise.

 

(f) The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, or cause
its subsidiaries to purchase and maintain insurance, at its or their expense,
to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a Manager, officer
or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as
a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee,
employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited
ability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship,
trust, employee benefits plan or other enterprise against any expense,
liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under this
_Section 10_.

 

(g) Each Member and its affiliates shall be considered express third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 10_ , and in the event that such Member
or any of its affiliates indemnifies any person who has a right to
indemnification from-the Company pursuant to this _Section 10_ , such Member
or affiliate thereof shall be entitled to subrogation against the Company.
The Company is primarily obligated to provide indemnity pursuant to this
_Section 10_ and waives any right to indemnification, subrogation, or
contribution against such Member or affiliate thereof.

 



5 (h) If this _Section 10_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated
on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall
nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Manager, officer or any other
person indemnified pursuant to this _Section 10_ as to costs, charges and
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,

 _Rules of Engagement for Accounting Firm_

 

If an Accounting Firm is engaged pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.01_ , the
parties will instruct the Accounting Firm to analyze and resolve the parties
dispute in accordance with the following guidelines (which guidelines and
relevant portions of this Agreement the Accounting Firm will be required to
review and commit to acting in accordance with):

 

 _Retainer and Fees_

The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
parties in inverse proportion to the relative success of the parties relating
to the disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm, with such
determination of relative success made by the Accounting Firm, or if the
Accounting Firm is unwilling to make such a determination, then such fees,
costs and expenses shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers).

 

To the extent the Accounting Firm requires a retainer or payment of expenses
prior to its final determination, the Purchaser and the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) will each pay 50% of any retainer and, during the
engagement, the Accounting Firm will bill 50% of the total charges to the
Purchaser and 50% of the total charges to the Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers). Such fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
adjusted, if necessary, pursuant to the first paragraph of this "Retainer and
Fees" section.

 

 _Parameters of Arbitration_

Except as permitted herein in order to clarify or understand any position or
argument made by a party in its written submission, the Accounting Firms
determination of the Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the
Transaction Expenses, and the amount of the Closing Date Cash and the
resulting Final Merger Consideration shall be based solely on written
presentations submitted by the Purchaser and the Representative which are in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures (including the definitions of
Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Net
Working Capital) set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an
independent review). The Accounting Firm shall consider only the disputed
matters that were included in the Objections Statement and the Accounting Firm
may not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
assigned by the Purchaser in the Preliminary Statement, on the one hand, or
the Representative in the Objections Statement, on the other hand, or less
than the smallest value for such item assigned by the Purchaser in the
Preliminary Statement, on the one hand, or the Representative in the
Objections Statement, on the other hand.

The timetable for these proceedings will be governed by the following
procedures:

 



     | ● |  |

Within fourteen (14) calendar days of retaining the Accounting Firm, each of
the Purchaser and the Representative shall submit to the Accounting Firm a
memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth their
respective 

---|---|---|---  positions of all unresolved disputed items in accordance with _Section_ _ _
_2.01_ of this Agreement (the " _Initial Report_ "). 

---|--- 
 



     | ● |  |

Within one (1) Business Day upon receipt of both the Purchasers and the
Representatives Initial Reports, the Accounting Firm will distribute a copy
of each Initial Report to the other party. 

---|---|---|--- 



     | ● |  |

Within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving the other partys Initial
Report from the Accounting Firm, each of the Purchaser and the Representative
may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Accounting Firm a memorandum
responding to the Initial Report submitted to the Accounting Firm by the other
party (the " _Rebuttal Report_ "). The Rebuttal Report is to be responsive
solely to the arguments raised, and information submitted, by the other party
in its Initial Report and no party may introduce new arguments or rely on new
information in the Rebuttal Report that was not part of such partys Initial
Report or which are not directly responsive to an argument raised by the other
partys Initial Report, except to the extent such new arguments or new
information are used in direct response to arguments raised and information
submitted by the other party in its Initial Report. 

---|---|---|--- 



     | ● |  |

Within one (1) Business Day upon receipt of the Rebuttal Reports from the
Purchaser and the Representative, the Accounting Firm will distribute a copy
of each Rebuttal Report to the other party. 

---|---|---|--- 



     | ● |  |

At any time before or within fifteen (15) calendar days after the submission
of the Initial Reports or any Rebuttal Reports by the Purchaser and the
Representative, the Accounting Firm may submit written questions to either
party following the procedures set forth below in the Section titled
"Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm." 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     | ● |  |

Upon receipt of the Rebuttal Report or notice waiving the right to file such
report from both the Purchaser and the Representative and receipt of all
responses to any written questions submitted by the Accounting Firm (and
responses thereto), the Accounting Firm will endeavor to issue a report
containing its findings within fifteen (15) calendar days after the later of
(i) receiving both the Purchasers and the Representatives Rebuttal Reports
or notice waiving the right to file such report, as applicable, or (ii) any
responses (if any) to any written questions submitted by the Accounting Firm
to either party following the procedures set forth below in the Section
titled "Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm." 

---|---|---|--- 



     | ● |  |

Unless requested by the Accounting Firm in writing pursuant to the terms of
the Section titled "Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm", neither
the Purchaser nor the Representative may present any additional information or
arguments to the Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     | ● |  |

The Accounting Firm shall render its decision without conducting a hearing. 

---|---|---|--- 
 

 _Submission of Questions by the Accounting Firm_

 

After receiving both Initial Reports and Rebuttal Reports, if any, the
Accounting Firm may submit written questions to the parties for
written responses or may direct requests for additional information,
calculations, or supporting documentation to the parties reasonably needed by
the Accounting Firm in order to clarify or understand any position or argument
made by a party in   its written submission, in which case the parties agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with such requests (including, without
limitation, by ensuring that the Accounting Firm is provided copies of all
relevant records of the business in accordance with _Article_ _ _ _1.10_ (b)
of this Agreement) in the manner and procedural timing described in this
paragraph. If any such questions are addressed to only one party, the
Accounting Firm shall submit the questions to that party, with a copy to the
other parties. Once received, the party (or parties) to whom the questions are
addressed shall have five (5) Business Days to answer the Accounting Firms
questions, and shall provide a copy of its written answers to the other party
at the time they are provided to the Accounting Firm. In response thereto, the
other party may, within five (5) Business Days, submit a response to such
answer(s) to the Accounting Firm and shall provide a copy of a response to the
other party at the time it is provided to the Accounting Firm. If any such
questions are addressed to both parties, each party shall have five (5)
Business Days from the date of receipt to respond to the Accounting Firm and
shall provide a copy of its written answers to the other parties at the time
they are provided to the Accounting Firm. In response thereto, each
party may, within five (5) Business Days, submit a response to the other
partys answer(s) to the Accounting Firm and shall provide a copy to the other
party at the time it is provided to the Accounting Firm.

 

 _Adjustment of Time Periods_

If the due date for any written submissions to be submitted to the Accounting
Firm falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the written submission shall
take place on the next Business Day.

 

 _Communication between the Accounting Firm and the Parties_

 

The parties agree not to engage in any ex parte communication with the
Accounting Firm.

 

The Accounting Firm will be required to include a representation in its
engagement letter that it has not discussed the substance of the disputed
matter with either party prior to its joint retention by the parties, and to
include a covenant in its engagement letter not to engage in ex parte
communications with either party throughout the course of the engagement.

 

The engagement letter will specifically require the Accounting Firm to review
_Article_ _ _ _1.10_ (b) of this Agreement, as well as any other provisions
of this Agreement deemed relevant by any of the Purchaser, the Seller or the
Accounting Firm.

_Nature of Review by Accounting Firm_

The Accounting Firm will make its determination in an objective, impartial
manner based on inquiry, investigation, and other procedures as it, in its
sole discretion may deem necessary, but in all cases consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and this _Exhibit_ _ _ _D_.

 

The Accounting Firm shall agree that between the time the Representative
delivered the Objections Statement to the Purchaser and the date hereof, the
Purchaser and the Representative may have exchanged certain proposals relating
to the disputed items that were intended solely for purposes of facilitating
settlement discussions and such proposals were confidential and were
provided solely on the condition and understanding that such proposals would
not be permitted to be disclosed in any court or arbitration hearing,
including with respect to the Accounting  Firms engagement in the dispute. The Accounting Firm will be instructed to
disregard any evidence of such settlement proposals and negotiations in its
consideration of the disputed matter.

_Confidentiality_

With respect to any information supplied in connection with the Accounting
Firms engagement and designated by either party as confidential, or which
either party should reasonably believe is confidential based on the subject
matter or the circumstances of its disclosure, the other party agrees to
protect such confidential information in a reasonable and appropriate manner,
and use confidential information only to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and for no other purpose. This will not apply to information which
is: (i) already publicly known prior to such disclosure (and through no breach
of the confidentiality obligations hereunder by the recipient thereof), or
(ii) disclosed pursuant to legal requirement or order. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no information (whether or not designated as confidential) may be
provided to the Accounting Firm without being made available to all parties in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and this _Exhibit_ _ _
_D_. The Accounting Firm shall not publicly disclose that it has been retained
to resolve any dispute relating to this Agreement or that it is involved in
the dispute, or any information relating to the dispute.

At the conclusion of the engagement contemplated hereby, confidential
information made available hereunder, including copies thereof, shall be
returned or destroyed upon request by the disclosing party.

_Other Procedural Matters_

 

Procedural matters for the conduct of the dispute resolution, other than as
specified herein, will be determined by the Accounting Firm in consultation
with the Purchaser and the Representative; _provided_ , however, that any such
procedural matters shall in all cases be consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and this _Exhibit_ _ _ _D_.

 

 _Conflicts of Interest_

Except in connection with the dispute being resolved with respect to this

reasonable and documented expense (including, but without limitation,
reasonable and documented attorneys fees, costs and disbursements) that the

Important information about opening a new account at Citi Private Bank:

 



To help the United States Government fight terrorism and money laundering,
Federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record
information that identifies each individual, business or entity that opens an
account or establishes a relationship. What this means for you:

 

For individuals  when you open an account or establish a relationship, we
will ask for your:

 

¡ name,

 

¡ date of birth,

 

¡ residential street address, and

 

¡ identification number, such as a social security number, taxpayer
identification number, national identification number or passport number.

For businesses and other entities, such as corporations, trusts, etc.  when
you open an account or establish a relationship, we will ask for your:

¡ official name,

 

¡ principal place of business or local business street address, and

¡ taxpayer identification number or other registration number.

For individuals, we may also ask to see (and retain a copy of) your drivers
license, passport or other identifying documents that will help us identify
you. For businesses or entities, we may also ask for a copy of your formation
documents or other related documentation. If we have difficulty verifying an
accountholders identity, we may not be able to open an account or establish
a relationship, or we may have to block or close the account.

Thank you for your cooperation.
