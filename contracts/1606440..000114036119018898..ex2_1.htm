previously held by such shareholder, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,

Reliant shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise
be entitled to a fraction of a share of Reliant Common  Stock (after
aggregating and taking into account all Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) cash, without interest, in an amount (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (a) the fractional share
interest  (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)

withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into and canceled in exchange for,
or represent a right to receive, any portion of the Merger Consideration
hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as
are  afforded to such holder by the TBCA. Reliant shall be entitled to retain
any Merger Consideration not paid on account of Dissenting Shares, and the
shareholders of the Company shall not be entitled to any portion of such

such event, whichever occurs later, the shares of Company Common Stock held by

by share basis, the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable or
issuable in respect thereof in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement.

changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend,  stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, an equitable and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio. For the avoidance of doubt, neither (i) the grant or award of,
the lapse of restrictions with  respect to, or the issuance or withholding of
shares of Reliant Common Stock upon the exercise or settlement of (including
the satisfaction of Tax withholding obligations associated with) Reliant
Equity Awards nor the grant or award of, the lapse of  restrictions with

Section 3.8 _Company Equity Awards._

 

 

(a) Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether then vested or unvested, shall, at the Effective Time and without any
action on the part  of the holder thereof, become fully vested and be
automatically canceled, and the holder thereof shall have the right to receive
from Reliant a cash payment in respect of such canceled Company Option in an
amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent  (the "Option Consideration"),
equal to the product of (i) $30.00 (the "Option Price") minus the    per
share exercise price of such Company Option multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, to the extent
not  previously exercised. At and after the Effective Time, each such
canceled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder
thereof and shall instead only entitle such holder to the payment of the
Option Consideration, if any,  payable in respect thereof, without interest.
In the event the per share exercise price of a Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Option Price, such Company Option shall be canceled for no
consideration and shall have no further force or  effect. In the event the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to outstanding Company
Options change(s) during the period from the date of this Agreement until
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Option Price shall be equitably 
and proportionally adjusted.

 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, solely by virtue and as a result of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company RSU Award
and Company  Restricted Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall fully vest and shall be canceled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ (payable in  accordance with this _Article III_ and subject to
any required Tax withholding), treating the shares of Company Common Stock
subject to or underlying such Company RSU Award or Company Restricted Share
Award in the same manner as all other  shares of Company Common Stock for
such purposes.

applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise  deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such
amounts as Reliant is required under the Code or any other applicable Law to
deduct and withhold. Any amounts so  deducted and withheld shall be timely
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity and, to the extent so
remitted, shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

in accordance with GAAP, to  cover all unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for periods ending on or prior to the date(s) of the Interim
Company Financials, and all such accruals and reserves for Taxes, as adjusted
for operations and transactions and the passage of  time for periods ending

through the Closing Date. No claim has ever been made against the First
Advantage Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries by a taxing
authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or the Bank or their respective
Subsidiaries do not file Tax  Returns that the Company or the Bank or any of
their respective Subsidiaries are or may be subject to taxation in that
jurisdiction. No outstanding agreement, arrangement, extension, or waiver of
or with respect to the limitation period applicable to  any First Advantage

respect of the operations of, the First Advantage Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries  have been paid to the proper taxing authorities,

collect in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee,
director, independent contractor, shareholder, nonresident, creditor,  or
other third party (including amounts paid or owing by or to the First
Advantage Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries and any such Taxes
due as a result of a plan intended to be a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" under Section  409A(d)(1) of the Code that has not been operated in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and associated guidance)
have been duly withheld or collected and have been paid, to the extent

benefits payable in the ordinary course of business the payment of which is
not delinquent, there are no unpaid wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, or
other amounts owed  to any employee or former employee of the Company or the
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(iii) To the Knowledge of the Company, no director, officer, employee, or
independent contractor of or to the Company or the Bank or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is a  party to or otherwise bound by any Contract,
including without limitation any confidentiality, non-competition, non-
solicitation, or proprietary rights agreement, that has adversely affected or
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the  ability of the Company
or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct its business as
currently conducted or the ability of such Person to perform and carry out
such Person's duties or responsibilities.

(iv) Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries, has classified any Person as an "independent contractor" or any

independent  contractors, or consultants of the Company or the Bank or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or any spouse, dependent, or beneficiary of any
such Person, or to or under which the Company or the Bank has or may have any
Liability, contingent or  otherwise (herein referred to collectively as the
"First Advantage Benefit Plans"), including any and all plans or policies
offered to employees of the Company or the Bank, or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries, with respect to which the Company or the Bank or an ERISA
Affiliate has claimed or is claiming the safe harbor for "voluntary plans"
under ERISA for group and group-type insurance arrangements ("First Advantage
Voluntary Plans"). The First Advantage Parties have previously delivered or
made available to Reliant true, correct, and complete copies of all plans,
contracts, agreements, arrangements, and other  documents required to be set
forth on _Schedule 4.2(r)(i)_ of the First Advantage Disclosure Memorandum,
along with, where applicable: (A) all current investment management contracts,
custodial  agreements, administrative service agreements, and insurance and
annuity contracts; (B) the current summary plan description and summary of
material modifications and each current Summary of Benefits and Coverage; (C)
the most recently filed annual  reports (Form 5500 with all corresponding
schedules and financial statements); (D) the most recent IRS determination,

Section 4975 of the Code, or  "reportable events" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA; and (H) copies of the most recently filed IRS Forms
1094 and 1095. There has been no announcement or commitment by the Company or
the Bank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to  create any additional
First Advantage Benefit Plan, to amend any First Advantage Benefit Plan
(except for amendments required by applicable Law which do not materially
increase the cost of such First Advantage Benefit Plan), or to terminate any
First  Advantage Benefit Plan.

 


 

 

 

32  

(ii) Other than routine claims for benefits thereunder customary in nature and
amount, there is no pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claim, litigation,  action, administrative action, suit, audit, arbitration,
mediation, or other proceeding (legal, administrative, or otherwise) relating
to any First Advantage Benefit Plan. All of the First Advantage Benefit Plans
have been established, maintained and  administered in compliance, in all
material respects, with all applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and
other applicable Laws, and the terms and provisions of all documents,
contracts, or agreements establishing the First Advantage Benefit  Plans or
pursuant to which they are maintained or administered. There are no existing
circumstances and no event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any First Advantage Benefit Plan that
is  likely to result in, or has already resulted in, the imposition of any
material Taxes or material liability upon the Company or the Bank or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. No audit of any First Advantage Benefit Plan by
the IRS or the United  States Department of Labor is ongoing or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or was ongoing, threatened, or closed at
any time during the past five years. No "prohibited transaction" (as defined
in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the  Code) has occurred with
respect to any First Advantage Benefit Plan that is likely to result in, or
has already resulted in, the imposition of any material penalties or material
Taxes upon the Company or the Bank or any of their respective  Subsidiaries
under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

 

 

(iii) No Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has
been, or is expected by the First  Advantage Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries to be, incurred with respect to any First Advantage Benefit Plan
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "First Advantage Pension Plan"),  or
with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a) of
ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by the Company or the Bank or any
ERISA Affiliate. No First Advantage Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as  defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as
of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the
date of this Agreement; the fair market value of the assets of each First
Advantage Pension Plan exceeds the  present value of the "benefit
liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such First
Advantage Pension Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior
to the date of this Agreement, calculated on the basis of the  actuarial
assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such First
Advantage Pension Plan as of the date of this Agreement; and no notice of a
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the
reporting requirement  has not been waived has been required to be filed for
any First Advantage Pension Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date
of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries, has provided or is  required to provide security to
any First Advantage Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. Neither the Company nor
the Bank, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or any ERISA  Affiliate,
has contributed to or is or has been obligated to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 


 

 

 

33  

(iv) Each First Advantage Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be
qualified under Section  401(a) of the Code (a "First Advantage Qualified
Plan") has received a current favorable determination letter from the IRS (or,
in the case of an IRS pre-approved plan, the pre-approved plan  has a current
IRS opinion or advisory letter upon which the First Advantage Parties are
entitled to rely under applicable IRS guidance), and to the Knowledge of the
Company there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected
to  result in the revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Each
First Advantage Qualified Plan, if any, that is an "employee stock ownership
plan" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) has satisfied all of the
applicable  requirements of Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder in all material respects, and any assets of any such
First Advantage Qualified Plan that, as of the end of the most recent plan
year, are not allocated to  participants' individual accounts are pledged as
security for, and may be applied to satisfy, any securities acquisition
indebtedness.

 

 

(v) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(r)(v)_ of the First Advantage
Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor the Bank,  nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries, has any obligations for post-retirement or post-
employment benefits under any First Advantage Benefit Plan that cannot be
amended or terminated upon 60 days or less notice without incurring any
Liability  thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or similar state Laws, the cost of which is
borne by the insured individuals.

 

 

(vi) All contributions and payments required to be made with respect to any
First Advantage Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or
other contractual  undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect
to insurance policies funding any First Advantage Benefit Plan, have been
timely made or paid in full by the applicable due date, with extensions, or to
the extent not required to be made or  paid on or before the date hereof,
have been fully reflected or reserved against in the Interim Company
Financials to the extent required by GAAP or regulatory accounting
requirements. Each First Advantage Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare 
benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (A) is funded through an
insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (B) is unfunded. Any unfunded First
Advantage Benefit Plan pays  benefits solely from the general assets of the
Company or the Bank, or their applicable Subsidiary, for which arrangement the
establishment of a trust under ERISA is not required.

 

 

(vii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(r)(vii)_ of the First Advantage
Disclosure Memorandum, all required reports, notices,  disclosures, and
descriptions (including without limitation Form 5500 annual reports and
required attachments, Forms 1099-R, Forms 1094 and 1095, summary annual
reports, Forms PBGC-1, and summary plan descriptions) have been timely filed
or  distributed in accordance with applicable Law with respect to each First
Advantage Benefit Plan. All required Tax filings with respect to each First
Advantage Benefit Plan have been made, and any Taxes due in connection with
such filings have been  paid.

 


 

 

 

34  

(viii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(r)(viii)_ of the First Advantage
Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor the  Bank, nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries, is a party to or bound by any Contract (including
without limitation any severance, change of control, salary continuation, or
employment agreement) under or pursuant to which (A) any current or former 
director, officer, employee, independent contractor, or consultant of the
Company or the Bank, or of any of their respective Subsidiaries, is or will be
entitled to severance pay or change of control or other benefits, or any
increase in severance  pay or other benefits (whether upon termination of
employment or termination of such Contract after the date hereof or
otherwise), (B) the timing of any payment or vesting will be accelerated, any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or  otherwise) of compensation or
benefits will be triggered, the amount payable thereunder will be increased,
or any withdrawal liability or any other material obligation will be
triggered, or (C) there is or will be payable any "excess parachute  payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, the imposition of any Tax
under Section 409A of the Code, or the forgiveness of any indebtedness, in
each case as a result or consequence of the execution or delivery of this
Agreement,  shareholder approval of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the consummation of the transactions, including the
Mergers or the Bank Merger, contemplated hereby, either alone or in connection
with any other event.

 

 

(ix) Each First Advantage Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in
documentary compliance with  Section 409A of the Code and has been
administered in all material respects (A) in good faith compliance with
Section 409A of the Code during the period beginning October 1, 2004, through
December 31, 2008, and (B) in compliance with Section 409A of  the Code since
January 1, 2009.

 

 

(x) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(r)(x)_ , no Person is entitled to
receive any additional payment (including without  limitation any Tax gross-
up or similar payment) from the Company or the Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of any excise Taxes under Section
4999 of the Code or any Taxes required or imposed by Section 409A of  the
Code.

 

 

(xi) To the Knowledge of the Company, all of the First Advantage Benefit Plans
are nondiscriminatory with respect to eligibility and benefits to the extent
required under  applicable provisions of the Code and other applicable Laws.
To the extent required by applicable Law, all of the First Advantage Benefit
Plans have been approved by the shareholders of the Company or the Bank, as
applicable, or the shareholders of  corporations the Company or the Bank has
acquired.

 

 

(xii) To the Knowledge of the Company, all First Advantage Voluntary Plans
satisfy the regulatory safe-harbor requirements provided by ERISA in order for
such First Advantage  Voluntary Plans to be considered not to be established,
sponsored, or maintained by the Company or the Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and not to constitute an "employee benefit plan" subject to
ERISA.

 


 

 

 

35  

 

(s) Real and Personal Property.

 

  
   

(i) Set forth on _Schedule 4.2(s)(i)_ of the First Advantage Disclosure
Memorandum is a true, correct, and complete list (by  street address) as of
the date of this Agreement of all real property owned by the Company or the
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including without limitation
property carried on the books of the Bank as "Other Real Estate Owned" (the
"Owned Real Property"), and all real property leased by the Company or the
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real  Property" and
together with the Owned Real Property, collectively, the "First Advantage
Properties"). Except for the First Advantage Properties, as of the date of
this Agreement,  neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries holds any interest (fee, leasehold, or otherwise) in any real
property, other than interests held as a creditor in real property securing
Bank Loans. The Company and the Bank  and their respective Subsidiaries have
good and marketable title to all of the Owned Real Property (including any
property acquired in a judicial foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure or similar transfer), in each case  free and clear of any
and all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. None of the Owned Real Property is
leased by the Company or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
There are no material unpaid bills or claims for work performed on or at  the
First Advantage Properties other than bills for work that has been performed
but which are not yet due and payable. Each lease pursuant to which the
Company or the Bank or their respective Subsidiaries lease the Leased Real
Property is valid,  binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect, and
neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their respective Subsidiaries,
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party to any such lease, is in
breach or default under or in violation  of any provision of any such lease.
The First Advantage Parties have previously delivered or made available to
Reliant a true, correct, and complete copy of each such lease, including all
amendments thereto. Each of the First Advantage Properties is  in good
condition (normal wear and tear excepted), conforms with all applicable
ordinances, regulations, and zoning and other Laws, and is reasonably
considered by the First Advantage Parties to be adequate for the current
business of the First  Advantage Parties and their respective Subsidiaries.
To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the buildings, structures, or other
improvements located on any of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real
Property encroaches upon or over any adjoining  parcel of real estate or any
easement or right-of-way and none of the buildings, structures, or other
improvements located on any parcel adjoining any of the Owned Real Property
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Leased Real Property encroaches 
upon or over any portion of the First Advantage Properties.

 

 

(ii) The First Advantage Parties and their respective Subsidiaries are
entitled to and have exclusive possession of the Leased Real Property. The
First Advantage Properties  are not subject to any legally binding lease,
tenancy, or license or any legally binding agreement to grant any such lease,
tenancy, or license that materially interferes with the First Advantage
Parties' or their respective Subsidiaries' use of the  First Advantage
Properties. There is no Person in possession or occupation of, or who has any
current right to possession or occupation of, the First Advantage Properties
other than the First Advantage Parties and their respective Subsidiaries.
There  are no easements of any kind on, in respect of, or affecting the First
Advantage Properties that materially and adversely affect the rights of the
First Advantage Parties and their respective Subsidiaries to use the First
Advantage Properties for the  conduct of their business.

 

 

(iii) None of the First Advantage Properties, nor any building, structure,
fixture, or improvement thereon, is the subject of, or affected by,  any
condemnation, taking, eminent domain, or inverse condemnation proceeding
currently instituted or pending, and the Company has no Knowledge that any of
the First Advantage Properties, or any such building, structure, fixture, or
improvement,  will or may be the subject of, or affected by, any such
proceeding. There are no special, general, or other assessment proceedings
affecting the First Advantage Properties which, if as a result of which a
special, general, or other assessment were  imposed, would materially
increase the cost of using and operating the First Advantage Properties as
currently used and operated by the First Advantage Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries.

 

 

(iv) None of the First Advantage Properties are located in any special flood
hazard area or zone on any official flood hazard map published by  the United
States Federal Emergency Management Agency or in any wetland area as
designated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, or any applicable state or local agency. The
First Advantage  Properties are appropriately zoned for each of the purposes
for which they are being used by the First Advantage Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

 

36  

(v) Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries, has experienced any material restriction in access to or from 
public roads or any material restriction in access to any utilities, including
without limitation water, sewer, drainage, gas, electric, telephone, cable,
and internet, used by the Company or the Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in the  operation of their business as presently conducted;
there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
governmental action that could prohibit or materially interfere with such
access; and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact  or condition exists
which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, may result
in the termination of or the material reduction or impairment of such access.
All existing utilities provided at the First Advantage Properties are 
adequate in all material respects for the First Advantage Parties' and their
respective Subsidiaries' existing use and operation of the First Advantage
Properties.

 

 

(vi) The Company and the Bank and their respective Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and
clear of any and  all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. Each lease pursuant
to which the Company or the Bank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
leases personal property is valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and
effect, and neither the Company nor  the Bank, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries, nor any other party to any such lease, is in default under or in
breach or violation of any provision of any such lease. The personal property
owned or leased by the Company and the Bank and their  respective
Subsidiaries is in good condition, normal wear and tear excepted, and is
sufficient for the carrying on of the business of the Company and the Bank and
their respective Subsidiaries in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice.

(i) Each of the First Advantage Properties is, and has been during the period
of the Company's or the Bank's or their respective Subsidiaries' ownership or
operation  thereof, in compliance with all Environmental Laws, and to the
Knowledge of the Company each of the First Advantage Loan Properties is, and
has been during the period of the Company's or the Bank's or their respective
Subsidiaries' possession of a  security interest therein, in compliance with
all Environmental Laws. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or

Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no suit, claim,
action, demand, executive or  administrative order, directive, investigation,

to alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with or Liability
under any Environmental Law or (B) relating to the presence of or release into
the environment of any Hazardous Substance, whether or not occurring at or

executive or administrative order, directive, or request for information from
any Governmental  Entity or other third party indicating that it is or may be
in violation of or have any Liability under any Environmental Law.

 

 

(ii) There are no underground storage tanks at or on any of the First
Advantage Properties, any other property operated by the Company or the Bank
or any of their respective  Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor the Bank

their respective Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Bank Loans") (A) were made

of such as are afforded by usury or truth in lending Laws, subject, however,
to the Enforceability Exceptions. The notes or other evidences of

Disclosure Memorandum, none of the Contracts pursuant  to which the Company

the part of the Company or the Bank or any of their respective  Subsidiaries
to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of a payment
default by the obligors on such Loans other than in the case where there has
been a material breach of a representation or warranty by the Company or the
Bank.

 

 

(v) Set forth on _Schedule 4.2(w)(v)_ of the First Advantage Disclosure
Memorandum is a true, correct, and complete list of all  Loans, as of the
date of this Agreement, by the Company or the Bank or any of their respective

months of, or has asserted against the Company or the Bank or any  of their
respective Subsidiaries, any "lender liability" or similar claim; (B) all
Loans of the Company and the Bank and their respective Subsidiaries (1) that
are contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest,  (2) that are on non-accrual status, (3) that are classified as
"special mention," "substandard," "doubtful," "loss," or words of similar
import, (4) where the interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the
maturity dates have been extended  subsequent to the origination of the Loans
due to concerns regarding the borrowers' ability to pay in accordance with the
Loans' original terms, or (5) where a specific reserve allocation exists in
connection therewith; and (C) all assets classified  by the Company or the
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries as "Other Real Estate Owned" or

respective Subsidiaries are owned by the First Advantage Parties or their
respective Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens,  except for Liens on
Loans granted to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta or to the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Cincinnati to secure advances therefrom. No claims of defense as
to the enforcement of any Loan held by the Company or the Bank or their 
respective Subsidiaries have been asserted in writing against the First
Advantage Parties or their respective Subsidiaries for which there is a
reasonable possibility of an adverse determination. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.2(w)(viii)_ , none of the Loans held by the Company or the Bank or
their respective Subsidiaries are presently serviced by third parties, and
there is no obligation which could result in any such Loan becoming subject 
to any third-party servicing.

 

 

(ix) Neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
is now or has been since January 1, 2017, subject to any material fine,
suspension, or  settlement or other administrative agreement or sanction by,
or any reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any Governmental Entity
relating to the origination, sale, or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.

 

 

(x) Material Interests of Certain Persons. Except for deposit and loan
relationships entered into in the ordinary course of business  in compliance
with applicable Law and except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(x)_ of the First
Advantage Disclosure Memorandum, no current or former officer or director of
the Company or the Bank or any of  their respective Subsidiaries, or any
family member or Affiliate of any such Person, has any material direct or
indirect interest in any Contract or property, real or personal, tangible or
intangible, of, used in or pertaining to the business of, or  owned or leased
by the Company or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

 

(y) Insurance. Set forth on _Schedule 4.2(y)_ of the First Advantage
Disclosure  Memorandum is a true, correct, and complete list of all policies
of insurance currently held or maintained by or providing coverage for the
Company or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, including without
limitation bank-owned life  insurance (collectively, the "First Advantage
Insurance Policies"), including for each such First Advantage Insurance Policy
(i) the name of the insurer, (ii) the named insured(s), (iii) the  nature of
the coverage, (iv) the policy limits (on a per occurrence and aggregate
basis), (v) the annual premiums, and (vi) the expiration date. The Company and
the Bank and their respective Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers
against  such risks and in such amounts as the management of the Company
reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with industry
practices. All of the First Advantage Insurance Policies are in full force and
effect, neither the Company nor Bank  nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries is in default thereunder, and no event has occurred which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or permit a
termination, modification, or acceleration under any of the First  Advantage
Insurance Policies. All premiums due and payable with respect to the First
Advantage Insurance Policies have been timely and fully paid (to the extent
due and payable), and all claims thereunder have been filed in a timely
fashion. To the  Knowledge of the Company, there is no material claim for
coverage by the Company or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries
pending under any of the First Advantage Insurance Policies as to which
coverage has been denied or disputed. Neither  the Company nor the Bank nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries has received written notice of any
termination of (actual or threatened), material premium increase with respect
to, or material alteration of coverage under any of the First Advantage 
Insurance Policies.

 


 

 

 

40  

(z) Investment Securities; Derivatives. The First Advantage Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries have good title to all  securities and commodities
owned by them (except those sold under repurchase agreements), free and clear
of any Liens, except to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged
in the ordinary course of business to secure obligations of the  First
Advantage Parties and their respective Subsidiaries. Such securities and
commodities are valued on the books of the First Advantage Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP. The First Advantage Parties
and their  respective Subsidiaries employ investment, securities,
commodities, risk management, and other similar policies, practices, and
procedures that are prudent and reasonable in the context of their respective
businesses, and prior to the date of this  Agreement, the First Advantage
Parties have made available to Reliant true, correct, and complete copies of
or the material terms of such policies, practices, and procedures. Except for
restrictions that exist for securities that are classified as  "held to
maturity," none of the investment securities held by the Company or the Bank
or any of their respective Subsidiaries are subject to any restriction
(whether contractual, statutory, or otherwise) that could materially impair
the ability of  the entity holding such investment securities freely to
dispose of such investment securities at any time. Neither the Company nor the
Bank nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party to or has agreed to
enter into any exchange-traded or  over-the-counter equity, interest rate,
foreign exchange, or other swap, forward, future, option, cap, floor, or
collar, or any other Contract that is a derivative contract (including various
combinations thereof), or owns securities that (i) are  referred to
generically as "structured notes," "high risk mortgage derivatives," "capped
floating rate notes," or "capped floating rate mortgage derivatives" or (ii)
are likely to have changes in value as a result of interest or exchange rate
changes  that materially exceed normal changes in value attributable to
interest or exchange rate changes.

 

 

(aa) Securities Transactions. All offers and sales of securities by the
Company or the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries  were at all
relevant times exempt from, or complied with, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws. Neither the First Advantage 
Parties nor their respective Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any director, officer, or employee of the Company or the Bank or
their respective Subsidiaries, any Person related to any such director,
officer, or employee by blood,  marriage, or adoption and residing in the
same household, or any Person who has been knowingly provided material
nonpublic information by any one or more of any of the foregoing Persons, has
purchased or sold, or caused to be purchased or sold, any  shares of Company
Stock or Bank Stock (or other securities issued by the Company or the Bank or
their respective Subsidiaries) in violation of any applicable provision of
federal or state securities Laws.

 

 

(bb) Transactions with Affiliates. All "covered transactions" between the Bank
and any "affiliate" within the meaning of Section 23A  and Section 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto have been
in compliance in all material respects with such provisions of Law.

 


 

 

 

41  

(cc) Fiduciary Accounts. The Company and the Bank and their respective
Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts, if any,  for which they
serve or act as a fiduciary, including without limitation accounts for which
they serve as trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian,
conservator, or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of all
governing  documents and applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor the Bank
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any of the Company's or the Bank's or any of their respective
Subsidiaries' directors, officers, or  employees, have committed any breach
of trust with respect to any fiduciary account, and the records for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account.

 

 

(dd) Tax Treatment of Mergers. The Company has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent  the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

(ee) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC, and Customer Information Security. The
Bank received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better  during its most recent
examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. The Company does not
have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected
to cause the Bank (i) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance  in
any material respect with the CRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
or to be assigned a rating for CRA purposes by federal banking regulators of
lower than "Satisfactory"; (ii) to be deemed to be operating in violation, in
any material  respect, of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the USA
PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the
United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control,
or any other applicable anti-money  laundering Law; or (iii) to be deemed not
to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with applicable
privacy of customer or consumer information requirements contained in any
federal or state privacy Laws, including without limitation  in Title V of
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the information security
policies or program adopted by the Bank. To the  Knowledge of the Company, no
non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an
unauthorized third party in a manner which would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause the Bank to undertake any remedial action. The board of 
directors of the Bank has adopted, and the Bank has implemented, an anti-money
laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA
PATRIOT Act, and such  anti-money laundering program meets the requirements
of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and the
Bank has complied in all material respects with any requirements to file
reports and other necessary documents as  required by the USA PATRIOT Act and
the regulations thereunder.

(ff) Internal Controls. The records, systems, controls, data, and information
of the First Advantage Parties and their respective  Subsidiaries are
recorded, stored, maintained, and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical, or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the First
Advantage  Parties and their respective Subsidiaries (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect  on the First Advantage Parties' or their respective
Subsidiaries' system of internal accounting controls. The Company and the Bank
and their respective Subsidiaries have devised and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting  sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are  executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
and (iii)  access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorizations. There are no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which  could adversely affect the ability of the Company
or the Bank or their respective Subsidiaries to record, process, summarize,
and report financial information. Since January 1, 2017, (i) neither the First
Advantage Parties nor any of their  respective Subsidiaries, nor any
director, officer, or employee of the First Advantage Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, has received any complaint, allegation, assertion, or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting  or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies, or methods of the First Advantage
Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or internal accounting
controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion, or claim that the
First Advantage  Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries have engaged
in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the First Advantage Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or any other Person (other than  federal or state bank
regulatory agencies in the ordinary course of routine regulatory examinations
and visitations), whether or not employed by the First Advantage Parties or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a  material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty, or violation of
banking or other Laws by the First Advantage Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or any of the officers, directors, or employees of
the First Advantage  Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the
board of directors of the Company or the Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (or any committee thereof) or, to the Knowledge of the First
Advantage Parties, to any director or  executive officer of the Company or
the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries. There has occurred no fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a role in the First Advantage Parties' internal  controls over financial
reporting.

 

 

(gg) Regulatory Capital. The Company and the Bank are "well-capitalized" as
such term is defined in 12 C.F.R. 225.2 and 12 C.F.R.  325.103, respectively.

 

 

(hh) State Antitakeover Laws. The Company and the Bank and their respective
Subsidiaries have taken (through their respective  boards of directors or
otherwise) all action required to render inapplicable to this Agreement and
the Bank Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
any otherwise applicable state antitakeover Laws, including without 
limitation any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "takeover," or
"interested shareholder" Law (collectively, "Takeover Laws").

 

 

(ii) No Further Representations.

 

 

(i) Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
_Article IV_ (including the related portions of the First Advantage
Disclosure  Memorandum), the Company does not make any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or the Bank or their
respective Subsidiaries or the respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, or conditions  (financial or otherwise) of the Company or the
Bank or their respective Subsidiaries, and the Company hereby disclaims any
such other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, except for the representations and warranties made by
the Company in this _Article IV_ (including the related portions of the First
Advantage Disclosure Memorandum), the Company does not make any representation
or  warranty to the Reliant Parties with respect to (i) any financial
projection, forecast, estimate, budget, or prospective information relating to
the First Advantage Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the
respective businesses of  the First Advantage Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries or (ii) any oral or written information presented, delivered, or
made available to Reliant or Reliant Bank in the course of their due diligence
investigation of the First Advantage  Parties or their negotiation of this
Agreement or otherwise in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

43  

(ii) The Company acknowledges and agrees that (A) except as expressly set
forth in _Article V_ (including the related portions of the Reliant
Disclosure  Memorandum), neither Reliant nor any other Person makes or has
made any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Reliant
or Reliant Bank or their respective Subsidiaries or the respective businesses,
operations, assets,  liabilities, or conditions (financial or otherwise) of
the Reliant Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and (B) any such other
representations or warranties are specifically disclaimed and the Company did
not rely on any representation or  warranty not contained in _Article V_
(including the related portions of the Reliant Disclosure Memorandum) when
making their decision to enter into this Agreement and will not rely on any
such representation or warranty in deciding to  consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant. The
outstanding capital stock or other outstanding equity or ownership interests

be made with respect thereto) that they have been required to file or 
furnish since January 1, 2017, with or to the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the
TDFI, or any other Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments
due and payable in connection therewith, except where the  failure to file or
furnish the same or pay such fees and assessments would not be reasonably
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Reliant. As of their respective dates, such reports,  notices,
applications, schedules, registration and proxy statements, and other filings,
documents, and instruments were complete and accurate in all material respects
and complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws.

registration statements, definitive proxy  statements, exhibits, and other
filings and materials that Reliant has been required to file under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, since January 1, 2017 (collectively, the "Reliant Securities
Filings"). As of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
filing), none of  the Reliant Securities Filings contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they  were made, not misleading. As of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
filing), the Reliant Securities Filings complied in  all material respects
with applicable requirements of the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, as

applicable to such Reliant Securities Filings.

 

 

 

47  

(i) Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of Reliant and
its Subsidiaries included in the Reliant  Securities Filings (including the
related notes, where applicable) (the "Reliant Financial Statements") fairly
present in all material respects the financial position, results of 
operations, and cash flows of Reliant and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates or for the respective fiscal periods therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount  which will not be material individually or in
the aggregate). Each of the Reliant Financial Statements (including the
related notes, where applicable) complies in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the  published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and each of such Reliant
Financial Statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been
prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied  during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in
such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Reliant and
its Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2017, been, and are being, maintained
in all material respects  in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable
legal and accounting requirements. Since January 1, 2017, no independent
public accounting firm of Reliant has resigned (or informed Reliant that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as  independent public accountants of
Reliant as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Reliant on
a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.

Reliant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter  ended June

disclosed in the Second Quarter 10-Q, (iii) Liabilities incurred since June

including those arising under that certain Agreement and Plan of  Merger,
dated September 16, 2019, by and among Reliant, TCBH, and CBT (the "TCBH
Agreement"), and (v) Liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions  contemplated hereby.

 

 

(k) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2018, there has
been no effect, circumstance, occurrence, event,  development, or change
that, individually or taken together with all other effects, circumstances,
occurrences, events, developments, and changes, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant.

 

 

(l) Litigation. There are no suits, actions, claims, investigations, or legal,
administrative, arbitration, or other  proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Reliant, threatened against or affecting Reliant or Reliant Bank
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, any current or former director,
officer, or employee of Reliant or Reliant Bank or any of their  respective
Subsidiaries in his or her capacity as such, any Reliant Benefit Plan (as
defined below), or any property, asset, right, or interest of Reliant or
Reliant Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, which, individually or
in the  aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Reliant, and, to the Knowledge of Reliant, there
are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any such suit, action,  claim, investigation, or legal, administrative,
arbitration, or other proceeding. Neither Reliant nor Reliant Bank nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, nor any of the properties or assets of Reliant
or Reliant Bank or any of their respective  Subsidiaries, is a party or
subject to or bound by any judgment, decree, injunction, order, or ruling of
any Governmental Entity (other than such as are applicable to banks or bank
holding companies generally) that, individually or in the  aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant.

 

 

 

48  

(m) Regulatory Actions. Since January 1, 2017, neither Reliant nor Reliant
Bank, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, has  been a party to or
subject to any cease and desist order, prompt corrective action directive,
written agreement, or memorandum of understanding issued by or with, or any
commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or has been subject to any 
action, proceeding, order, or directive by, any Governmental Entity, or has
adopted any board resolutions at the request of any Governmental Entity, or
has been advised by any Governmental Entity that such Governmental Entity is
contemplating  issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness
of issuing or requesting) any such action, proceeding, order, directive, cease
and desist order, prompt corrective action directive, written agreement,
memorandum of understanding,  commitment letter, board resolutions, or
similar undertaking. To the Knowledge of Reliant, there are no facts or
circumstances which would reasonably be expected to result in any Governmental
Entity issuing or requesting any such action,  proceeding, order, directive,
cease and desist order, prompt corrective action directive, written agreement,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, board resolutions, or similar
undertaking. There are no material unresolved violations,  criticisms, or
exceptions noted by any Governmental Entity in or with respect to any report
or statement relating to any examination or inspection of Reliant or Reliant
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2017, there 
have been no material formal or informal inquires by (other than in the
ordinary course of routine regulatory examinations and visitations), or
material disagreements or disputes with, any Governmental Entity with respect
to the business,  operations, policies, or procedures of Reliant or Reliant
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 

 

(n) Compliance with Laws; Deposit Insurance.

 

 

(i) Reliant and Reliant Bank and their respective Subsidiaries have at all
times since January 1, 2017, complied with, and are currently in compliance
with, in each case  in all material respects, all applicable Laws, including
without limitation Section 23A and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and
the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; the Equal Credit Opportunity

Laws, and Laws relating to discriminatory lending, financing, leasing,  or
business practices or the origination, sale, or servicing of mortgage loans,
except where noncompliance with such applicable Laws would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on  Reliant. Except in each case as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant, Reliant
and Reliant Bank and their respective Subsidiaries have, and have at all times
had, all permits, licenses,  franchises, certificates of authority, orders,
authorizations, and approvals, and have made all filings, applications, and
registrations with all Governmental Entities, that are required in order to
permit them to own, lease, and operate their  properties and assets and to
carry on their respective businesses as heretofore or presently conducted, and
all such permits, licenses, franchises, certificates of authority, orders,
authorizations, and approvals are in full force and effect and,  to the
Knowledge of Reliant, no termination, suspension or cancellation of any of
them is threatened.

 

 

(ii) The deposits of Reliant Bank are insured by the FDIC in accordance with
the FDIA to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and Reliant Bank has timely
paid all  premiums and assessments and filed all reports required by the
FDIA. No proceeding for the revocation or termination of such deposit

49  

(o) Taxes.

 

 

(i) The Reliant Parties and their respective Subsidiaries have timely filed
all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to them (all such
required Tax  Returns, collectively, the "Reliant Returns"). All of the
Reliant Returns were, as of their respective dates of filing, true, correct,
and complete in all material respects, and all Taxes due and payable by  the
Reliant Parties and their respective Subsidiaries with respect to the periods
covered by such Reliant Returns have been paid (whether or not shown on any
Reliant Returns). No claim has ever been made against the Reliant Parties or
any of  their respective Subsidiaries by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where Reliant or Reliant Bank or their respective Subsidiaries do not file Tax
Returns that Reliant or Reliant Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries
are or may be  subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.

 

 

(ii) All estimated Taxes required to be paid by or with respect to, or in
respect of the operations of, the Reliant Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries have  been paid to the proper taxing authorities, except to the
extent failure to make any such payment, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Reliant. All Taxes that the  Reliant Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries are or were required to withhold or collect in connection with
any amounts paid or owing to any employee, director, independent contractor,
shareholder, nonresident, creditor, or other third  party have been duly
withheld or collected and have been paid, to the extent required, to the
proper taxing authorities; the Reliant Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries have complied with all information reporting and backup
withholding  requirements, including the maintenance of required records,
with respect to such amounts; and the Reliant Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries have paid all employer contributions and premiums and filed all
Tax Returns with respect to any  employee income Tax withholding, and social
security and unemployment Taxes and premiums, all in compliance with the
withholding provisions of the Code and other applicable Laws, except for
failures to withhold, collect, pay, or file and such  noncompliance that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant.

 

 

(iii) Reliant has not received written notice from any Governmental Entity
that any audit, investigation, examination, deficiency assessment, refund
litigation, or other  proceeding is pending and, to the Knowledge of Reliant,
no such audit, investigation, examination, deficiency assessment, refund
litigation, or other proceeding has been threatened against or with respect to
the Reliant Parties or any of their  respective Subsidiaries in respect of
any Taxes or Tax matters, and to the Knowledge of Reliant there are no facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
deficiency assessment or refund litigation. There are  no unsatisfied
Liabilities for Taxes with respect to any notice of deficiency or similar
document received by the Reliant Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes. No deficiencies have been asserted
against the  Reliant Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries as a
result of an examination by a taxing authority and no issue has been raised by
any examination conducted by any taxing authority in the past three years
that, by application of the same  principles, might result, individually or
in the aggregate, in a proposed material deficiency of Reliant or any of its
Subsidiaries for any other period not so examined. There are no Liens for
Taxes upon any of the properties or assets of the  Reliant Parties or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, other than statutory Liens for current Taxes
not yet due and payable for which adequate reserves have been established.

 

 

(iv) The Reliant Parties are, and have at all times been, in compliance with
the provisions of Section 6011, Section 6111, and Section 6112 of the Code
relating to tax  shelter disclosure, registration, list maintenance, and
record keeping, and with the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including any
predecessor or successor Code provisions or Treasury Regulations, as
applicable), and none of the Reliant Parties  have at any time engaged in any
transaction that would be defined as a "reportable transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b), or any transaction that
would have been a "reportable transaction" if current Law was  in effect at
the time the transaction was entered into. No IRS Form 8886 has been filed
with respect to the Reliant Parties. No Reliant Party has entered into any Tax
shelter or listed transaction with no valid business purpose other than the 
avoidance or reduction of a Tax Liability in a jurisdiction outside the United
States with respect to which there is a significant risk of challenge of such
transaction by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction outside the United
States. The  Reliant Parties have disclosed on all Reliant Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement
of Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.

 

 

 

50  

(p) Labor and Employment Matters. Reliant and Reliant Bank and their 
respective Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws respecting employment, retention of independent contractors,
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, and wages and hours.
There is no  pending or, to the Knowledge of Reliant, threatened suit,
action, claim, or legal, administrative, arbitration, or other proceeding by
or on behalf of any current or former employee of Reliant or Reliant Bank or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (including without limitation any suit,
action, claim, or legal, administrative, arbitration, or other proceeding
alleging noncompliance with applicable Laws  respecting employment,
employment practices, or terms and conditions of employment, but excluding
workers' compensation matters) as to which there is a reasonable probability
of an adverse determination and which if  adversely determined would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Reliant.

 

 

(q) Benefit Plans.

 

 

(i) As used in this _Section 5.2(q)_ , the term "Reliant Benefit Plan" means
any pension, retirement, survivor income,  salary continuation, stock option,
restricted stock, restricted stock unit, stock purchase, stock ownership,
savings, stock appreciation right, capital appreciation, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, consulting, bonus, group insurance,  disability,
severance, change of control, fringe benefit, incentive, cafeteria or Code
Section 125, welfare, or other benefit plans, contracts, agreements, or
arrangements, including without limitation "employee benefit plans" as defined
in  Section 3(3) of ERISA, any incentive or welfare policies, contracts,
plans, or arrangements, including split dollar life insurance arrangements,
and all trust agreements and funding arrangements related thereto, which are
or have been maintained,  sponsored, or contributed to (or required to be
contributed to) by Reliant or Reliant Bank or an ERISA Affiliate for the
benefit of or with respect to any present or former directors, officers,
employees, independent contractors, or consultants  of Reliant or Reliant
Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any spouse or dependent of
any such Person, or to or under which Reliant or Reliant Bank or an ERISA
Affiliate has or may have any Liability.

 

 

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, other than routine claims for benefits,
there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Reliant, threatened claim,
litigation, action,  suit, audit, arbitration, mediation, or other proceeding
(legal, administrative, or otherwise) relating to any Reliant Benefit Plan.
All of the Reliant Benefit Plans have been established, maintained, and
administered in compliance, in all  material respects, with all applicable
requirements of ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws and the terms and
provisions of all contracts or agreements establishing the Reliant Benefit
Plans or pursuant to which they are maintained or  administered. As of the
date of this Agreement, no audit of any Reliant Benefit Plan by the IRS or the
United States Department of Labor is ongoing or, to the Knowledge of Reliant,
threatened.

 

 

(iii) Each Reliant Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a)  of the Code has received a current favorable determination
letter from the IRS (or, in the case of an IRS pre-approved plan, the pre-
approved plan has a current IRS opinion or advisory letter upon which the
Reliant Parties are entitled to rely  under applicable IRS guidance), and, to
the Knowledge of Reliant, there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of any such favorable
determination letter.

 

 

 

51  

(iv) No Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has
been, or is expected by the Reliant  or Reliant Bank or their respective
Subsidiaries to be, incurred with respect to any Reliant Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or with respect to any "single-employer plan"
(as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or  formerly maintained by
the Reliant or Reliant Bank or any ERISA Affiliate. No Reliant Benefit Plan
had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA),
whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most  recent plan
year ending prior to the date of this Agreement; the fair market value of the
assets of each Reliant Benefit Plan exceeds the present value of the "benefit
liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under such Reliant 
Benefit Plan as of the end of the most recent plan year ending prior to the
date of this Agreement, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Reliant Benefit Plan as
of the date of  this Agreement; and no notice of a "reportable event" (as
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the reporting requirement has not
been waived has been required to be filed for any Reliant Benefit Plan within
the 12-month period ending on  the date of this Agreement. Neither Reliant,
Reliant Bank, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, has provided or is
required to provide security to any Reliant Benefit Plan or to any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to  Section 401(a)(29) of the
Code. Neither Reliant, Reliant Bank, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate, has contributed to or is or has been obligated to
contribute to any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37)  of ERISA.

 

 

(r) Information Technology Systems. The Reliant Parties and their Subsidiaries
have in place commercially reasonable data  protection and privacy policies
and procedures designed to protect, safeguard, and maintain the
confidentiality, integrity, and security of (i) their information technology
systems and software owned or purported to be owned by them and (ii) all 
information, data, and transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted
thereby, including personally identifiable information, financial information,
and credit card data (as such information or terms are defined and/or
regulated under  applicable Laws (the "Reliant Data")), against any
unauthorized or improper use, access, transmittal, interruption, modification,
or corruption. Except as has not had and would not  reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Reliant, the Reliant Parties and their Subsidiaries are in compliance with
applicable federal and state confidentiality and data security Laws, 
including without limitation Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the
information security program adopted by the Reliant Parties pursuant to 12
C.F.R. Part 364, and  all applicable card association rules and the payment
card industry data security standards. Except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Reliant, there  currently are not any, and since
January 1, 2017, there have not been any, pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Reliant Parties, threatened claims or written complaints with respect to
unauthorized access to or breaches of the security of (A) any  of the Reliant
Parties' or their Subsidiaries' information technology systems or (B) Reliant
Data (or any unlawful acquisition, use, loss, destruction, compromise, or
disclosure thereof).

 

 

(s) Fairness Opinion. Prior to the Parties' execution of this Agreement, the
board of directors of Reliant received from Piper  Jaffray and Co. an opinion
(which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed in a
written opinion dated the same date) to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion and subject to the  assumptions and qualifications set forth
therein, the Merger Consideration to be issued and paid by Reliant in the
Merger is fair from a financial point of view to Reliant.

(u) Loan Matters.

 

 

(i) All Loans made, originated, or held by Reliant, Reliant Bank or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Reliant Loans") (A) were
made or originated for good, valuable, and adequate consideration in the
ordinary course of business; (B) were solicited and originated, and are and
have been administered and, where applicable,  serviced, and the relevant
Loan files are being and have been maintained, (1) in accordance in all
material respects with the relevant notes or other credit or security
documents, (2) in accordance in all material respects with the applicable 
underwriting and servicing standards of Reliant Bank (and, in the case of
Loans held for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if any, of the
applicable investors), and (3) in accordance with all applicable Laws, except,
as it relates  to clause (3) only, as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Reliant. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant, the
notes or other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the Reliant Loans and all
pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust, and other collateral documents and
security agreements related thereto are  legal, valid, binding and
enforceable (except as enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions).

 

 

(ii) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Reliant,
neither the terms  of any Loan held, originated, made, administered, or
serviced by Reliant or Reliant Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
any of the documentation for any such Loan, the manner in which any such Loan
has been administered or serviced, nor  Reliant's or Reliant Bank's or their
respective Subsidiaries' practices of approving or rejecting Loan applications
violate any Law applicable thereto, including without limitation the Truth in
Lending Act of 1968, as amended; Regulation B,  Regulation O, and Regulation
Z of the Federal Reserve; the CRA; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as
amended; and any applicable federal or state Laws relating to consumer
protection, installment sales, or usury.

 

 

(iii) Reliant Bank's allowance for loan and lease losses is, and shall be as
of the Effective Time, in compliance in all material respects with Reliant's
existing  methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan
and lease losses as well as the standards established by applicable
Governmental Entities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and is and
shall be adequate under all such  standards.

 

 

(iv) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.2(u)(iv)_ of the Reliant Disclosure
Memorandum, none of the Contracts pursuant to  which Reliant Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries has sold Loans or pools of Loans, or participations in Loans
or pools of Loans, contain any Liability on the part of Reliant Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries to repurchase such Loans or interests  therein solely on
account of a payment default by the obligors on such Loans other than in the
case where there has been a material breach of a representation or warranty by
Reliant Bank.

 

 

 

53  

(v) Set forth on _Schedule 5.2(u)(v)_ of the Reliant Disclosure Memorandum is
a true, correct, and complete listing, as of  September 30, 2019, by account
of (A) all Loans of Reliant Bank (1) that are contractually past due 90 days
or more in the payment of principal and/or interest, (2) that are on non-
accrual status, (3) that are classified as "special mention,"  "substandard,"
"doubtful," "loss," or words of similar import, or (4) where the interest rate
terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended
subsequent to the origination of the Loans due to concerns regarding the
borrowers'  ability to pay in accordance with the Loans' original terms; and
(B) all assets classified by Reliant Bank as real estate acquired through
foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure, including in-substance foreclosures,
and all other assets currently  held that were acquired through foreclosure
or in lieu of foreclosure, in each case including the book value thereof as of
September 30, 2019.

 

 

(vi) Each Loan held by Reliant, Reliant Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (A) is evidenced by notes, agreements, or other evidences of
indebtedness that are  true, genuine, and what they purport to be, (B) to the
extent secured, has been secured by valid Liens which have been perfected and
(C) is a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the obligor named therein,
enforceable in accordance with its  terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

 

(vii) The Reliant Parties are not, and have not been since January 1, 2017,
subject to any material fine, suspension, or settlement or other
administrative agreement or  sanction by, or any reduction in any loan
purchase commitment from, any Governmental Entity relating to the origination,
sale, or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.

 

 

(v) Insurance. The Reliant Parties and their respective Subsidiaries are
insured with reputable insurers against such risks and  in such amounts as
the management of Reliant reasonably has determined to be prudent and
consistent with industry practices. The policies of insurance currently held
or maintained by or providing coverage for the Reliant Parties or any of
their  respective Subsidiaries (the "Reliant Insurance Policies") are in full
force and effect, neither the Reliant Parties nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries is in default thereunder,  and no event has occurred which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or permit a
termination, modification, or acceleration thereunder. All premiums due and
payable in respect of the Reliant Insurance Policies have  been timely and
fully paid (to the extent due and payable). To the Knowledge of Reliant, there
is no material claim for coverage by the Reliant Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries pending under any of the Reliant Insurance Policies
as  to which coverage has been denied or disputed, and the Reliant Parties
have not received written notice of any threatened termination of or material
alteration of coverage under any of the Reliant Insurance Policies.

 

 

(w) Investment Securities. Reliant and Reliant Bank and their respective
Subsidiaries have good title to all securities and  commodities owned by them
(except those sold under repurchase agreements), free and clear of any Liens,
except to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the
ordinary course of business to secure obligations of Reliant or Reliant  Bank
or their respective Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued
on the books of Reliant and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP. Reliant
and Reliant Bank and their respective Subsidiaries employ investment,
securities,  commodities, risk management, and other similar policies,
practices, and procedures that are prudent and reasonable in the context of
their respective businesses.

 

 

(x) Tax Treatment of Mergers. Reliant has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent  the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

 

54  

(y) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC, and Customer Information Security.
Reliant Bank received a  rating of "Satisfactory" or better during its most
recent examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. Reliant does not
have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected
to cause Reliant Bank (i) to be  deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance
in any material respect with the CRA and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA purposes by federal banking
regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; (ii) to be  deemed to be operating
in violation, in any material respect, of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as
amended, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money
laundering by the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering Law; or
(iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material
respect with applicable privacy of customer or consumer information
requirements contained in  any federal or state privacy Laws, including
without limitation in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as
amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions
of the information security program adopted by  Reliant Bank. To the
Knowledge of Reliant, no non-public Reliant Bank customer information has been
disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner which
would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause Reliant Bank to  undertake
any significant remedial action. The board of directors of Reliant Bank has
adopted, and Reliant Bank has implemented, an anti-money laundering program
that contains customer identification verification procedures that comply
with  Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act, and such anti-money laundering
program meets the requirements of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder, and Reliant Bank has complied in all material respects
with any requirements  to file reports and other necessary documents as
required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

 

 

(z) Internal Controls. Reliant (i) has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over  financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and
(ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to  Reliant's
outside auditors and the audit committee of Reliant's board of directors (A)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of  the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Reliant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
data, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a  significant role in Reliant's internal control
over financial reporting.

 

 

(aa) Regulatory Capital. Reliant and Reliant Bank are "well-capitalized" as
such term is defined in 12 C.F.R. 225.2 and 12  C.F.R. 325.103, respectively.

 

 

(bb) No Further Representations.

 

 

(i) Except for the representations and warranties made by the Reliant Parties
in this _Article V_ (including the related portions of the Reliant
Disclosure  Memorandum), the Reliant Parties do not make any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Reliant, Merger Sub, or
Reliant Bank, or their respective Subsidiaries, or the respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities,  or conditions (financial or otherwise) of
Reliant, Merger Sub, or Reliant Bank, or their respective Subsidiaries, and
the Reliant Parties hereby disclaim any such other representations or
warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing  disclaimer, except
for the representations and warranties made by the Reliant Parties in this
_Article V_ (including the related portions of the Reliant Disclosure
Memorandum), the Reliant Parties do not make any representation or warranty 
to the Company with respect to (i) any financial projection, forecast,
estimate, budget, or prospective information relating to Reliant, Merger Sub,
or Reliant Bank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the respective
businesses of  Reliant, Merger Sub, or Reliant Bank, or their respective
Subsidiaries, or (ii) any oral or written information presented, delivered, or
made available to the First Advantage Parties in the course of their due
diligence investigation of Reliant  and Reliant Bank and their respective
Subsidiaries or their negotiation of this Agreement or otherwise in the course
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

55  

(ii) Reliant acknowledges and agrees that (A) except as expressly set forth in
_Article IV_ (including the related portions of the First Advantage
Disclosure  Memorandum), neither the Company nor any other Person makes or
has made any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
First Advantage Parties or their respective Subsidiaries or the respective
businesses, operations,  assets, liabilities, or conditions (financial or
otherwise) of the First Advantage Parties and their respective Subsidiaries
and (B) any such other representations or warranties are specifically
disclaimed and Reliant did not rely on any  representation or warranty not
contained in _Article IV_ (including the related portions of the First
Advantage Disclosure Memorandum) when making its decision to enter into this
Agreement and will not rely on any such representation or  warranty in
deciding to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Company's rights under _Section 7.7_ , make or authorize any statement,

provided, however, that prior to the date the shareholders of Company approve
this  Agreement, if the Company's board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company  may, in response to a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this _Section 7.1_ that the
Company's board of directors determines in good faith constitutes or is 
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and subject to providing
48 hours prior written notice of their decision to take such action to Reliant

material terms and  conditions of such Superior Proposal and compliance with

the First Advantage Parties) and (B) participate in  discussions or
negotiations with such Person regarding such Superior Proposal.

 

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth above, the Company
shall promptly (orally within not more than 24 hours and in writing within two

or violation of any provision of this _Section 7.1_ by any of its Subsidiaries
or by  any of its or its Subsidiaries' Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, or representatives (including without limitation any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other
representative retained by such Party or  any of its Subsidiaries) shall be
deemed a breach or violation of this _Section 7.1_ by the Company for which
the Company shall be responsible.

 

 

 

61  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.1_ shall prevent the Company or its
board of directors, as applicable, from (i) taking the actions permitted by

an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal of the Company's obligations pursuant to
this _Section 7.1_.

circumstance, or  condition known to it that (a) constitutes or has caused,
or would reasonably be expected to cause, a material breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of such Party set forth
in this Agreement, provided, however, that no such notification shall (i)

Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a title of executive vice-president or
higher intends to terminate his  or her employment with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, the Company promptly shall give Reliant notice of the same.
The failure of a Party to comply with this Section 7.2 shall not in and of
itself constitute the failure of any condition  set forth in Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3 to be satisfied unless the underlying fact, event, occurrence,
circumstance, or condition would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 to be satisfied.

Advantage Parties, as the case may be, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the party in possession or control of such information (after 
giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense, or similar agreement between the Parties), or contravene any Law,

Section 7.10 _Employee and Benefit Matters._

employee benefit plans, Reliant or Reliant Bank will, as soon as reasonably
practicable after  the Effective Time, provide employees of the Bank who
become employees of Reliant Bank at or immediately following the Effective
Time (the "Continuing Employees") with benefits that are  no less favorable,
in the aggregate, than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Reliant Bank. With respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by Reliant or Reliant Bank, excluding both
any  retiree health care plans or programs maintained by Reliant or Reliant
Bank and any equity compensation or deferred compensation plans or
arrangements maintained by Reliant or Reliant Bank (collectively, "Employee
Plans"), in which any Continuing Employees will participate effective as of or
after the Effective Time, Reliant or Reliant Bank, as appropriate, will
recognize all years of service of Continuing Employees  with the Bank for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes or
purposes of early retirement subsidies under any Employee Plan that is a
defined benefit pension plan) in any Employee Plan in which such Continuing 
Employees may be eligible to participate at or after the Effective Time;
provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such
recognition of service would result in a duplication  of benefits or (ii)
such service was not recognized under a corresponding First Advantage Benefit
Plan. With respect to Employee Plans providing health care, dental, or vision
coverage as well as group life and disability insurance coverage,  Reliant or
Reliant Bank, as appropriate, will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or other
limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new
employees not to  apply to the Continuing Employees or their eligible spouses
and eligible dependents who were covered under a similar First Advantage
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Further, if Continuing
Employees experience a transition in  health care, dental, or vision coverage
during the middle of a plan year, Reliant or Reliant Bank, as appropriate,
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any successor Employee Plan
providing health care, dental, or vision coverage for  Continuing Employees
to give credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and
out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any deductible,
co-payment, or other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by Continuing 
Employees in respect of their participation in the corresponding First
Advantage Benefit Plan during the plan year of the successor Employee Plan
prior to the transition effective date. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, to the extent  permitted by applicable Law and the terms of any
pertinent plan documents, Reliant and its Subsidiaries may after the Effective
Time maintain multiple benefit plans providing health care, dental, or vision
coverage and/or multiple retirement  savings plans.

 

 

 

66  

(b) At the request of Reliant, the Company shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, prior to the Effective Time, all actions reasonably
requested by Reliant  that are necessary or appropriate to (i) cause one or
more of the First Advantage Benefits Plans, except as provided in _Section
7.10(f)_ below (including, without limitation, the First Advantage Bank 401(k)
and Profit Sharing Plan and  the First Advantage Bank Employee Stock Ownership
Plan and Trust) to terminate or be frozen as of or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any First 
Advantage Benefit Plan to cease as of or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) cause the continuation at and after the Effective Time of any
insurance policy or other Contract relating to any First Advantage Benefit
Plan for such period  as may be requested by Reliant, or (iv) facilitate the
merger of any First Advantage Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan
maintained by Reliant or its Subsidiaries. All resolutions, notices, or other
documents adopted, issued, or executed  in connection with the implementation
of this _Section 7.10(b)_ shall be subject to Reliant's prior review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

(c) The Parties will establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate
dollar amount, and subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions, set
forth on _Schedule 7.10(c)_ of the Reliant Disclosure Memorandum to promote
employee retention and to incentivize employee efforts to consummate the
Mergers.

 

 

(d) Reliant will, or will cause Reliant Bank to, provide to (i) employees of
the Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time who are not offered continued
employment  with Reliant or one of its Subsidiaries and (ii) Continuing
Employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Reliant or its
Subsidiaries without cause during the six-month period immediately following
the Effective Time (collectively, "Severed Employees"), and who are not
otherwise entitled to contractual or other severance or change in control
benefits, severance benefits in the amounts set forth on _Schedule 7.10(d)_ of
the Reliant Disclosure Memorandum, taking into account the number of years of
service of the Severed Employees with the Bank prior to the  Effective Time
and with Reliant and its Subsidiaries thereafter; provided that it shall be a
condition to payment of any such severance benefits that the Severed Employee
executes a release of claims,  which release shall be in a form that complies
with Section 409A of the Code and is reasonably acceptable to Reliant. Any
such payments of severance benefits (including the timing of the same) shall
be in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this
_Section 7.10(d)_ , "cause" shall have the same meaning as provided in any
written employment agreement between any Severed Employee and Reliant and/or
its Subsidiaries on the date such Severed Employee's employment is 
terminated, or if no such definition or employment agreement exists, "cause"
shall mean conduct amounting to (i) fraud or dishonesty against or to Reliant
or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Severed Employee's willful misconduct, repeated
refusal to  follow the reasonable directions of his or her superiors, or
knowing violation of Law in the course or scope of performance of services to
or for Reliant or its Subsidiaries; (iii) repeated absences from work without
a reasonable excuse; (iv)  intoxication with alcohol or drugs while on the
premises of Reliant or its Subsidiaries during regular business hours; (v) a
conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime
involving dishonesty; or (vi) a breach or  violation of the terms of any
agreement to which the Severed Employee and Reliant or its Subsidiaries are
parties.

 

 

 

67  

(e) This _Section 7.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 7.10_ , express or implied,
shall  confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.10_. Nothing contained in
this _Section 7.10_ , express or implied, (i) shall be construed to establish,
amend, or  modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement or
(ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Reliant,
or Reliant Bank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to
amend, modify, or terminate any  benefit plan, program, agreement, or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored, or maintained by any
of them. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this
_Section 7.10_ shall not create any right in any  employee of the Company or
the Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any other Person, to
continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Reliant, or Reliant Bank,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (and shall  not limit
the right of the Surviving Corporation, Reliant, or Reliant Bank, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to terminate the employment of
any employee), or any compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

 

 

(f) Subject to the occurrence of the Closing, the First Advantage Bank
Employees Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") shall be terminated by the Bank prior
to the Closing  Date. In connection with the termination of the ESOP and the
Merger, all accounts shall be fully vested, all outstanding indebtedness of
the ESOP shall be repaid by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated
shares of Company Common Stock to  the Company, at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, all remaining shares of Company Common Stock
held by the ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and the balance of the unallocated  shares and any other
unallocated assets remaining in the ESOP after repayment of the ESOP loan
shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of the ESOP participants who
are employed as of the date of termination of the ESOP based on their 
Company Stock Account balances under the ESOP as of the date of termination of
the ESOP and distributed to ESOP participants after the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Bank shall
take all  such actions as are necessary (with the consent of Reliant, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) to submit the application for
favorable determination letter in advance of the Effective Time, and following
the Effective Time, Reliant  shall use its best efforts in good faith to
obtain such favorable determination letter as promptly as possible (including,
but not limited to, making such changes to the ESOP as may be required by the
IRS as a condition to its issuance of a  favorable determination letter). The
Bank and following the Effective Time, Reliant, will adopt such amendments to
the ESOP to effect the provisions of this _Section 7.10(f)_. Promptly
following the receipt of a favorable determination  letter from the IRS
regarding the qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination, the account
balances in the ESOP shall either be distributed to participants and
beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or 
individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.

Section 7.11 _Indemnification._

 

 

(a) For a period of six years immediately following the Effective Time, (i)

the current and  former directors and officers of the Company and the Bank,
determined as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an
"Indemnified Party"), against any and all costs and expenses  (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, and liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or 
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including matters related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at,
or after the Effective Time,  and based on or pertaining to the fact that he
or she was a director, officer or employee of the Company or the Bank or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, or was serving at the request of the Company
or the Bank as a director, officer,  employee, agent, trustee, or partner of
another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan,
or other entity, to the fullest extent such Indemnified Party would have been
entitled to be so indemnified, defended, and held  harmless under the charter
and bylaws of the Company and the Bank as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred by an Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted  under the
charter and bylaws of the Company and the Bank as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement; provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are

ultimately  determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section
7.11_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation,  shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation of the same;
provided that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Surviving
Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any  Liability it
may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually and
materially prejudice the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation (whether arising before or
after the  Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses  subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof, except that, (A) if the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or (B) if counsel for the Indemnified Party advises
the Surviving Corporation  in writing that there are legal defenses available
to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Surviving Corporation or that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between the Surviving  Corporation and the Indemnified
Party that make joint representation inappropriate, the Indemnified Party may
retain its own legal counsel and the Surviving Corporation shall pay, as
statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and  expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless there are multiple Indemnified Parties who have conflicts
of interest), (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense
thereof,  (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent, and (iv) the Surviving
Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder in the event a federal or state
banking agency or a court of  competent jurisdiction shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

immediately prior to the Effective  Time covered by the First Advantage
Parties' existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (the
"Tail Insurance"), which Tail Insurance shall provide for at least the same 
coverage and coverage amounts as, and contain terms and conditions not
materially less advantageous than, those currently provided for by the First
Advantage Parties' existing directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy; provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of Reliant,

successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations of
the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

Registration Statement and such state securities Laws or "blue sky"
registrations or exemptions current and in effect for so long as is necessary
to consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the First Advantage Parties
and their shareholders as may be reasonably requested by Reliant in connection
with the same. Reliant shall have  primary responsibility for preparing and

promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of  this Agreement furnish
all data and information relating to it and its Subsidiaries, and its and its
Subsidiaries' directors, officers, and shareholders, as the other Parties may
reasonably request for the purpose of including such data and  information in
the Registration Statement and/or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The
Company expressly agrees to cooperate with Reliant and its legal and
accounting advisors in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions,
consents, and  letters from its legal and financial advisor(s) and
independent auditor(s), and in taking such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by Reliant, in connection with the Registration Statement or the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each  Party covenants and agrees that none
of the information supplied or to be supplied by such Party for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement or any amendment or  supplement thereto becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of  the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto will, on the date

(iii) any other document filed with any Governmental Entity in connection with

the provisions of applicable Law. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will

of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations
thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by any Party
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by any other Party or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or 
incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each Party
covenants and agrees that, in the event such Party becomes aware of any
information furnished by it or any of its Subsidiaries that would cause any of
the statements  in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, or any other document filed with any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be
false or misleading with respect to any  material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, such Party will promptly inform the other Parties thereof in
writing and take all necessary steps to correct the Registration  Statement
or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or other document, as applicable.

the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including without
limitation the Merger, the Second Step Merger, or the Bank Merger) shall have
been denied by final and non-appealable action of such Governmental Entity or
any application or request therefor  shall have been permanently withdrawn at
the request of a Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the Reliant
Parties shall not be entitled to exercise their  right of termination under
this _Section 9.1(d)_ if such denial or withdrawal shall be due to the failure
of the Reliant Parties to perform or observe their obligations and covenants
set forth in this Agreement, and that the Company shall  not be entitled to
exercise its right of termination under this _Section 9.1(d)_ if such denial
or withdrawal shall be due to the failure of the Company to perform or observe
its obligations and covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(e) By either the Reliant Parties or the Company, in the event any court or
other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final,
non-appealable  order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that the Reliant Parties  shall not be entitled to exercise their right of
termination under this _Section 9.1(e)_ if such action of such court or other
Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of the Reliant Parties to
perform or observe their obligations  and covenants set forth in this
Agreement, and that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right of
termination under this _Section 9.1(e)_ if such action of such court or other
Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of  the Company to perform or
observe its obligations and covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(f) By either the Reliant Parties or the Company, in the event the Merger is
not consummated by August 31, 2020, unless (i) in the event of termination by
the Reliant  Parties, the failure to consummate the Merger by such date shall
be due to the failure of the Reliant Parties to perform or observe their
obligations and covenants set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) in the event
of termination by the Company,  the failure to consummate the Merger by such
date shall be due to the failure of the Company to perform or observe its
obligations and covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(g) By the Reliant Parties, in the event that prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the Company's
charter and  bylaws and applicable Law (i) the Company breaches _Section 7.1_
of this Agreement or materially breaches _Section 7.7_ of this Agreement or
(ii) the board of directors of the Company does not publicly recommend in the
Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the shareholders of the Company or, after
having made such recommendation, subsequently makes a Company Change of
Recommendation.

 

 

(h) By the Reliant Parties, in the event a tender offer or exchange offer for
20% or more of any class or series of outstanding shares of Company Stock is
commenced  (other than by Reliant or its Subsidiaries) and the Company's
board of directors recommends that the shareholders of the Company tender
their shares in such tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise fails to
recommend that such shareholders  reject such tender offer or exchange offer
within the 10 business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act.

 

 

 

77  

(i) By the Company, in the event that, prior to the approval of the Stock
Issuance Proposal by the shareholders of Reliant, the board of  directors of
Reliant (i) fails to call, give notice of, convene, and hold the Reliant
Meeting in accordance with _Section 7.8_ , (ii) fails to publicly recommend 
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus the approval of the Stock Issuance
Proposal by the shareholders of Reliant or, (iii) after having made such
recommendation,  subsequently makes a Reliant Change of Recommendation.

 

 

(j) By the Company, at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company in accordance with the Company's charter and
bylaws and  applicable Law, for the purpose of entering into an agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that there has been no material
breach by the Company or Bank of _Section 7.1_ or _Section    7.7_.

 

 

(k) By the Company, if both (i) the Average Closing Price (as defined below)
is less than $18.5464 and (ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average
Closing Price  by $23.1830, is less than (B) the difference between (1) the
number obtained by dividing the Index Value (as defined below) on the
Determination Date (as defined below) by $3,706.69, and (2) 0.20; provided, 
however, that the Company must elect to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(k)_ by written notice (the "Termination Notice") given to Reliant
within two  Business Days after the Determination Date and that the Company's
right of termination shall be subject to the right of Reliant provided for
below to increase the Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration. During
the three Business Day period  immediately following the day on which Reliant
receives the Termination Notice (the "Election Period"), Reliant shall have
the right and option, in its sole and absolute discretion, to  increase the
Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration such that, as a result of such
adjustment, the sum of (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration (i.e., the total
value of the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company  Common Stock then outstanding) and (ii) the (x) aggregate Stock
Consideration (i.e., the total number of shares of Reliant Common Stock to be
issued as Merger Consideration as calculated by multiplying the Exchange Ratio
by the number of shares  of Company Common Stock then outstanding)
_multiplied by_ (y) the Average Closing Price, calculated as of the
Determination Date, shall be no less than the Minimum Merger Consideration (as
defined below); provided  that in no event shall the Cash Consideration be
increased such that as a result of such increase the Merger would not qualify
as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. If Reliant elects to
increase the Cash Consideration and/or  Stock Consideration as aforesaid,
Reliant shall give written notice of such election (the "Fill Notice") to the
Company during the Election Period, which Fill Notice shall specify the 
amount of any such increase and whether such increase will be in the form of
additional Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration, whereupon no
termination of this Agreement shall occur, or be deemed to have occurred,
pursuant to this _Section    9.1(k)_ and this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms (with the Cash
Consideration and/or Stock Consideration modified in accordance with this
_Section 9.1(k)_ as set forth in the Fill Notice).  If Reliant does not
timely elect to increase the Cash Consideration and/or Stock Consideration as
aforesaid, then the Company may terminate this Agreement at any time after the
end of the Election Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the term 
"Average Closing Price" means the volume-weighted average closing price per
share of Reliant Common Stock as reported on Nasdaq (or such other exchange or
market on which the Reliant  Common Stock shall then trade) for the 15
consecutive Trading Days ending on (and including) the Determination Date; the
term "Determination Date" means that certain date which is the  fifth
Business Day prior to the Closing Date; the term "Index Value," on a given
date, means the closing index value for the Nasdaq Bank Index as reported
in    The Wall Street Journal; and the term "Minimum Merger Consideration"
means the sum of (i) the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares
of Company Common Stock then  outstanding, plus (ii) the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the Determination
Date, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (z) $18.5464.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section    10.7_ , for
purposes of this _Section 9.1(k)_ , notices shall be deemed given, delivered,
and effective when transmitted via confirmed email; provided that if any such
email is transmitted after  5:00 p.m. local time of the recipient, or on a
day other than a Business Day, it shall be deemed given, delivered, and
effective on the next following Business Day.

(l) By Reliant, if the First Advantage Tangible Common Equity is less than
$73,000,000.

 

 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this Article IX, this Agreement shall, subject to
Section 9.3,  become null and void and have no further force or effect and
the Parties shall have no further or continuing liability or obligations under
this Agreement, except that (a) Section 7.3(d), Section 7.6, this Section 9.2,
Section 9.3, and Article X  of this Agreement shall survive any termination
of this Agreement and (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no Party shall be relieved of or released from any
liability or damages  arising out of such Party's fraud or willful or
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 9.3 _Termination Fee._

 

 

(a) In the event (i) this Agreement is terminated by Reliant pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ and (ii) at any time after the date of this Agreement and at
or before the  Company Meeting (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
adjournment or postponement thereof) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
received by or communicated or otherwise made known to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, which has not  been withdrawn prior to the date of the
termination of this Agreement, and within 12 months after the date of
termination of this Agreement the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates,  any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to
above), then the Company shall pay to Reliant a termination fee of $6,000,000
(the "Termination Fee")    on the earlier of the date of the Company's or
its Subsidiary's, as applicable, execution of such definitive agreement or
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal _;_ provided    that, for
purposes of this _Section 9.3(a)_ , all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead be deemed to be references to
"50%."

 

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Reliant Parties pursuant
to _Section 9.1(g)_ or _Section 9.1(h)_ , the  Company shall pay Reliant the
Termination Fee not later than two Business Days after the date of termination
of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(j)_ , the Company shall pay to Reliant the Termination Fee not
later than two  Business Days after the date of termination of this
Agreement.

 

 

Any termination fee and other amounts payable in accordance with this _Section
9.3_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Reliant or the  Company, as applicable. The Parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that
absent such agreements the Parties would not have entered  into this
Agreement. In the event a Party fails to timely make payment of any amounts
due and payable by such Party under this _Section 9.3_ , the Party failing to
make such payment shall pay or reimburse the Party entitled to receive such 
payment all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses and court costs) incurred by such Party in connection with any
action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with  interest on the amount of any such amounts unpaid at
the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall
Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts  were
required to be paid until the date of actual payment. The Termination Fee and
other amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty and, except in the case  of fraud or willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the
Parties in the event this Agreement is terminated under the circumstances
described in _Sections 9.3(a)_ - _(c)_.

A. Concurrently with the parties' execution of this Agreement, Reliant
Bancorp, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("Reliant"), PG Merger Sub, Inc., a
Tennessee  corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Reliant ("
_Merger Sub_ " and together with Reliant, collectively, the " _Reliant
Parties_ "), and the  Company, have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as the same may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_
") providing for, among other things, the merger of  Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and the conversion of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (as defined below) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 

 

B. As a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
Company has required that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement.

 

 

C. In order to induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
Shareholder is willing to make certain representations, warranties, covenants,
and agreements with respect to the shares of common  stock, $1.00 par value,
of Reliant (" _Reliant Common Stock_ ") "beneficially owned" (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 (" _Rule 13d-3_ ") promulgated by the  Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended) by the Shareholder, the number of which is set forth below the
Shareholder's signature on the  signature page to this Agreement (the "
_Owned Shares_ ," and together with any additional shares of Reliant Common
Stock or any  other class or series of capital stock of Reliant contemplated
by _Section 8_ hereof, the " _Shares_ ").

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 

1. _Defined Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

 

2. _Representations of Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents and warrants to Company that:

 

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder is the beneficial owner
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) of, and has good title to, all of the Owned
Shares. The Owned Shares are owned by the  Shareholder free and clear of any
and all Liens, and, except for this Agreement, there are no options or other
rights, agreements, arrangements, or commitments of any kind to which the
Shareholder is a party or by or to which the Shareholder or  the Owned Shares
are bound or subject relating to the pledge, transfer, disposition, or voting
of any of the Owned Shares, and there is no voting trust or voting agreement
with respect to the Owned Shares.

 

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder does not beneficially
own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) any shares of Reliant Common Stock, or
any shares of any other class or series of capital  stock of Reliant, other
than the Owned Shares.

 

 

(c) The Shareholder has all necessary legal power and authority and legal
capacity to enter into, execute, and deliver this Agreement and to perform
fully the Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This  Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Shareholder enforceable against

FORM OF LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

 

 


 

 

 

LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

 


 

 

THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this "Lock-Up Agreement"), dated as of [•], 2019, is
entered into by and between Reliant Bancorp, Inc., a  Tennessee corporation
("Reliant"), and the undersigned shareholder (the "Shareholder") of First
Advantage Bancorp, a  Tennessee corporation (the "Company").

 


 

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by
Reliant, and in consideration of the Company, Reliant, and Merger Sub entering
into that certain Agreement and Plan of  Merger dated as of October 22, 2019,
(the "Merger Agreement"), the receipt and sufficiency of such consideration
being hereby acknowledged and accepted, and in order to induce  Reliant to
enter into the Merger Agreement, the Shareholder, who will receive [--] shares
of Reliant Common Stock as partial consideration for the Shareholder's shares
of Company Common  Stock in connection with the Merger, hereby agrees with
Reliant as follows:

 


 

 

1. During the period commencing on the date on which the Effective Time occurs and ending at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the date  which is 90 days following the date on which the Effective Time occurs (the "Lock-Up Period"), the Shareholder will not directly or indirectly, and will not take any action to:

 


 

 

(a) offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option, warrant, or contract to
purchase, purchase any option, warrant, or contract to  sell, transfer,
pledge, or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any transaction which is
designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition
(whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition or 
otherwise) of any shares of Reliant Common Stock now owned or hereafter
acquired, or with respect to which the Shareholder has or hereafter acquires
the power of disposition, including shares of Reliant Common Stock received by
or to be  received by the Shareholder pursuant to the Merger Agreement;

 


 

 

(b) enter into any swap or other derivative transaction that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits  or risks of
ownership of Reliant Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Reliant Common Stock or other securities, in cash, or
otherwise; or

 


 

 

(c) publicly disclose an intention to effect any transaction contemplated by
clauses (a) or (b) of this _Section 1_.

 


 

 

2. Any attempted transfer of Reliant Common Stock in violation of this Lock-Up Agreement will be of no effect and null and void,  regardless of whether the purported transferee has any actual or constructive knowledge of the transfer restrictions set forth in this Lock-Up Agreement, and will not be recorded on the stock transfer records of Reliant.

 


 

 

3. This Lock-Up Agreement will not prohibit the Shareholder from making transfers of Reliant Common Stock:

 


 

 

(a) if the Shareholder is a natural person, (i) as a bona fide gift of shares
of Reliant Common Stock; (ii) by operation of law, such  as pursuant to a
divorce settlement or decree; (iii) by will or by intestate succession; or
(iv) to any entity directly or indirectly controlled by or under common
control with the Shareholder; or

 


 

 

(b) if the Shareholder is a trust, to any grantors or beneficiaries of the
trust;

 


 

     

provided, however, that with respect to each of the transfers described in
clauses (a) and (b) above, (i) such transfer is not for value and (ii) prior 
to such transfer, the donee, distributee, transferee, or the trustee or legal
guardian on behalf of any donee, distributee, or transferee, or the grantor or
beneficiary, as applicable, of the trust agrees in writing to be bound by the
terms  of this Lock-Up Agreement. For purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement, the
terms "controls," "controlled by," and "under common control with" shall mean
the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of  the management and policies of a Person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.

 


 

 

4. The Shareholder also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with Reliant and its transfer agent and  registrar against the transfer of the Shareholder's shares of Reliant Common Stock, except in compliance with this Lock-Up Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Reliant and its transfer agent are each hereby authorized to decline to  make any transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Agreement. Reliant may cause a legend in the form set forth below, or a legend substantially equivalent thereto, to be placed upon any  certificates or other documents, ledgers, or instruments evidencing the Shareholder's ownership of Reliant Common Stock:

 


 

 

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT ARE SUBJECT TO AND MAY ONLY BE
TRANSFERRED IN COMPLIANCE WITH A LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON
FILE  AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF RELIANT BANCORP, INC.

 


 

 

5. If the Merger Agreement is terminated without the consummation of the Merger, this Lock-Up Agreement shall automatically  terminate and shall be of no further force and effect.

 


 

 

6. Reliant agrees that upon the earlier of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement or (ii) the expiration of the Lock-Up Period,  it shall immediately and solely at Reliant's own expense instruct Reliant's transfer agent to remove any legend placed upon any certificates or other documents, ledgers, or instruments evidencing the Shareholder's ownership of Reliant  Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement.

 


 

 

7. The Shareholder hereby represents and warrants that the Shareholder has full power and authority and legal capacity to enter into  this Lock-Up Agreement. Upon request, the Shareholder will execute any additional documents necessary in connection with the enforcement hereof. The Shareholder may not assign or delegate this Lock-Up Agreement or any of the Shareholder's  rights, interests, duties, or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Reliant. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Lock-Up Agreement and any obligations of the Shareholder hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs,  executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns of the Shareholder.

 


 

 

8. The Shareholder understands that Reliant will proceed with the Merger in reliance on this Lock-Up Agreement. Moreover, the  Shareholder understands and agrees that Reliant and the Company are relying upon the accuracy, completeness, and truth of the Shareholder's representations, warranties, agreements, and certifications contained in this Lock-Up Agreement.

 


 

 

9. Reliant and the Shareholder agree that irreparable damage would occur if this Lock-Up Agreement is not performed in accordance  with the terms hereof and that Reliant shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. If  Reliant institutes any legal suit, action, or proceeding (a "Legal Proceeding") against the  Shareholder to enforce, or otherwise arising out of, this Lock-Up Agreement, Reliant shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all other damages to which it may be entitled, all costs Reliant incurs in connection with such Legal  Proceeding, including attorneys' fees and expenses and court costs, if the Shareholder is found by a court to be at fault and liable.

All notices, requests, consents, and other communications required or permitted under or related to this Lock-Up Agreement shall be in writing and shall be  deemed given, delivered, and effective (i) when delivered, if delivered personally, (ii) on the third Business Day after mailing, if mailed by first class United States Mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or (iii) on the  first Business Day after mailing, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case addressed to, in the case of the Shareholder, the Shareholder's address set forth on the signature  page hereto, and, in the case of Reliant or the Company, their respective addresses set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 


 

 

11. This Lock-Up Agreement shall be governed by, and construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of  Tennessee, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

 


 

 

12. EACH OF THE SHAREHOLDER AND RELIANT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY HEREBY (A) IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION OF THE STATE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE LOCATED IN NASHVILLE, DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE, OR IN THE EVENT (BUT ONLY IN THE EVENT) THAT NO SUCH STATE COURT HAS JURISDICTION, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE  MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE, NASHVILLE DIVISION (THE "TENNESSEE COURTS"), IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING OR OTHER CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING UNDER, ARISING OUT OF,  OR RELATED TO THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, (B) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT AS A DEFENSE IN OR TO ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING OR OTHER CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING THAT THE SHAREHOLDER  OR RELIANT, AS APPLICABLE, IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE TENNESSEE COURTS, THAT SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING OR OTHER CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN THE TENNESSEE COURTS OR THAT THE  VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE, OR THAT THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE CONSTRUED, INTERPRETED, OR ENFORCED IN OR BY THE TENNESSEE COURTS, AND (C) IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS A PART OF OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH LEGAL  PROCEEDING OR OTHER CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY THE TENNESSEE COURTS.

13. This Lock-Up Agreement represents the entire understanding of Reliant and the Shareholder with respect to the subject matter  hereof and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings, and arrangements, whether written or oral, between Reliant and the Shareholder with respect to such subject matter.

 


 

 

14. This Lock-Up Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of or by each of Reliant and the  Shareholder.

 


 

 

 

3  

15. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Lock-Up Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the  Merger Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," and "including" are used in this Lock-Up Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation," whether or not actually followed by such words. Any  singular term used in this Lock-Up Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term the singular. Any gender reference in this Lock-Up Agreement shall be deemed to include all genders. Reliant and the Shareholder have  participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Lock-Up Agreement, and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Lock-Up Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by Reliant and  the Shareholder and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Reliant or the Shareholder by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Lock-Up Agreement.

 


 

 

16. This Lock-Up Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all  of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

commence, or shall be deemed to have commenced, immediately upon Employee
first having access to such Confidential Information and shall continue during
and after Employee's employment by Employer  until such time as such
Confidential Information has become public knowledge other than as a result of
Employee's breach of this Agreement or a breach by any person acting in
concert with or at the direction of Employee or on Employee's  behalf.

 


 

 

 

3

ownership by Employee of less than 5% of any class of equity securities of a
Competing Business.

 


 

 

(b) _Non-Solicitation of Customers_. Employee agrees that, during the period
of Employee's employment by  Employer and, following the termination of
Employee's employment for any reason, for the duration of the Post-Termination
Period, Employee will not directly or indirectly (except on behalf of
Employer), on Employee's own behalf or in the  service of or on behalf of
others, solicit, divert, or appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert, or
appropriate, any business from any customers of Company or Bank or their
successors or any of their Affiliates, including prospective  customers
actively sought by Company or Bank or their successors or any of their
Affiliates with whom Executive has or had contact during the last two years of
Executive's employment with Employer for purposes of selling, offering, or 
providing products or services that are competitive with those sold, offered,
or provided by Company or Bank or their successors or any of their Affiliates.

 


 

 

(c) _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. Employee agrees that, during the period
of Employee's employment by  Employer and, following the termination of
Employee's employment for any reason, for the duration of the Post-Termination
Period, Employee will not directly or indirectly, on Employee's own behalf or
in the service of or on behalf of  others, solicit, recruit, or hire away, or
attempt to solicit, recruit, or hire away, any employee of Company or Bank or
their successors or any of their Affiliates, regardless of whether such
employee is a full-time, part-time, or  temporary employee or such employee's
employment is pursuant to a written agreement, for a determined period, or at
will.

 


 

 

(d) _Non-Disparagement_. Employee agrees that, both during the period  of
Employee's employment by Employer and following the termination of Employee's
employment, Employee will not make any disparaging statements or remarks
(written or oral) about Company or Bank or their successors or any of their 
Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, agents, or representatives. This non-disparagement provision
shall not apply (i) if Employee is subpoenaed or ordered by a court or other
governmental  authority to testify or give evidence and must, of course,
respond truthfully, (ii) to conduct otherwise protected by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended, or other applicable law, including truthful, good-
faith reports of possible  violations of law to a governmental agency,
entity, or official, (iii) if Employee provides truthful information to a
governmental agency, entity, or official, or (iv) to conduct or testimony in
the context of enforcing the terms of this  Agreement. Employer agrees that,
following the termination of Employee's employment, Employer will instruct its
directors and executive officers to refrain from making any disparaging
statements or remarks (written or oral) about  Employee.

 


 

 

 

4  

(e) _Modification_. The Parties agree that the provisions of this Agreement
represent a reasonable  balancing of their respective interests and have
attempted to limit the restrictions imposed on Employee to those necessary to
protect Company and Bank and their successors and any of their Affiliates from
inevitable disclosure of  Confidential Information and/or unfair competition.
The Parties agree that, if the scope or enforceability of this Agreement is in
any way disputed at any time and an arbitrator, court, or other trier of fact
determines that the scope of  the restrictions contained in this Agreement is
unenforceable or overbroad, then such arbitrator, court, or other trier of
fact may modify the scope of the restrictions contained in this Agreement to
allow such restrictions to not be  overbroad and to be enforceable.

 


 

 

(f) _Tolling_. Employee agrees that, in the event Employee breaches this
Section 3, the Post-Termination  Period shall be tolled during, and therefore
extended by, the period of such breach.

 


 

 

(g) _Remedies_. Employee agrees that the covenants contained in Section 2 and
this Section 3 are of the  essence of this Agreement; that each of such
covenants is reasonable and necessary to protect the business, interests, and
properties of Company and Bank and their successors and their Affiliates; and
that irreparable loss and damage may  be suffered by Company and Bank and
their successors and their Affiliates should Employee breach any of such
covenants. Therefore, Employee agrees and consents that, in addition to all
other remedies provided by or available at law or in  equity, Company and
Bank and their successors or their Affiliates shall be entitled to a temporary
restraining order and temporary and permanent injunctions to prevent a breach
or contemplated or threatened breach of any of the covenants  contained in
Section 2 or Section 3 of this Agreement and that, in such event, Company and
Bank and their successors and their Affiliates shall not be required to post a
bond. Company and Bank and Employee agree that all remedies  available to
Company and Bank and their successors and their Affiliates shall be
cumulative.

 


 

 

(h) _Consideration_. Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in
this Agreement are reasonable  and necessary to protect the legitimate
interests of Company and Bank and their successors and their Affiliates and
constitute a material inducement to Company and Bank and their successors to
consummate the transactions contemplated by  the Merger Agreement and the
Bank Merger Agreement.

 


 

 

4. _Severability_. The Parties agree that each of the provisions included in this Agreement is separate,  distinct, and severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and that the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.  Further, if any provision of this Agreement is ruled invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction because of a conflict between the provision and any applicable law, rule, regulation, or public policy, the provision shall  be redrawn to make the provision consistent with, and valid and enforceable under, such law, rule, regulation, or public policy.

 


 

 

5. _No Set-Off by Employee_. The existence of any claim, demand, action, or cause of action by Employee  against Company or Bank or their successors or any of their Affiliates, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Company and Bank and their successors or their Affiliates of  any rights under this Agreement.
