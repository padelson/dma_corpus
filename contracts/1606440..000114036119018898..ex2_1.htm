          fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date; the term &#8220;<font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Index Value</font>,&#8221; on a given date, means the closing index value for the Nasdaq Bank Index as reported <font style="color: #000000;">in


          </font><font style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">The Wall Street Journal</font>; and the term &#8220;Minimum Merger Consideration&#8221; means the sum of (i) the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock then
          outstanding,&#160; plus (ii) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the Determination Date, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (z) $18.5464. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in <u>Section
