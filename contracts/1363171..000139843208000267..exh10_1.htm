upon the Closing of the Transactions. The Company Common Stock shall have a
fair market value of $5.00 for purposes of such cashless exercise. Each such
share of Company Common Stock received upon the exercise of the T1 Warrant
without any further action on the part of the holder thereof shall be
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii). 

 

(ii) _T2 Warrants and T3 Warrants_. Certain holders of the T2 Warrants
and T3 Warrants have entered into Exchange Agreements in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ providing for the exchange of their T2 Warrants and T3
Warrants for:

 

(1) for each share of Company Common Stock for which such T2 Warrant or
T3 Warrant is currently exercisable (A) a warrant in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ (the "New Warrant"), providing that such holder shall have the
right to receive a warrant to acquire 0.25 shares of Parent Common Stock
exercisable at $9.00 per share expiring on January 28, 2011 for a total number
of New Warrants not to exceed 2,500,000 in the aggregate and (B) the right to
receive 1/10th of a share of Parent Common Stock upon the satisfaction of the
Warrant Condition for a total number of shares of Parent Common Stock not to

(2) Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Account up to 1,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.5 hereof to satisfy its

be released to Parent and cancelled pursuant to Section 3.5.

 

(iii) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause all remaining
holders of the T3 Warrants who have not previously exercised their T3
Warrants, to exchange their T3 Warrants on the same terms and conditions as
the exchanging holders pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. To the extent such
holders still do not exercise their rights, such T3 Warrants shall remain
outstanding in accordance with their terms.

 

3.2. _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the First Merger, but in lieu thereof Parent

all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received
by such holder (other than those that would be received pursuant to Section

3.3. _Appraisal Rights_. Shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Mergers or consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively,
the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive Parent
Common Stock, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. If, after the First
Merger Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses such holders right to appraisal, each such share shall be treated as if
it has been converted as of the First Merger Effective Time into a right to
receive Parent Common Stock as set forth in Section 3.1(a)(iii)(1). The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, (B) withdrawals of such demands,
and (C) any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company in connection with such demands and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL prior to the First Merger Effective Time. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or as otherwise
required by any applicable law, make any payment with respect to any such
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands and shall
not distribute any portion of the Common Stock Merger Consideration to any
holder that has not lost its appraisal rights.

 

3.4. _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) At or prior to the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall engage
a nationally-recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange
Agent"). At the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, for
exchange in accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to the Closing Stock Payment pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii)(1)(x) (other than
any Dissenting Shares) and for the benefit of the holders of Company Preferred
Stock immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, for exchange in
accordance with Article III, through the Exchange Agent, the Cash Merger
Consideration. In addition, Parent shall make available by depositing with
the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the First Merger
Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.2 and any dividends or distributions
to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to
Section 3.4(c). All cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange
Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 

(b) Promptly after the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (other than any Dissenting
Shares) (the "Certificates"), which at the

 


  

 

\- 20 -

  

 



 

First Merger Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii) or (iii) hereof, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 3.2 and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 3.4(c). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor Cash Merger Consideration to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii) and a certificate
or certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder)
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) (which shall
be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested), payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 3.2 and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 3.4(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
certificates representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.4(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the First Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(iii) hereof (and
any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2 or Section 3.4(c)) upon such
surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount payable
pursuant to Section 3.2 or Section 3.4(c).

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the First Merger Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.2
hereof, until such Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this
Article III. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without
interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to this Article
III, together with any cash payable in lieu of a

 


  

 

\- 21 -

  

 



 

fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2 and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the First Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the First Merger Effective Time and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be
required thereon.

 

(d) All shares of Parent Common Stock, issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III and
any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii), Section 3.2 or Section 3.4(c)
and all shares of Parent Common Stock placed into Escrow shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Certificates. At
the First Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the First Merger Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Company Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time. If, after the First Merger Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the First Merger Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
III.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (other than any shares of Parent
Common Stock held in Escrow) which remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates six months after the First Merger Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Second Merger Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any holders
of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III (other
than Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2
and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 3.4(c).

 

(f) None of Parent, Merger Subs, the Company or the Exchange Agent or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to five years after the First Merger Effective Time, or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, or any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock issuable in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 


  

 

\- 22 -

  

 



 

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such investment
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former stockholders of the
Company after the First Merger Effective Time pursuant to this Article III.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
pursuant to this Article III shall promptly be paid to Parent.

 

(h) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person who was a holder of Company Stock immediately prior to the First Merger
Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been
paid.

 

(i) In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit (without the posting
of a bond) of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common
Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 3.4(b), cash for fractional
shares pursuant to Section 3.2 and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 3.4(c); provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement
of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

3.5. _Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent, the Stockholders
Representative and the escrow agent ("Escrow Agent") shall enter into an
escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the "Escrow
Agreement"), pursuant to which the EBITDA Stock and Warrant Stock portions of
the Common Stock Merger Consideration (other than portions in respect of the
Dissenting Shares) and Additional Warrant Stock (such amount being defined as
the "Escrowed Stock") shall be deposited into escrow (the "Escrow Account"),
shall be subject in all events to the provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and shall be distributed to the holders of Company Common
Stock as follows: (i) an amount equal to EBITDA Stock of the Escrowed Stock
on or prior to the EBITDA Escrow Release Date (as defined below) shall be

parties hereto shall commence preparing the necessary applications (including
any notices, reports, registrations and other filings) with the FCC seeking
the FCC Consents set forth on _Schedule 6.1(a)(i)_ , and such submissions
shall be filed with the applicable authorities as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
date hereof). Each party shall provide the other party with all information
necessary for the preparation of such applications on a timely basis,
including those portions of such applications which are required to be
completed by each party.

 

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, the
parties hereto shall commence preparing the necessary applications (including
any notices, reports, registrations and other filings) with the State PUCs
seeking the State PUC Consents set forth on _Schedule 6.1(a)(ii)_ , and such
submissions shall be filed with the applicable authorities as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
date hereof). Each party shall provide the other parties with all information

including those portions of such applications which are required to be
completed by the first party. In addition, the parties hereto shall cooperate
to make any notice or ownership filings required in connection with this
matter on a timely basis and to assist in the process of obtaining approvals

approvals required in connection with the financing contemplated by the Credit

of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to prosecute the
FCC applications and the State PUC applications in good faith and with due
diligence before the FCC and the State PUCs and in connection therewith shall
take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably required in connection

seeking to overturn the grant of the FCC Consent or grant of any of the State

causing to be withheld) under Section 1445 of the Code).

survive this Agreement and shall not expire and may not be altered in any way
without the express written consent of Parent.
