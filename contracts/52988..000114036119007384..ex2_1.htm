(a) _Provided_ that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_ , as promptly as practicable after the date 
hereof (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date
hereof), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence,

(subject to the  Offer Conditions, including the Minimum Condition) all the
outstanding Common Stock (other than the Shares cancelled or converted

Price. The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of Merger Sub to
accept for payment, purchase and pay for any shares of Common Stock validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer,  shall be subject only
to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date that number of shares of Common Stock (excluding
shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery  procedures
but not yet delivered) which, together with the number of shares of Common
Stock (if any) then owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries, represents at least a
majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (collectively, the "
_Minimum Condition_ "); (ii) this Agreement not having been terminated in
accordance with its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ "); and (iii) the
satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition and

(b) Subject to the satisfaction  of the Minimum Condition and the Termination
Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the
other Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) (i) promptly (and in any event no later than  one (1) Business Day) after
the Expiration Date accept for payment and purchase all shares of Common Stock
validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time
of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance     Time_ ") and (ii) promptly (and
in any event no later than one (1) Business Day) after the applicable
Expiration Date cause the Paying Agent to pay for such shares of Common Stock.
Subject to _Section 2.9_ , the Offer Price payable in respect of each share of
Common Stock validly tendered (and not  properly withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest.

 


 

 

 

2  

(c) The Offer shall be made by  means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer
to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the  Offer Conditions. Unless
previously approved by the Company in writing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not: (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iii) change the number of shares of Common  Stock to

_Annex  I_ , (v) add any condition to the Offer or any term that is adverse
to the holders of Common Stock, (vi) extend the expiration of the Offer except
as required or permitted by this _Section 1.1_ , (vii) provide for a
"subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (viii) modify, supplement or amend any
other term or  condition of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of
Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right (but shall not
be obligated) at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, to
(A) increase the Offer  Price, and (B) waive (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) any Offer Condition and make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer, in each case, that are not inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement (including the  limitations set forth in the
preceding sentence).

 


 

 

(d) Unless extended or terminated  in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. (New York
City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the
commencement of the Offer, as calculated in accordance with  Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
of the Exchange Act (such time and date, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or
if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance  with this
Agreement, on the date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Date, or such later time and date to which the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration
Date_ ").

 


 

 

(e) If as of any then scheduled  Expiration Date, any Offer Condition has not
been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement, waived by Parent or Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer  for successive periods of up to
five (5) Business Days each (or such longer period of up to twenty (20)
Business Days if Parent so desires and the Company consents in writing prior
to such extension) in order to permit the satisfaction of the  Offer
Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be  required
to extend the Offer beyond August 31, 2019 (such date, the " _Outside Date_
"), and shall not extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the 
Company's consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its staff or
NASDAQ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to
extend the  Offer beyond the Outside Date, and shall not extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date without the Company's consent.

 


 

 

(f) Merger Sub shall not  terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article  VII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) promptly terminate the Offer and shall not acquire the
shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Merger
Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the  Acceptance Time, Merger
Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to promptly return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered
shares of Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

(ii) cause a notice that  satisfies the requirements of Section 3-106.1(e)(1)

and

 


 

 

(v) cause the Offer Documents to  be disseminated to all holders of shares of
Common Stock as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including
the Exchange Act.

 


 

 

(h) The Schedule TO shall include  as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form

or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and (ii) cause the Offer

extent that any of them become aware that such information shall have become 
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and Parent and Merger Sub agree to cause the Offer Documents,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
shares of Common  Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by all
applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company, its stockholders and
the Company Subsidiaries that may  be reasonably requested in connection with
this _Section 1.1(h)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment  on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
reasonable consideration to any such comments made by the Company and its
counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall  provide the Company and
its counsel promptly with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the 
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
written or oral  responses to the SEC or its staff in respect of the Schedule
TO and Offer Documents and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments made by the Company and its counsel and
shall give the Company and its  counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the
SEC related thereto, to the extent such participation is not prohibited by the
SEC or applicable Law.

Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ")        that shall contain, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2_ , the Company Recommendation and the full text of
the opinion of the Company Financial Advisor  referred to in _Section 3.24_ ;
_provided_ that, the Company shall not be  deemed to be in violation of its
obligations set forth in this sentence if it has used reasonable efforts to
prepare the Schedule 14D-9 on an expeditious basis following the date of this
Agreement and is prepared to file with the SEC the  Schedule 14D-9 no later
than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement. The Company
agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Common Stock, as and to the extent required by all applicable  Laws,
including the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to use reasonable best efforts to (i)
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule  14D-9 and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9 when filed to comply with
applicable Law and promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that any of them become aware that
such information shall  have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of shares of Common  Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act.
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC,

provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel promptly with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with 
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any
written or oral responses thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any proposed
written or  oral responses to the SEC or its staff in respect of the Schedule
14D-9 and the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments
made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel, and shall give Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel a  reasonable opportunity to participate in any
substantive telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related
thereto, to the extent such participation is not prohibited by the SEC or
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the  obligations of the
Company in this _Section_ _1.2_ shall not apply from  and after the time the
Company Board effects a Company Change in Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 5.2_.

 


 

 

 

5  

 

(b) _Company Information_. From time to time as requested by Merger Sub or its
agents, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger
Sub mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting  beneficial
owner lists and any other listings or computer files available to it
containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial owners of the
shares of Common Stock, in each case, accurate and complete as of the most
recent  practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such
information (including, but not limited to, updated lists of holders of the
shares of Common Stock and their addresses, mailing labels, security position
listings and  non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance
as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the
record and beneficial holders of shares of Common Stock, in connection with
the preparation and  dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
and the solicitation of tenders of shares of Common Stock in the Offer. Except
as required by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity, Parent and Merger
Sub and their agents shall hold  in confidence the information contained in
any such labels, listings and files, will use such information only in
connection with such transactions and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
will, upon request, deliver, and will cause their  agents to deliver, to the
Company (or destroy, and confirm such destruction to the Company) all copies
of such information then in their possession or control.

 


 

 

(c) _Acceptance Time_. The Company shall cause the transfer of shares of
Common Stock accepted for payment to be registered by its transfer agent
effective immediately after the time at which Merger Sub accepts for payment
and  purchases shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , that Merger Sub causes the
Paying Agent to pay  for such shares of Common Stock at or immediately after
such acceptance.

 


 

 

1.3 _The     Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon  cease. The Company shall be the surviving company in the
Merger (hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Company_ "), and the
separate corporate existence  of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The
Merger shall have the effects  specified in the MGCL.

 


 

 

 

6  

1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth  Avenue, New
York, New York 10153, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Acceptance Time, and in no event later than two (2) Business Days, following
the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of each of the conditions
set  forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those  conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement or (b) at such other place and time and/or on such other date
as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree in writing; _provided_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Closing shall in any event not occur earlier
than thirty (30) days following the date of dissemination of the Maryland
Short Form Notice  as provided in this Agreement (the date on which the
Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

 


 

 

1.5 _Effective     Time_. Contemporaneously with the Closing, the Company
and Parent will cause articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Articles of Merger_ ")     to be executed, acknowledged and filed with
the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the "
_Department_ ") as provided in the MGCL. The  Merger shall become effective
at the time when the Articles of Merger have been accepted for record by the

of any securities of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 


 

 

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities; Subsidiary-Owned Securities_.

 


 

 

(i) Each share of Common Stock  held by the Company as treasury stock or held
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange  therefor or in

to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled or converted  pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_ hereof) shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
The holders of certificates or book-entry shares which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented such Common Stock  (respectively, the "
_Certificates_ " and " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease  to have any rights
with respect to such Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon

reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of (i) the Offer Price
as provided in _Section 1.1(b)_   and (ii) the applicable Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_. Prior to the Acceptance Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited  with the Paying Agent, cash
constituting an amount sufficient to make payment of (x) the aggregate Offer
Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ and (y)  the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ (all cash deposited with
the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At or immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Surviving Company
(taking into account the available cash of the Surviving  Company and its
Subsidiaries), and the Surviving Company shall disburse in cash, the amounts

deficiency in the amount required to make such payments. The Paying Agent
shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of
Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments  pursuant to
_Section 1.1(b)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof. The Exchange  Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_

(b) As promptly as practicable  following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than three (3) Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Company shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time  represented outstanding shares of
Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or  affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates  (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration
into which the number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

(c) Upon surrender of a  Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be  required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, promptly following the  later to
occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent's receipt and
acceptance of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered shall be
forthwith  canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with such reasonable terms
and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) on the  Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof). If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is  registered, it will be a
condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such payment will have paid any transfer or  similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or will
have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes
either  have been paid or are not payable.

 


 

 

 

9  

(d) Promptly after the Effective  Time and in any event not later than two
(2) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall issue
and deliver to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of Book-Entry
Shares, which have converted into the right to  receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , an amount in
cash, equal to the product of (A) the Offer Price and (B) the  number of such
Book-Entry Shares held by such record holder, without such holder of Book-
Entry Shares being required to deliver a Certificate or executed letter of
transmittal. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of  the Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable to such holder.

 


 

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest accrued with respect thereto) which remains
undistributed for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the  Surviving Company, upon demand, and any holders of Shares
as of the Effective Time who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
II_ shall thereafter  look only to the Surviving Company as general creditor
thereof for payment of their claims for cash, without interest, to which such
holders may be entitled upon compliance with this _Article II_.

 


 

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public 
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental  Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of
the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 


 

 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article      II_ , (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and
(iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with  maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-l or P-l
or better by Moody's Investors  Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments
will become a part of the Exchange Fund.

2.3 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement and other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any
time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the  Effective
Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split

during such period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions

or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Acquisition  Proposal, (y) promptly terminate access by any such Person to
any physical or electronic data rooms, and any other access to non-public
information or data of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, made
available by the Company, the  Company Subsidiaries or their Representatives
and (z) promptly instruct each Person that has previously executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with such Person's consideration of a
Company Acquisition Proposal to return to the  Company or destroy any non-
public information previously furnished to such Person or any of such Person's
Representatives by or on behalf of the Company. Without limiting the
foregoing, any breach of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.2_ by
any Affiliate or Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the Company.

 


 

 

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section 5.2(a)_ , from and after the  date of
this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , the  Company
may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal which did not result from a breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ and so  long
as it has provided prior written notice to Parent in accordance with _Section
5.2(c)_ , (i) provide access to non-public information regarding the  Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Company
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such information has previously been 
made available to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrently
with the making of such information available to such Person and that, prior
to furnishing any such material non-public information, the Company receives
from the  Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material
respects on such Person as the Confidentiality Agreement's terms are on Parent
(it being understood  that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit
the making or amending of a Company Acquisition Proposal), and (ii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding
such Company Acquisition  Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking any
action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation  that (A) such Company
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and (B) the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be  inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary or similar duties under applicable Law. The
Company shall enforce any preexisting explicit or implicit confidentiality or
standstill provisions or similar agreements with any Person or group of 
Persons, unless the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
determines in good faith that any failure to do so would be reasonably be
expected to be  inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary or similar duties
under applicable Law.

(c) _Notice_. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-
four (24) hours) notify Parent in writing (with notice by email being
sufficient, regardless of time of day or transmission on a non-Business  Day,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.6_ ) if (i) any written
or other inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or that  could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal are received
by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective 
Representatives, (ii) any non-public information is requested in connection
with any Company Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal) from
the  Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
Representatives, or (iii) any discussions or negotiation with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal (or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to  lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal) are sought
to be initiated or continued with the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
of their respective Representatives, in each case, (x) indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of  such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers and (y) attaching copies of any
materials, documents and correspondence related thereto, including any
proposed Company Alternative Acquisition Agreements and  any related
financing commitments, and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments or modifications thereto and updated copies of all  materials,
documents and correspondence related thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

46  

(f) _Company Change in Recommendation Provision Due to Superior Proposal_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_ , 
following receipt of a written Company Acquisition Proposal by the Company
after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of
_Section_ _5.2(a)_ and the Company Board determining in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal  counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, make a Company Change in
Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
7.3(b)_ to enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Company Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.2(f)(ii)_ ,
or  authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, if
and only if all of the following conditions are previously met:

 


 

 

(i) the Company shall have  (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days'
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
written Company Acquisition Proposal  that constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Company Acquisition
Proposal (including the form and amount of consideration offered therein and
the identity of the Person or group making the  Company Acquisition
Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the
Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents (other than
immaterial documents) related to the Company Superior Proposal  (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms (including
price) or any other material term or condition of such Company Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2) Business Day
period)  and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company Board has
determined to effect a Company Change in Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ in order to enter into the
Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to
making such a Company Change in Recommendation or terminating this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ , as applicable, (x) negotiated, and
directed its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent elects to  negotiate) during such notice period to consider
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be
proposed in writing by Parent such that the Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement ceases to constitute a Company  Superior Proposal, and (y) in
determining whether to make a Company Change in Recommendation and/or to
effect such a termination in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ ,  the Company
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent; and

 


 

 

(ii) the Company Board  shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that, (A) in light of such Company Superior Proposal
and taking into account any revised terms  proposed in writing by Parent,
such Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal and(B) the failure to make such Company Change in Recommendation or
to so terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.3(b)_ , as
applicable, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary or similar  duties under applicable Law.

 


 

 

(g) _Company Change in Recommendation Due to Company Intervening Event_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_ , 
upon the occurrence of any Company Intervening Event, the Company Board may,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, take any action that is otherwise 
prohibited by clause (i)(A) or clause (i)(C) of the definition of Company
Change in Recommendation, which action would constitute a Company Change in
Recommendation, if and only if all of the following conditions are previously
met:

 


 

 

 

47  

(i) the Company shall have  (A) provided to Parent four (4) Business Days'
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Company  Intervening Event and the rationale for
the Company Change in Recommendation, and (2) state expressly that, subject to
clause (ii) below, the Company Board has determined to effect a Company Change
in Recommendation, and (B) prior to making  such a Company Change in
Recommendation, negotiated, and directed its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent elects to negotiate) during such
four (4) Business Day period to consider revisions to the  terms and
conditions of this Agreement which may be proposed in writing by Parent so
that a Company Change in Recommendation would no longer be necessary; and

 


 

 

(ii) the Company Board  shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that in light of such Company Intervening Event and
taking into account any revised terms  proposed in writing by Parent, the
failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors'  fiduciary or similar duties
under applicable Law.

 


 

 

(h) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with  its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a
Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that any "stop look and  listen"
communication to its stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act shall include an affirmative statement to the effect
that the Company Recommendation is affirmed or remains unchanged; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this _Section        5.2(h)_ shall not be deemed to
permit the Company or the Company Board to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation except in accordance with _Section  5.2(f)_ or _Section
5.2(g)_.

 


 

 

5.3 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

 


 

 

 

48  

 

(a) The Company and Parent  shall, subject to _Sections 5.2_ , cooperate with
each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use,
their respective reasonable  best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable
under this Agreement and applicable Laws and Judgments to consummate and make
effective the Offer and the Merger  and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, including (i) preparing and
filing all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other
filings (and in any event, by filing within  five (5) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement) the notifications, filings and other information
required to be filed under the HSR Act and to obtain as expeditiously as
possible all Consents, registrations, expirations of  waiting periods and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) satisfying
the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,  challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer and/or the Merger, (iv)
obtaining (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any Consent or any
exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent 
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Offer and the Merger,
(v) satisfying the conditions and obligations with respect to any Indebtedness
of the Company to the extent necessary to consummate the Merger, (vi)
submitting  any filings or notifications to the U.S. Department of State's
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls required under Section 122.4 of the
ITAR, and (vii) executing and delivering any reasonable additional instruments
necessary to  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees payable to any
Governmental Entity in  connection with clauses (i) and (vi).

 

 


 

 

(b) Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_ , in the event that the Parties receive a
request for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a "
_Second Request_ "), unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, the Parties
will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to,
and to certify compliance  with, such Second Request as promptly as
practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such Second Request review process. Neither Party shall agree
to extend any waiting period under the HSR  Act or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Entity to delay the transactions contemplated hereby
except with the prior written consent of the other Party. None of the Parties
shall knowingly take, cause or permit to be taken or  omit to take any action
which such Party reasonably expects is likely to materially delay or prevent
consummation of the contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by
the Parties.

 


 

 

(c) Parent and the Company  shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust
Laws and shall have joint decision making authority with respect to obtaining
the required Consents under the Antitrust Laws and otherwise hereunder,
including pursuant to this _Section 5.3_. No Party or its counsel shall
independently participate in any substantive call or meeting relating to the
Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, 
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other Party or its counsel
prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. In
furtherance of  the foregoing and to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(i) each Party shall notify the other, as far in advance as practicable, of
any filing or material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of
its Subsidiaries intends to  make with any Governmental Entity relating to
the matters that are the subject of this _Section 5.3_ , (ii) prior to
submitting any such filing or making  any such communication or inquiry, such
Party shall provide the other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review, and shall consider in good faith the comments of the other Party in
connection with, any such filing,  communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly
following the submission of such filing or making such communication or
inquiry, provide the other Party with a copy of any such filing or, if in
written form, communication or inquiry and (iv)  consult with the other Party
in connection with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Offer and/or the
Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning  for, any
meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising the
foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and Parent each shall act
reasonably, in good faith and as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this _Section
5.3_ may be reasonably redacted (A) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company,  the Offer and the Merger, (B) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, (C) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns or (D) as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 


 

 

 

49  

 

(d) In furtherance and not in  limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 5.3_ , each of the Parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve  such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Applicable
Antitrust Laws and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any
decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining  order or other
order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
purposes of this _Section 5.3(d)_ , "reasonable best efforts" shall mean
taking any and all actions necessary to obtain the Consents or waiting period
expirations of any Governmental Entity in connection with the Applicable 
Antitrust Laws required to consummate the Offer and the Merger prior to the
Outside Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting
and agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale,  divestiture, license, hold separate, and other disposition of the
businesses, assets, products or equity interests of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' other businesses,
assets, products  or equity interests now owned or hereafter acquired by
Parent, (ii) creating, terminating, or amending any existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, (iii)  otherwise taking or committing to any action
that would limit Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, products or
equity interests of Parent or the  Company (including any of their respective
Subsidiaries) and (iv) making, or causing any Subsidiaries to make, any
commitment, or committing to (or causing any Subsidiaries to commit to) make
any commitment (to any Governmental Entity in  connection with the Applicable
Antitrust Laws) regarding the future operations of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) (the "
_Regulatory        Actions_ "). Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall
require Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree
to take any  action with respect to its business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. The
Parties shall jointly control the process and strategy for pursuing any such
Regulatory Actions.

 


 

 

(e) In furtherance and not in  limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 5.3_ , if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any  proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Offer and/or the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Law, each of the Company and Parent  shall use reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is  in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer and/or the Merger.

 


 

 

(f) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other  matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Offer
Documents and any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or
on  behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

50  

(g) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with  copies of
notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer and the Merger and the 
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial
communications.

 


 

 

5.4 _Access; Consultation_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of the Company Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and Parent's 
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to the Company's, and each of the Company
Subsidiaries' employees, properties, assets, books, records and contracts and,
during  such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its or
any of its Subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, capital stock, business and
personnel as may  reasonably be requested by Parent or Parent's
Representatives, including using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Parent and its Representatives in connection with the provision of
customary information regarding the Company  and the Company Subsidiaries as
reasonably requested by Parent to the extent required by its bank credit
facilities (subject to the confidentiality provisions contained therein) for
delivery of certificates and information relating to  acquisitions;
_provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4_   shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company; and _provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing shall not  require the
Company to permit any invasive environmental sampling or to disclose any
information pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ to the extent that in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Company (after consultation with
outside  counsel) (i) any applicable Law requires the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, the
information is subject to  confidentiality obligations to a third party or
(iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ ,  _further_ that with respect to
clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section 5.4(a)_ , the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1)  obtain the required consent of any
such third party to provide such inspection or disclosure, (2) develop an
alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and (3) in the case  of clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to reasonably remove the basis for
the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean  room
procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with
respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine that
doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without 
violating applicable Law or confidentiality obligations or jeopardizing such
privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be 
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the Company. All requests for information made pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company,
or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer.

 


 

 

 

51  

(b) The Company, as it deems  advisable and necessary, may reasonably
designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside
Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such material and the
information contained therein shall be given  only to the legal counsel of
Parent, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to any
additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the Parties. All
information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the information or
material furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine  or any other applicable privilege
concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the Parties understand and agree that they have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is their  desire, intention
and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to,
and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such
material or its continued protection under the attorney-client  privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information that
is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such 
protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense
doctrine.

 


 

 

(c) Each of the Company and  Parent shall give prompt notice to one another
of any Effect that would reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), or of any
reasonably likely failure of any  condition to Parent's or the Company's
obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable).

 


 

 

5.5 _Stock Exchange De-listing and De-registration_. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to permit the Shares and any other security issued by
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and listed on NASDAQ to be  de-listed
from NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as possible
following the Effective Time.

 


 

 

5.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the entry into this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent shall  consult
with each other and obtain the other Party's written consent prior to issuing
or making, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect to 
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including internal announcements to employees of the Company) and any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities  exchange) with respect thereto, and shall incorporate any
comments reasonably proposed by the other Party, except (a) as may be required
by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national  securities exchange (in which case the disclosing
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other Party
reasonable time to review and comment thereon and shall incorporate any
comments reasonably proposed), (b) any press  release or public statement
that in the good faith judgment of the applicable Party is consistent with
prior press releases issued or public statements made in compliance with this
_Section 5.6_ or (c) with respect to any Company Change in Recommendation made
in accordance with this Agreement or Parent's  response thereto.

 


 

 

 

52  

5.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent agrees that each  employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
who continues to remain employed with the Company or its Affiliates following
the Effective Time (a " _Continuing  Employee_ ") shall, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of
the Effective Time (the " _Continuation        Period_ "), be provided
with (i) an annual rate of base salary or base wage that is no less favorable
than the base salary or base wages provided to such Continuing Employee by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries  immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than the target annual cash bonus opportunities provided to
such Continuing Employee by the Company and the  Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, (iii) to the extent such
Continuing Employee was provided a long-term incentive opportunity in the
Company's 2019 fiscal year, a long-term incentive opportunity in Parent's 
fiscal year 2020 with a grant date fair value that is consistent with the
guidelines set forth on _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.  
Parent agrees that Continuing Employees shall, during the Continuation Period,
be provided with retirement, welfare and other employee benefits (excluding
long term incentive opportunities) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate  to those provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(b) Parent shall provide or  shall cause to be provided the severance
payments and benefits set forth on _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter to any Continuing Employee  who is laid off, made redundant or whose
employment is otherwise involuntarily terminated without cause during the
twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date (the " _Involuntarily
Terminated Employees_ "), except with respect to Involuntarily Terminated
Employees who have individualized agreements with the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, in which case the terms of such agreements  shall remain in
force. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Involuntarily Terminated Employee
(other than those who are party to the aforementioned individualized
agreements) shall receive the severance payments and benefits set forth in
the  severance plans and arrangements of Parent or its Affiliates in which
such Involuntarily Terminated Employee is eligible to participate following
the Closing Date (the " _Parent Severance_ ") in lieu of such Involuntarily
Terminated Employee's severance entitlements set forth in the previous
sentence (the " _Company        Severance_ ") if the Company Severance
is less favorable in the aggregate than the Parent Severance.

 


 

 

(c) In the event that the  Closing Date occurs in 2019, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay to (1) each Continuing Employee who
remains employed with Parent, the Surviving Company or their respective
Affiliates through September 30, 2019 and  (2) each Involuntarily Terminated
Employee who terminates employment on or before September 30, 2019 (the "
_Terminated Employees_ "), a bonus for the 2019  performance period (the "
_2019 Annual Bonus_ ") that is equal to the 2019 Annual Bonus that such
Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive  under the Company
Plans based on the Continuing Employee's actual performance as determined
reasonably and in good faith by Parent and prorated to reflect the  portion
of the 2019 performance period through September 30, 2019; _provided_ that,
for each Terminated Employee, the 2019 Annual Bonus amount shall be prorated
to reflect the portion of the 2019 performance period until the date of  such
Terminated Employee's termination of employment; _provided_ , _further,_  
that the foregoing treatment upon termination of employment shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of a prorated
bonus amount provided to such Terminated Employee under the terms of the
applicable  Company Plan. The 2019 Annual Bonuses shall be paid at the same
time or times that Parent or the Surviving Company pay annual bonuses in
respect of the 2019 performance period to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries,  but in no event later than December 31, 2019.
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company to honor all Company Plans (other than those providing for long term
incentive opportunities), in accordance with  their terms, provided, that,
effective as of September 30, 2019, the Continuing Employees then
participating in the Company's annual cash bonus plan shall cease
participation therein, and such Continuing Employees shall thereafter
commence  participation in Parent's annual cash bonus plan.

 


 

 

 

53  

 

(d) Parent shall or shall  cause the Surviving Company or its Affiliates to
use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause its insurance carriers
to waive, all pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods that
could otherwise apply to any Continuing  Employee under the benefit plans
provided for such Continuing Employee following the Closing, except to the
extent such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods were applicable to the
Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With  respect to the plan
year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements paid prior to the Closing Date  in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
Parent plan in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate
following the Closing Date.

 


 

 

(e) From and after the  Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company or its Affiliates to provide credit to Continuing Employees
for their service recognized by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time for purposes of  eligibility, vesting, benefits,
continuous service, determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off,
and severance entitlements to the same extent and for the same purposes as
such service was credited under the Company Plans, _provided_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits.

 


 

 

(f) The then-current purchase  period under the ESPP (the " _Current Purchase
Period_ ") will end on June 28, 2019; _provided_ , that if the Effective Time
is prior to June 28, 2019, the Company will end the Current Purchase Period on
a specified trading day occurring at least ten (10) days prior to the date on
which the Effective  Time occurs; (ii) the Company shall cause each ESPP
participant's accumulated contributions under the ESPP to be used to purchase
Shares in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the Current Purchase
Period; and (iii) in all events, the  Company shall terminate the ESPP prior
to the Effective Time. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to limit any increase of any participant's
contribution rate in the ESPP and shall not  permit new employees to enroll
in the ESPP.

 


 

 

 

54  

(g) The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee, or any other employee
of the Company, Parent, the  Surviving Company or any respective Affiliate
thereof (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision
of this _Section 5.7_ shall create such rights in any such persons. Nothing
herein shall (i) create any right in any employee, including any Continuing
Employee to continued employment  by the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Company, or any respective Affiliate thereof or (ii) require the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Company, or any respective Affiliate thereof to continue
any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,  modification or termination of
any Company Plan after the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed  as an amendment to any
benefit plan of the Company, the Surviving Company or any respective
Affiliate.

expense.

 


 

 

5.9 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_. (a) For a period
of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless each  present and
former director and officer of the Company determined as of the Effective Time
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses  (including
reasonable and documented attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or 
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of the fact that such Indemnified
Party  is or was a director or officer of the Company, or is or was serving
at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another Person prior
to the Effective Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the  Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would
have been permitted under Maryland Law, any applicable indemnification
agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement (and made available to
Parent prior to the date of this  Agreement) to which such Person is a party,
the Company Charter or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement
to indemnify such Person (and Parent and the Surviving Company shall also
advance expenses as incurred in the defense  of any Proceedings with respect
to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ to
the fullest extent permitted under  applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately  determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification). In the event of any Proceeding pursuant to which
any Person may claim indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_ , (i)
the Surviving Company may (at its option) control the defense thereof and (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in such Proceeding without  the prior written consent of the
Surviving Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Parent shall ensure that the organizational documents of the
Surviving Company shall, for a period of six (6) years  from and after the
Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries than  are
presently set forth

 


 

 

 

55  

in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws. Any right of indemnification of an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights of such Indemnified Party as  provided herein.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to the Effective  Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of

carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance, employment practices liability insurance and  fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as the Company's existing  policies with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ that in no event shall the
Company expend for such policies an annual premium amount in  excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Company for any reason
fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective  Time, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of  this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement,
or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company
to,  purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend, or Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to expend for such policies, an annual amount in
excess of  three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by
the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the premium for such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage  available for a cost not exceeding such amount. If Parent
or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into
any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of  such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and  assigns of Parent shall assume all
of the obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 


 

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs
and their representatives. The  rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section 5.9_ shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have
under Maryland Law or, subject to  any limitations contained therein, any
applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a party in effect
on the date of this Agreement (and made available to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement), the Company Charter or  the Company Bylaws.

 


 

 

(d) Neither Parent nor the  Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual proceeding
for which

 


 

 

 

56  

indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an  unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such proceeding or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement,  compromise or consent.

 


 

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement  is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries  for any of their respective
directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior  to or in substitution for
any such claims under such policies.

 


 

 

5.10 _Takeover Statute_. The Company and the Company Board shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary or reasonably appropriate
to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or  regulation is

hereby. If any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the

to render such statute or regulation inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be  consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by

rights under _Section 5.1_.

 


 

 

5.12 _Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use

Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated  under the Exchange Act.

consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in

indebtedness.

writing and promptly after acquiring knowledge thereof, of any pending or
threatened Proceeding related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or 
the other transactions contemplated hereby that is brought against such Party,
its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors or officers and
shall keep the other Party reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
with  respect to the status thereof. The Parties agree to cooperate in the
defense and settlement of any such litigation, and the Company shall not
settle or enter into any negotiations for settlement of any such Proceeding
without the prior  written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting in any way the Parties'
obligations under _Section 5.3_ ,  each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or
settlement of any Proceeding contemplated by this _Section        5.14_
and the Company will give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the defense of, and consider in good faith Parent's advice with respect to,
such Proceeding.

permitted by Law, the Company (acting through the Company Board, its
compensation committee or its "independent directors" as defined by Rule 
5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules, to the extent required) will take all
such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding that has been or will be entered into by the Company or its

void and of no effect with no liability on the part of  any Party (or of any

Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly the amount due
pursuant to _Section 7.5_   (any such amount due, a " _Payment_ "), and, in
order to obtain such Payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the Company for the  applicable Payment, or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the Payment and the amount of such costs  and expenses at the prime
rate in effect on the date such Payment was required to be paid from such date
