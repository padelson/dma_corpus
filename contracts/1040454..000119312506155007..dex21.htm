requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its method of operation enabled it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code through its taxable year ending [December 31, 2005]; and </FONT></P> <P

Code during its taxable year beginning [January 1, 2006] through the Closing (without regard to REIT distribution requirements); provided that the Company&#146;s [2006] taxable year will not close on the Closing Date, and the Company&#146;s
qualification as a REIT for [2006] will depend, in part, upon its organization and method of operation post-Closing. As a result, in rendering this opinion, with your consent, we have assumed that following the Closing and through the end of the
Company&#146;s taxable year in which the Closing occurs, the Company will continue to be organized and operated in accordance with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. </FONT></P> <P

the facts from those set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Proxy Statement or Officer&#146;s Certificate may affect the conclusions stated herein. As described in the Proxy Statement, the Company&#146;s qualification and taxation as a REIT depends
upon its ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will
not be reviewed by Latham&nbsp;&amp; Watkins LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company&#146;s operation for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements. </FONT></P> <P
