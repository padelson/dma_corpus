deemed to have unconditionally and irrevocably waived any and all rights such
holder may have against the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives under the CTOP Partnership
Agreement or Pinecreek OP Partnership Agreement, respectively, in connection
with and with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, under any Tax Protection Agreements, or otherwise, (II)
when completed, specify the number of Company OP Units, if less than all, with
respect to which an Election is made (failing which, the holder thereof shall
be deemed to have made an Election with respect to all of such holders
Company OP Units), and (III) provide any other information or certification
relating to Taxes that is reasonably required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. In order to be effective, an Election Form
must be duly completed, signed and submitted to Parent, and must be received
by Parent by the date (the " _Election Deadline_ ") specified in the Election
Form or in the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.11(b). Any
holder of Company OP Units who has the right to make, and has made, an
Election pursuant to this Section 2.8(a) (each an " _Electing Holder_ ") may
at any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke such Election by written
notice to the Parent received by Parent prior to the Election Deadline. Any
Electing Holder who does not submit a properly completed Election Form which
is received by Parent prior to the Election Deadline, or who has duly revoked
such Election, shall be deemed not to have made an Election and shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. Parent shall, in its sole
discretion, determine whether an Election Form has been timely and properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial
defects in such form. Such decision shall be conclusive and binding.

(b) Each Company OP Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time with respect to which the holder thereof has the right to make,
and has duly made, an Election in accordance with Section 2.8(a), shall remain
a limited partnership interest of the Surviving CTOP Entity or the Surviving
Pinecreek Entity,  



 

13  respectively, and no payment shall be made pursuant to this Agreement with
respect thereto. In addition, Parent shall contribute cash and, if a
Stock Election is made, shares of Parent Common Stock, to CTOP Merger Sub or
Pinecreek Merger Sub (directly or indirectly through depositing the same with
the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 2.11) as needed to pay the
Merger Consideration to non-Electing Holders, and Partnership Units in the
Surviving CTOP Entity or the Surviving Pinecreek Entity shall be issued to
Parent in an amount equal to the number of non-Electing Holders Company OP
Units in CTOP and Pinecreek OP, respectively, cancelled pursuant to Section
2.8(a) (which Company OP Units shall be treated as having been sold to the
Parent by the non-Electing Holders for federal and applicable state income tax
purposes).

Section 2.9 _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Stock._

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of
the Merger, the Company and the Company Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) shall cause the vesting of each then outstanding Company Option to
be fully accelerated and shall cause each then outstanding Company Option to
be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and the holder to become
entitled to receive an amount of cash, if any, from the Company equal to
the product of (x) the excess, if any, of $70 over the exercise price per
share of such Company Option, and (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the unexercised portion of such Company Option (such amount
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option
Consideration shall be paid by the Company as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time. The Company shall withhold from the Option Consideration
any taxes required to be withheld.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the consummation
of the Mergers, the Company and Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall cause the vesting of each share of outstanding
restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans to be
fully accelerated and the contractual restrictions thereon to terminate.

(c) Each of the Parties shall take such steps, if any, as may be required to
provide that, with respect to each Section 16 Affiliate (as defined below),
(i) the transactions contemplated by this section, and (ii) any other
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) or
other acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement, shall be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action
Letter, dated January 12, 1999 (CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. 77.515). For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Section 16 Affiliate_ " shall mean each individual who
(x) immediately prior to the Effective Time is a director or officer of
the Company or (y) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company.

(d) The Company shall take all corporate actions necessary to effectuate the
treatment of Company Options and restricted Company Common Stock contemplated
by this Section 2.9 and to ensure that (i) all awards issued under the Company
Stock Plans shall be settled as of the Effective Time, and (ii) neither any
holder of Company Options and restricted Company Common Stock nor any other
participant in any Company Stock Plan shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or to receive any payment or benefit with
respect to any award previously granted under the Company Stock Plans except
as provided in this Section 2.9.

Section 2.10 _Fractional Interests_. If Stock Consideration is included in the
Merger Consideration, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and such
fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a
stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional interests, each
Company Stockholder exchanging Certificates pursuant to Section 2.7(a) and
Company OP Unit holder (other than an Electing Holder) who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of
record by such stockholder) shall receive cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the average of the last reported
sales prices of Parent Common Stock, as reported on the NYSE, on each of the
ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.



 

14 Section 2.11 _Surrender of Company Common Stock and Company OP Units; Transfer
Books._

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for Company Stockholders
and Company OP Unit holders (other than any Electing Holders) in connection
with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall receive
the Merger Consideration to which Company Stockholders and Company OP Unit
holders (other than any Electing Holders) shall become entitled pursuant to
Sections 2.7(a) and 2.8(a), respectively. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
will make available to the Exchange Agent cash in respect of the Cash
Consideration, sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of the
Stock Consideration, if any, and an estimated amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, to make all exchanges pursuant to Section 2.11(b)
and 2.11(c). The Exchange Agent shall cause the cash, shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in
lieu of fractional shares, if any, deposited by Parent to be (i) held for the
benefit of Company Stockholders and Company OP Unit holders (other than any
Electing Holders) and (ii) promptly applied to making the exchanges and
payments provided for in Sections 2.11(b) and 2.11(c). Such cash, shares of
Parent Common Stock, dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash
in lieu of fractional shares shall not be used for any purpose that is not
provided for herein.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to, mail to each Company Stockholder whose shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10. Upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, after giving effect to any required Tax witholding
pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof (i) cash in respect of the Cash Consideration
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.7(a), (ii) a certificate in respect of the Stock Consideration
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.7(a), with respect to each Certificate formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock, (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.10, (iv)
any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.11(h) in each case without interest, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled and (v) any unpaid dividend declared
by the Company in respect of Company Common Stock in accordance with Sections
5.1, 5.3, 6.13 or 6.14, in each case without interest. Until so surrendered
and exchanged, each Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive
the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock it
theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a),
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10, any dividends
or distributions pursuant to Section 2.11(h) and any unpaid dividend declared
by the Company in respect of Company Common Stock in accordance with Sections
5.1, 5.3, 6.13 or 6.14, in each case without interest. If the payment of cash
in respect of the Cash Consideration or the exchange of certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of the Stock
Consideration, if any, is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such exchange shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of cash or exchange of certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent
to, mail to each Company OP Unit holder (i) an Election Form and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the delivery of outstanding certificates, if
any, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company OP
Units or other evidence of  



 

15  ownership of Company OP Units, if any (" _OP Unit Certificates_ ") in
exchange for the Merger Consideration and the cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.10 if such Company OP Unit holder is
not an Electing Holder. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Election
Form, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to
such instructions, and subject to and conditioned upon the Partnership
Mergers, the holder of such OP Unit Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor, after giving effect to any required Tax witholding
pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof (i) cash in respect of the Cash Consideration
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.8(a), (ii) a certificate in respect of the Stock Consideration
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.8(a), (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.10, and (iv) any dividends
or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.11(h)
in each case without interest.

(d) At any time after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent cash and
any other instruments (including certificates for shares of Parent Common
Stock) in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have
not been distributed to holders of Certificates or OP Unit Certificates.
Thereafter, each holder of an OP Unit Certificate or of a Certificate,
representing shares converted pursuant to Section 2.7(a), or 2.8(a), may
surrender such OP Unit Certificate or Certificate to Parent and (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) receive in
exchange therefor the consideration payable in respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.7(a), Section 2.8(a), Section 2.10, Section 2.11(h), Section 5.1,
Section 5.3, Section 6.13 or Section 6.14, as applicable, in each case without
interest, but shall have no greater rights against Parent than may be accorded
to general creditors of Parent under applicable law in respect of the Stock
Consideration. If any OP Unit Certificates or Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any stockholder of the Company (or Company Stockholder) or any
Company OP Unit holder for any part of the Merger Consideration that has been
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law.

(f) At the CTOP Effective Time, the transfer books of CTOP shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
interests in CTOP on the records of CTOP. From and after the CTOP Effective
Time, former holders of Company OP Units in CTOP outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company OP Units, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
law.

(g) At the Pinecreek Effective Time, the transfer books of Pinecreek OP shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of interests in Pinecreek OP on the records of Pinecreek OP. From and after
the Pinecreek Effective Time, former holders of Company OP Units in Pinecreek
OP outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Pinecreek OP Units, except as otherwise provided
for herein or by applicable law. 

(h) No dividends or other distributions declared or paid after the Effective
Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or to any Company OP Unit  



 

16  holder who has failed to surrender their OP Unit Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Person is entitled, if any,
and no Merger Consideration, or any cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.10, shall be paid to such holder until the holder of
such Certificate or OP Unit Certificate surrenders such Certificate or OP Unit
Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon such
surrender or submission, Parent shall cause to be paid to the Person in whose
name the certificates representing the Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
respect of such surrendered Certificate or OP Unit Certificate, any dividends
or distributions with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such Person is entitled, if any, which have a record date after the Effective
Time and shall have become payable between the Effective Time and the time of
such surrender and any unpaid dividends declared by the Company in respect of
Company Common Stock in accordance with Sections 5.1, 5.3, 6.13 or 6.14, in
each case without interest. In no event shall the Person entitled to receive
such dividends or distributions be entitled to receive interest thereon.

Section 2.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any
Certificates or OP Unit Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates or OP Unit Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such cash in respect of the Cash
Consideration, shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) in respect of the Stock
Consideration, if any, and dividends or distributions, if any, as may be
required to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.7(a), Section 2.10 and
Section 2.11(h), Section 5.1, Section 5.3, Section 6.13 and Section 6.14;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates or OP Unit Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
or OP Unit Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.13 _Withholding Rights._ Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, or cash
in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or dividends or distributions, if any,
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any stockholder of the Company
or Company OP Unit holder such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Company Stockholder or Company OP Unit Holder, as the
case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.

Section 2.14 _Inclusion of Adjustment to Merger Consideration._ (a) Parent
shall be entitled, by delivery to the Company of written notice at any time
prior to the date which is 15 days prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as hereinafter defined) (the date such notice is
delivered, " _Announcement Date_ "), to elect (the " _Stock Election_ ") to
include Stock Consideration as a part of the Merger Consideration and to
reduce the amount of the Cash Consideration, all in accordance with and as set
forth in the following and the definitions of the various terms set
forth below. In the event the Stock Election is made, and not revoked in
accordance with paragraph (c) below, the following adjustments shall be made:

(a) the Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount specified by Parent
pursuant to the notice of Stock Election (the " _Stock Election Amount_ ");
_provided_ , in no event shall the Stock Election Amount exceed $10; and

(b) the Stock Consideration shall be a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Stock Election Amount divided by the Parent Common Stock Value.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Announcement Date, Parent and the Company
shall issue a joint press release announcing Parents election, subject to
its right of revocation, to include Stock Consideration in the Merger
Consideration, the Cash Consideration and the Stock Election Amount, and as
soon as the Parent  



 

17  Common Stock Value is determinable, Parent and the Company shall issue a
joint press release announcing the amount of the Stock Consideration.

(d) Parent may revoke the Stock Election at any time, provided that no such
revocation may be made if such revocation would make it reasonably
necessary, based upon the advice of the Companys outside counsel, to delay
the Company Stockholders Meeting for more than 10 Business Days. Following any
such revocation, the Cash Consideration shall again be $70 and the Merger
Consideration shall not include any Stock Consideration. As soon as
practicable after any such revocation, Parent and the Company shall issue a
joint press release announcing such revocation.

Section 2.15 _Structure_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement otherwise
to the contrary and without limitation of Parents rights under Section 6.13,
the Company shall (i) if requested by Parent, cooperate with and agree to any
changes to the direction of any one or more of the Mergers so that another
party to the Merger survives (such cooperation shall include entering into
appropriate amendments to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
Exhibit A) and (ii) cooperate with Parent with respect to any other reasonable
changes requested by Parent regarding the structure of the transactions
contemplated herein; provided, however, such cooperation contemplated by this
clause (ii) shall not require the Company to enter into any amendments to this
Agreement or otherwise amend, modify or waive any provision of this Agreement
without the Companys prior written consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to minimize
the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

Third Partys right of first refusal or other similar right under, any note,
bond, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, lease, or permit, authorization,

Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
in compliance with all foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations
applicable to their operations or with respect to which compliance is a

failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice since January 1, 2003,
or has Knowledge of any written notice received by it at any time, asserting
a failure, or possible failure, to comply with any such law or regulation, the

otherwise to the reasonable satisfaction of the party sending the notice,
except for (A) matters being contested in good faith and set forth in Section
3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (B) such failures as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.8 _SEC Documents._

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC all reports, schedules, statements and
other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
since December 31, 2003 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As of
their respective dates, with respect to Company SEC Reports filed pursuant to
the Exchange Act, and as of their respective effective dates, as to Company
SEC Reports filed pursuant to the Securities Act, the Company SEC Reports and
any registration statements, reports, forms, proxy or information statements
and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC after the date of this
Agreement (i) complied, or, with respect to those not yet filed, will comply,
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, and (ii) did not, or, with respect to those not yet
filed, will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to make
any filing with the SEC.

(b) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity
and cash flows of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, in all material respects, the results of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein and, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act. 

(c) Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(d) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. The Company and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared
with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis (" _Internal Controls_ "). Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (x) has designed disclosure controls and procedures (within the
meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure
that material information relating to such entity and its Subsidiaries is
made known to the management of such entity by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit
committee of its Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of Internal Controls which could adversely affect its
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
disclosed to its auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in its Internal Controls.

Section 3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes._ Except for the transactions
expressly contemplated hereby or disclosed in this Agreement, from January 1,
2006, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses substantially in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past
practices, and there has not been any change in the Companys business,
operations, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, Assets
or liabilities, except for changes contemplated hereby or changes which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries taken any action that they would not be permitted to take
pursuant to Section 5.1(a), Section 5.1(c), Section 5.1(d), Section 5.1(j),
Section 5.1(k), Section 5.1(l), Section 5.1(m), Section 5.1(r), Section

Disclosure Schedule, there is no Action (i) instituted, (ii) pending and
served upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) to the Knowledge
of the Company, pending and not served upon the Company or its Subsidiaries,
or threatened, in each case against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Assets which, individually or in the aggregate,
directly or indirectly, would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any outstanding judgment, decree or
injunction, in each case against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Assets or any statute, rule or order of any Governmental
Entity applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

22 Section 3.11 _Taxes._

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have (i) duly filed (or there have been
filed on their behalf) with the appropriate taxing authority all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them (after giving effect to any filing extension
properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so), and such
Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects, (ii) duly
paid in full, or made adequate provision (or there has been paid or provision
has been made on their behalf) for, all Taxes required to be paid by them,
whether or not shown to be due on such Tax Returns (excluding any provision or

authority with respect to any Taxes.

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each year
for which an extension to file Tax Returns has been requested and for which
such Tax Returns have not yet been filed.

(e) There are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon any Assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, except for Permitted Encumbrances, and no written power
of attorney that has been granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
currently is in force with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there are no, and at the Closing Date there will be no, Tax allocation or
sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and, after the Closing Date, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound by any such Tax allocation
or sharing agreements or similar arrangements or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than
a group the common parent of which was the Company) or (ii) has any liability

Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since the Companys taxable year ended December 31, 1997, the
Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes under Section 857(b), 860(c)
or 4981 of the Code (without regard to the amount of the Companys
distributions with respect to its income in the year that includes the
Effective Time), and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of
business. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon the
Company or its Subsidiaries. 



 

23 (i) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with its taxable year
ended December 31, 1997 through its taxable year ended December 31
immediately prior to the Effective Time, has elected and has been subject to
federal and state taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT, and has so qualified, for federal and state Tax purposes
for such years, (ii) at all times since such date, has operated in such a
manner so as to qualify as a REIT for federal and state Tax purposes and will
continue to operate (in each case, without regard to the REIT distribution
requirements in the year that includes the Effective Time) through the
Effective Time in such a manner so as to so qualify for the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Companys taxable year
will not close on the Closing Date, and the Companys qualification as a REIT
for the year that includes the Effective Time will depend, in part, upon its
organization and method of operation post-Closing, (iii) has not taken or
omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge by the IRS or any other taxing authority to its status as a REIT,
and no such challenge is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened.
Each Subsidiary of the Company that is a state law partnership or limited
liability company has been since its formation and continues to be treated for
federal and state income Tax purposes as a partnership (or a disregarded
entity) and not as a corporation or an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation. Each other Subsidiary of the Company has
been and continues to be treated for federal and state income Tax purposes as
a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the
Code, or a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of
the Code. Section 3.11(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
Asset of the Company and each Company Subsidiary which would be subject to
rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code. With respect to each such Asset,
Section 3.11(i) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the amount of any
gain that could be subject to Tax pursuant to such rules, based on the
estimate of value of such Asset at the relevant date that a determination
thereof is required to be made under such rules and (ii) the date after which
such gain will no longer be subject to Tax pursuant to such rules. 

(j) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has participated in any "reportable
transaction" or "listed transaction" as such terms are defined in Treasury
Regulations issued under the Code.

(k) The Company does not have any earnings and profits attributable to the
Company or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code.

(l) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(l) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (i) there are no Tax Protection Agreements currently in force, and
no person has raised, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened to raise,
a material claim against the Company or any Subsidiary for any breach of any
Tax Protection Agreement and (ii) none of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will give rise to any liability or obligation to make any
payment under any Tax Protection Agreement.

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to
the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(n) The aggregate basis of the assets held, directly or indirectly, by the
Company and its Subsidiaries exceeds the aggregate amount of the liabilities
to which such assets are subject and all other direct and indirect liabilities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all as determined for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

Section 3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans._

(a) The Company has listed in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule all Benefit Arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(together, the " _Company Employee Plans_ "). Section 3.12(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company Employee Plan that is
intended to be a "qualified plan"  



 

24  within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Plans_ ").
The Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been
revoked, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred that could adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the related trust.

(b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent, a true and correct copy of (i) the most recent annual report (Form
5500) filed with the IRS, (ii) such Company Employee Plan, (iii) each trust
agreement and group annuity contract, if any, relating to such Company
Employee Plan, (iv) the current summary plan description and summaries of any
material modifications thereto, if any, and (v) the most recent actuarial
valuation relating to a Company Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(c) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, no event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
the Company could be subject to any liability (other than liability for the
payment of benefits) that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable law. There is no Company Employee Plan that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA or is a Multiemployer Plan, nor has the Company or any of
its current or former ERISA Affiliates within the past six years participated
in or contributed to any Multiemployer Plan or any plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. The Company and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health,
medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

(d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, individually and in the
aggregate, there are no funded benefit obligations for which contributions
have not been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit
obligations which have not been accrued or otherwise properly disclosed in the
footnotes in accordance with GAAP, in the financial statements of the Company,
which obligations would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except as provided in this agreement or as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the
accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer, consultant or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the
right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Company Employee Plan or a related
trust. No amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form
of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
and the Company represents that the analysis prepared by the Companys
advisors and provided to Parent of whether any such amounts would constitute
"excess parachute payments," as well as the underlying data utilized in
such analysis, is complete and accurate in all respects except where any such
inaccuracies would not materially impact the results of such analysis.

(f) The aggregate amount of (i) severance payable under the Pan Pacific Retail
Properties, Inc. Severance Plan if all eligible employees were terminated and
entitled to benefits under such plan, (ii) bonuses payable pursuant to the
discretionary bonus pool disclosed on Section 5.1(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (iii) amounts payable pursuant to the contract disclosed on
Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, will not exceed $3,000,000.

Company Leased Property, sufficient to allow each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to conduct their business as and where currently conducted.

Permitted Encumbrances.

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

Property or to permit the lawful use and operation of all driveways, roads,

reclassification or other similar action relating to a Company Real Property

would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2003, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the Company or any such
Subsidiaries to the effect that (i) any condemnation or rezoning proceedings

violated by the maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other
improvements on any Company Real Property or by the maintenance, operation or

Section 5.2 _Conduct of Business of Parent Pending the Merger._ To the extent
that Parent has made and not revoked a Stock Election, during the period from
the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination
of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent agrees as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, except to the extent that the Company shall otherwise consent
in writing, as otherwise contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or as
required by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, not to:

(a) adopt or effect a plan of complete or partial liquidation or dissolution;

(b) amend, modify or repeal, or propose to do, or permit or consent any

treated differently than other holders of Parent Common Stock;

(c) take any action, or fail to take any action, which would reasonably be
expected to cause Parent to fail to qualify as a REIT; or

(d) take, undertake, incur, authorize, commit or agree to take any of the

Section 5.3 _Continued Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust; Final
Company Dividend._ From and after the date hereof through the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent will maintain its qualification as a "real
estate investment trust" under the Code and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Without limiting the  



 

37  generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, if necessary to enable the Company to make
aggregate dividend distributions (after taking into account any distributions
made or to be made by the Company pursuant to Sections 5.1(c) and 6.13 hereof)
during (a) its final taxable period as if it ended on the Closing Date, or (b)
its taxable year ended December 31 immediately prior to the taxable year that
includes the Closing Date, equal to the Minimum Distribution Dividend, the
Company shall declare and pay a dividend (a " _Final Company Dividend_ ") to
holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such shortfall. For purposes
of this paragraph, the term " _Minimum Distribution Dividend_ " shall mean a
distribution with respect to the applicable taxable period which is sufficient
to allow the Company to (i) satisfy the distribution requirements set forth
in Section 857(a) of the Code, and (ii) avoid, to the extent possible, the
imposition of income tax under Section 857(b) of the Code and the imposition
of excise tax under Section 4981 of the Code, determined, in each case, if
applicable, as if the taxable period that includes the Closing Date had ended
on the Closing Date. The Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of
the Final Company Dividend, if any, paid by the Company. For avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall be permitted to take net operating losses and/or
other available tax attributes into account in determining the amount of the
required Minimum Distribution Dividend, if any. 

Section 5.4 _Information._ The Company will advise Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable of (and, in the case of any written notice, provide to
Parent a copy of):

(i) the commencement of or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the threat of
any material claim, litigation, action, suit, inquiry or proceeding involving
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, their respective properties or assets,
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, involving any of their respective
directors, officers or agents (in their capacities as such);

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise),
business, Assets, liabilities, or long term profitability, any material
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty contained herein;

(iv) any and all material correspondence or material communications received
from any equity holder of any Operating Partnership;

(v) any material correspondence received from any tenant leasing more than
10,000 square feet of space, including any notice of default or request for
consent to assign or sublet;

(vi) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(vii) a copy of each material report, schedule, form, statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state,
provincial, local or otherwise) laws in connection with this transaction or
outside of the ordinary course of business.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

Section 6.1 _Preparation of Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Stockholder
Meeting._

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other regarding, and, prepare
and file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Parent shall
prepare and file the Registration Statement (in which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be  



 

38  included). The Company and Parent will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Registration Statement to comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
all reasonable efforts to have or cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
cleared by the SEC and to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall cause its respective
Representatives to fully cooperate with the other Party and its respective
Representatives in the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, and shall, upon request, furnish the other Party with
all information concerning it and its Affiliates as the other may
deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement. The Company
hereby agrees that the recommendations of the Company Board described in
Section 3.19 (subject to the right of the Company Board to withdraw, amend or
modify such recommendation in accordance with Section 6.3) shall be included
in the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under
any applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in connection with
the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, if any,
and will pay all filing fees incident thereto. As promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement becomes effective, the Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its stockholders.

(b) The Company and Parent each agrees that none of the information supplied
by it or its Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto,
will, on the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Company and Parent each agrees that none of the
information supplied by it or its Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time (i) the Company and Parent shall notify each other as promptly
as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should
be described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and (ii) the Company and
Parent shall each notify the other as promptly as practicable after the
receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the SEC on, or of any written
or oral request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and shall promptly supply
the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives and the SEC with respect to any of the foregoing filings.

(d) The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call the Company
Stockholders Meeting, to be held as promptly as practicable for the purpose of
voting upon the approval of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to the right
of the Company Board to withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation in
accordance with Section 6.3, the Company shall, through its board of
directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger and related matters, and the Company shall use its
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company
Voting Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) to timely call
and conduct the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal.

Section 6.2 _Cooperation; Notice; Cure._ Subject to compliance with applicable
law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall confer
on a regular and frequent basis with Parent and one or more of its
Representatives to report on the general status of ongoing operations. Each of
Parent and the Company  



 

39  shall promptly notify the other in writing of, and will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event, transaction
or circumstance, as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes known to
such Party, that causes or will cause any of its covenants or agreements under
this Agreement to be breached in any material respect or that renders or will
render untrue in any material respect any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement. No notice given pursuant to this
paragraph shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining
satisfaction of any condition contained herein.

Section 6.3 _No Solicitation._

(a) Subject to Section 6.3(b), unless and until this Agreement shall have been
terminated by either party pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall not,
directly or indirectly (through Representatives or otherwise): (i) solicit,
encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations, inquiries or
discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) disclose, in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, any information or provide access to
its properties, books or records, except as required by law or pursuant to a
governmental request for information; (iii) enter into or execute any
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) make or authorize any
public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal other than with respect to the Merger, or as otherwise required by
applicable law. This Section 6.3(a) shall not limit the ability of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to sell Assets in accordance with Section 5.1(f).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to a _bona fide_ , unsolicited,
written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party (that does not result from a
breach of this Section 6.3), the Company Board may, and may authorize
and permit the Companys Representatives to, (i) provide such Third Party
with nonpublic information, (ii) otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt by
a Third Party to make such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to or recommend
or endorse any such Acquisition Proposal, (iv) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its approval
and recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement, and (v) participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Third Party relating to such
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that (x) the Company Board
believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal if consummated would be a
Superior Proposal, (y) the Company Board, after having consulted with and
considered the advice of outside counsel, has reasonably determined in good
faith that failure to take such action would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company or the Company Stockholders under applicable
law, and (z) the Third Party has entered into a confidentiality agreement
pertaining to nonpublic information regarding the Company containing terms
in the aggregate no more favorable to the Third Party than those in the
Confidentiality Agreement (including the standstill provision thereof). In the
event the Company Board withdraws or modifies its approval of the Merger and
this Agreement as herein provided, the Merger and this Agreement shall
nevertheless be submitted to the Company Stockholders for their consideration
and approval in accordance with Section 3105(d) of the MGCL. For a period of
not less than five Business Days after Company delivers to Parent a Superior
Proposal Notice, the Company shall and shall cause its legal and financial
advisors to, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to
revise this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a
Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in determining whether an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal the Company must take into account any amendments to this Agreement
proposed by Parent. The Company shall not enter into any agreement
implementing an Acquisition Proposal prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent as soon as practicable (but in any event
within 24 hours) after receipt by an officer or director of the Company or by
any of the Companys advisors of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access
to the Companys properties, books or records by any person or entity
that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and
shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror and the terms
and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact and copies of any
proposed agreement relating thereto. If the Acquisition Proposal is determined
by the Company  



 

40  Board, in accordance with this Agreement, to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall contemporaneously furnish to Parent copies of any proposed
agreement relating thereto and all information it provides to the offeror and
contemporaneously notify Parent in writing of any oral or written changes to
the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt, any amendment to the financial or other terms of an Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) shall be treated as a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and shall require a new
Superior Proposal Notice if such new Acquisition Proposal is determined by
the Company to be a Superior Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside counsel that failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company or its
stockholders under any applicable law, _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof may, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.3 or required by Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal; provided further, that disclosure to stockholders pursuant to Rule
14e-2 relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
qualification, withdrawal or modification, of the Company Boards
recommendation of the Merger unless the Company Board expressly, and without
qualification, reaffirms its recommendation of the Merger in such disclosure.

(e) The Company agrees that it will (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Parent,
Merger Sub, CTOP Merger Sub and Pinecreek Merger Sub who have been furnished
with confidential information regarding the Company in connection with the
solicitation of or discussions regarding any Acquisition Proposal within the
12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such
information, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to enforce and not
waive any provision or release any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub, CTOP
Merger Sub and Pinecreek Merger Sub) from any confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees
that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or
entities referred to in the first sentence of Section 6.3(a) of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 6.3.

Section 6.4 _Access to Information._

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries will provide Parent and Parents counsel,
accountants and other representatives and agents with reasonable access, upon
prior notice and during normal business hours, to the facilities,
properties, officers, directors, employees, vendors, accountants, assets,
books and records of the Company and (i) Parent shall have the right, subject
to the terms of this Section 6.4, to prepare or cause to be prepared surveys,
inspections, engineering studies, environmental assessments and other tests,
examinations or studies with respect to the Company Properties; provided that
Parent indemnifies the Company for any losses, costs or damages associated
with any such items or caused during any period as a result of Parents
access, (ii) the Company shall provide Parent with a monthly review of the
unaudited revenues, capital spending and performance data of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries within 15 days after the end of each such month on a
property by property basis, and (iii) the Company will furnish Parent with
such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business, personnel and properties of the Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby as Parent shall from time to time reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that such investigation shall be conducted upon
reasonable prior notice, and in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the operation of the business of the Company; _provided further_ that
the Company shall provide reasonable assistance and cooperation to Parent in
connection with integration planning and transition activities and access to
employees as reasonably necessary in connection therewith; provided that such
access shall be coordinated with the Company and conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of the
Company.



 

41 (b) If the Parent has made a Stock Election, Parent and its Subsidiaries will
provide Company and Companys counsel, accountants and other representatives
and agents with reasonable access, upon prior notice and during normal
business hours, to books and records of Parent; _provided, however_ , that
such investigation shall be conducted upon reasonable prior notice, and in
such manner as not to interfere with the operation of the business of Parent.

Section 6.5  _Governmental Approvals._

(a) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, registrations, licenses, consents,
variances, exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of all Third
Parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Governmental Approvals_ "),
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental
Approvals. Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives and other Affiliates to, file within 30 days after the date
hereof, and in all events shall file within 60 days after the date hereof,
all required initial applications and documents in connection with obtaining
the Governmental Approvals and shall act reasonably and promptly thereafter in
responding to additional requests in connection therewith. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to Parent and the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders which appear in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company
(the " _Notifying Party_ ") will notify the other promptly of the receipt of
comments or requests from Governmental Entities relating to Governmental
Approvals, and will supply the other Party with copies of all correspondence
between the Notifying Party or any of its Representatives and Governmental
Entities with respect to Governmental Approvals. 

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any approval needed from a Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

Section 6.6 _Publicity._ Parent and the Company shall agree on the form
and content of the initial press release regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereafter shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or other public statement with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by law or obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or
rules of any national securities exchange. 

Section 6.7 _Affiliate Agreements._ No later than 45 days prior to the Closing
the Company shall deliver to Parent a list identifying, in the view of the
Company, each person who will be, at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, a Company Affiliate. The Company shall provide to Parent such
information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of
reviewing such list and shall notify Parent in writing regarding any change in
the identity of the Company Affiliates prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such Person identified to Parent shall be added to the
list of Company Affiliates if Parent shall receive from the Company, on or
before the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not a
Company Affiliate. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent as promptly as practicable but in
no event later than 15 days prior to the Closing an Affiliate Agreement, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, from each of its Affiliates.



 

42 Section 6.8 _Further Assurances and Actions._ Subject to the terms and
conditions herein, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) using their
respective reasonable efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Entities

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to fulfill all
conditions precedent applicable to such Party pursuant to this Agreement,

Company Board under Sections 6.3(b), 6.3(d) and 8.1(h).

reasonable efforts to list on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, to be
issued in the Merger.

Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause its
Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party
consents related to or required in connection with the Merger that are (i)
disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
or (ii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring
prior to or after the Effective Time.

Section 6.11  _Indemnification and Insurance._

time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an
officer, or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") which is at least as favorable to such persons as
the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time in their
respective Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date hereof;
provided, that such exculpation and indemnification covers actions on or prior
to the Effective Time, including all transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) In addition to the rights provided in Section 6.11(a) above, in the event
of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,

_Claims_ ") in which any Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any action or omission or alleged action
or omission by such Person in his capacity as an officer or director, or (ii)
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Company (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall from and after the
Effective Time jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Parties from and against any losses, claims, liabilities, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines or
amounts paid in settlement arising out of or relating to any such Claims.
Parent, the Surviving Company and the Indemnified Parties hereby agree to use
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the defense of such Claims.
In connection with any such Claim, the Indemnified Parties shall have the
right to select and retain one counsel, at the cost of the Indemnifying
Parties, subject to the consent of the Indemnifying Parties (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and more than one counsel if
the interests of such Indemnified Persons with respect to such Claim diverge
or could be reasonably expected to diverge. In addition, after the Effective
Time, in the event of any such threatened or actual Claim, the Indemnifying
Parties shall promptly pay and advance reasonable expenses and costs incurred
by each Indemnified Person as they become due and payable in advance of the
final disposition of the Claim to the fullest extent and in the manner
permitted by law.  



 

43  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be
obligated to advance any expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party, such undertaking to be accepted
without regard to the creditworthiness of the Indemnified Party, to repay any
expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified against such expense. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties
(i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in
a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable law. In the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a
court that any payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying Parties the amount
of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.11, upon learning
of any such Claim, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Parties of such
Claim and the relevant facts and circumstances with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not
affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to
defend such Claim; and _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no
Indemnified Party shall be obligated to provide any notification pursuant to
this Section 6.11(b) prior to the Effective Time. 

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those
persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount
no less favorable in the aggregate to the Companys directors and officers, as
the case may be, currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy
in effect on the date of this Agreement (provided that Parent may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous); _provided_ that, in satisfying
such obligation, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated
to pay premiums per annum in excess of 200% of the aggregate amount per annum
that the Company paid for such coverage in its last full fiscal year prior to
the date hereof, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the
date hereof;  _provided further_ that, in the event that the aggregate
premiums for maintaining such insurance for the benefit of the persons
currently covered by the Companys officers and directors insurance policy
under this Section 6.11(c) are in excess of 200% of the aggregate amount per
annum, then Parent shall only be obligated to maintain such insurance coverage
as is reasonably available for such amount.

(d) This Section 6.11 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their successors, assigns
and heirs and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent,
including the Surviving Company. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.11 and Parent
acknowledges and agrees that each Indemnified Party would suffer irreparable
harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants
and such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific
performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this Section 6.11.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of the
Company, the Surviving Company and Parent contained in this Section 6.11
shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Company.

Section 6.12  _Company Cooperation; Takeover Laws._

(a) The Company agrees to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, employees and advisors (including legal and
accounting advisors) to provide, all cooperation reasonably necessary in
connection with the arrangement of any financing or sales of assets to be
consummated contemporaneous with the Closing in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) participation in meetings, due
diligence sessions and road shows; (ii) reasonable assistance in connection
with  



 

44  Parents or its banks, underwriters, placement agents or other
representatives preparation of offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents; (iii) execution and delivery of
any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, and
other certificates (including solvency certificates), legal opinions
or documents as may be reasonably or customarily requested by the banks and
lenders; (iv) taking all necessary corporate action to consummate such
financing immediately prior to the Closing; and (v) using reasonable best
efforts to cause its independent accountants and counsel to provide
assistance to Parent, including providing consent, on a customary basis, to
Parent to use their audit reports relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
and, at the cost of Parent, to provide any necessary "comfort letters" and to
prepare and deliver other customary opinions and other deliverables. In
addition, in conjunction with the obtaining of any such financing, the Company
agrees, at the request of Parent, to call for prepayment or redemption, or to
prepay, redeem, defease and/or renegotiate, as the case may be, any then
existing indebtedness of the Company; _provided_ that any such prepayment,
redemption, defeasance or renegotiation shall be conditioned upon and shall
not actually be required to be made until at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
(i) use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) if
any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation be-comes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.13 _Asset Sales._ After the date hereof but prior to the Effective
Time, at Parents direction, the Company will enter into one or more Real
Estate Purchase Agreements (a " _Real Estate Purchase Agreement_ ") pursuant
to which Parent, a limited partnership or other entity to be formed by Parent,
or a third party (in each case, an " _Acquisition Vehicle_ "), would
purchase, and the Company and certain Subsidiaries would sell, certain real
estate assets and equity interests specified by the Real Estate Purchase
Agreement therein (the " _Asset Sales_ ") on the terms and subject to the
conditions specified by the Real Estate Purchase Agreement therein; _provided_
that (a) the Companys obligation to consummate any Asset Sales as
contemplated by this Section 6.13 shall be subject to the condition that (i)
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied,
(ii) that Parent has confirmed that Parent is prepared to proceed immediately
with the Closing, and (iii) that Parent shall have delivered to the Company
the certificate referred to in Section 7.2(d) and, if applicable, the opinion
referred to in Section 7.2(e); (b) concurrently with Parents delivery of the
certificate and opinion referred to in clause (a)(iii) of this proviso, the
Company shall deliver the certificate referred to in Section 7.3(c) and the
opinion referred to in Section 7.3(e) and the documents, agreements and
instruments referred to in this Section 6.13; (c) following the delivery by
Purchaser of the certificate and opinion referred to in clause (a)(iii) of
this proviso and the delivery by the Company of the items referred to in
clause (b) of this proviso, all conditions set forth in Section 7.3 shall be
deemed to have been satisfied or waived. The closing of the Asset Sales would
occur immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company agrees to take, or
cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
reasonable things as may be necessary to consummate and make the Asset Sales,
if any, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, including (i)
execution and delivery of Real Estate Purchase Agreements in form and
substance acceptable to the Parent, (ii) execution and delivery of such other
documents, agreements, deeds and instruments and taking such other actions as
may be reasonably requested by the Parent, and (iii) execution and delivery
of appropriate amendments to this Agreement to give effect to such Asset
Sales; provided that, in no event, shall the Company be obligated to incur
liability, pay costs or other monies or take any irrevocable action prior to
the time which is immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any indebtedness
of the Acquisition Vehicle to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with such Asset Sales shall be on arms length terms. Parent shall
ensure to the Companys reasonable satisfaction that any consideration
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any
Asset Sales consists of either cash or "real estate assets" within the meaning
of Section 856(c) of the Code and that any Asset Sales  



 

45  hereunder do not jeopardize the Companys status as a REIT. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare and pay a dividend
to holders of Company Common Stock in an amount equal to the net proceeds of
any Asset Sales, and the Cash Consideration will be reduced by the amount of
such dividend, if any.

Section 6.14 _Company REIT Status._ In furtherance and not in limitation of
Section 5.3, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
taking, and the Company hereby agrees to take, any action at any time or from
time to time that in the reasonable judgment of the Company Board, upon advice
of counsel, is legally necessary for the Company to maintain its qualification
as a REIT within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code for any period
or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if any such action causes the Company to distribute cash or
property to any holders of Company Common Stock or holders of Company OP
Units in addition to any distributions pursuant to Section 5.1(c), the Cash
Consideration will be reduced by the per share amount of any such
distribution. Subject to Section 2.15, after the Effective Time, the Company
will not be a qualified REIT subsidiary (within the meaning of Code Section
856(i)) of Parent, and will continue to be treated as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes, and the Companys taxable year will not close on
the Closing Date.

Section 6.15 _Parent REIT Status._ Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit
Parent from taking, and Parent hereby agrees to take, any action at any time
or from time to time that in the reasonable judgment of the Parent Board, upon
advice of counsel, is legally necessary for Parent to maintain its
qualification as a REIT within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code
for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time.

the earlier of (a) 30 days from Parent providing notice of such Terminating

condition of such termination, the Company shall comply with its obligations
under the terms of Section 8.2.

Section 8.2 _Expenses; Break-Up Fee._

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.2, all Expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses. As used  



 

49  in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a
party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing,
filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration
Statement and the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters
related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) an Acquisition Proposal has been
received by an officer or director of the Company or by the Companys
advisors or at the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly proposed or publicly announced and this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d) or (B) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company shall pay
the Expenses incurred by Parent up to the Maximum Expense Amount (as defined
below); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to
pay such Expenses incurred by Parent if it is obligated to pay a Break-Up Fee
pursuant to Section 8.2(c).

The " _Maximum Expense Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) $11,000,000 (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum amount, if
any, that can be paid to Parent, without causing it to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year
determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the Code ("
_Qualifying Income_ "), and (b) the recipient has $1,000,000 of income from
unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition
to any known or anticipated income which was not Qualifying Income), in each
case as determined by independent accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event Parent, receives a reasoned opinion from outside
counsel or a ruling from the IRS (" _Tax Guidance_ ") providing that Parents
receipt of the Maximum Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ "), the Maximum Expenses
Amount shall be an amount equal to the Maximum Amount and the Company shall,
upon receiving notice that Parent, as the case may be, has received the Tax
Guidance, pay to Parent the unpaid Maximum Amount within five Business Days.
In the event that Parent is not able to receive the full Maximum Amount due
to the above limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow
by wire transfer within three days of termination and shall not release any
portion thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives either one or a
combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from Parents
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
(calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which
events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Maximum Amount
or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above within
five Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof. The obligation
of the Company, as the case may be, to pay any unpaid portion of the Maximum
Expense Amount shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is
three years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after
the obligation of the Company to pay the Maximum Expense Amount terminates
shall be released to the Company. The Companys payment of the Expenses
incurred by Parent pursuant to this subsection shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent against the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or other
representatives with respect to the occurrences giving rise to such payment,
except for liabilities or damages caused by the willful breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements herein by the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section
8.1(d) or this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
and, in each case, an Acquisition Proposal has been received by an officer or
director of the Company or by the Companys advisors or at the time of such
termination an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly proposed or publicly
announced and within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries consummates a transaction included in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal (or enters into an agreement with respect
to  



 

50  such a transaction), then the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to
the Break-Up Fee less the amount of any Expenses which have been previously
paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent, within two
Business Days after the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) then
the Company shall pay Parent an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent,
within two Business Days after the termination of this Agreement.

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(h) then immediately prior to such termination, the Company shall pay
Parent an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.

The Companys payment of a Break-Up Fee or Expenses pursuant to Section 8.2
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent against the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, advisors or other representatives with respect to the occurrences
giving rise to such payment; provided that this limitation shall not apply in
the event of a willful breach of this Agreement by the Company. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay more than one Break-Up Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.2(c) and for the avoidance of doubt, the Break-Up Fee is the
maximum aggregate amount that the Company shall be required to pay Parent
pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) and 8.2(c), other than in each case with respect
to any willful breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(d) The " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
Base Amount (as defined below) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can
be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year determined as if (a) the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) Parent
has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Parent
which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent
accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent
receives Tax Guidance providing that Parents receipt of the Base
Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements, the Break-Up Fee
shall be an amount equal to the Base Amount and the Company shall, upon
receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to Parent the
unpaid Base Amount within five Business Days. In the event that Parent is not
able to receive the full Base Amount due to the above limitations, the Company
shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of
termination and shall not release any portion thereof to Parent unless and
until Parent receives either one or a combination of the following once or
more often: (i) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the REIT Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii)
the Tax Guidance, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent
the lesser of the unpaid Base Amount or the maximum amount stated in the
letter referred to in (i) above within five Business Days after the Company
has been notified thereof. The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be
compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the
difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances and neither Party
shall have any other liability to the other after the payment of the Break-Up
Fee. The obligation of Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee
shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is three years
from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the
obligation of the Company to pay the Break-Up Fee terminates shall be released
to the Company. As used in this Section 8.2(d), the " _Base Amount_ " shall
mean $65,000,000.

Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective officers,
members or directors except as (i) set forth in Section 8.2, (ii) with
respect to any actual liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party
as a result of the willful breach by the other party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements  



 

51  set forth in this Agreement, and (iii) with respect to provisions that
survive the termination hereof pursuant to Section 9.1.

Section 8.4 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards at any time before or
after any required approval of matters presented in connection with the Merger
by Company Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such
approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further
approval by such stockholders without the further approval of such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the Parties.

Section 8.5 _Waiver._ At any time prior to the Closing Date, any Party may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
Party or Parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any Party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

     | Re: | _Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Kimco Realty
Corporation, KRC Acquisition Inc., KRC CT Acquisition Limited Partnership, KRC
PC Acquisition Limited Partnership, Pan Pacific Retail Properties, Inc., CT
Operating Partnership and Western/Pinecreek, L.P., dated as of July 9, 2006_ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as tax counsel to Pan Pacific Retail Properties, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the proposed merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of KRC Acquisition Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _Merger
Sub_ ") and an indirect subsidiary of Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland
corporation ("Parent") with and into the Company pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger by and among Parent, Merger Sub, KRC CT Acquisition Limited
Partnership, KRC PC Acquisition Limited Partnership, Company P, CT Operating
Partnership and Western/Pinecreek, L.P., dated as of July 8, 2006 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "). This opinion is being rendered to you pursuant to
Section 7.3(e) of the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms employed but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Merger Agreement.

You have requested our opinion concerning the Companys election to be taxed
as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). This opinion is based on various
facts and assumptions, including the facts set forth in the Merger
Agreement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus filed by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on [Month] [day], 2006 (the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") concerning the business, assets and governing documents of the
Company and its subsidiaries. We have also been furnished with, and with your
consent have relied upon, certain representations made by the Company and its
subsidiaries with respect to certain factual matters through a certificate of
an officer of the Company (the " _Officer s Certificate_"). In addition, we
have obtained such additional information as we deemed relevant and necessary
through consultation with various officers and representatives of the Company
and Parent. With your permission, we have assumed the accuracy of the opinion
of Venable LLP, counsel for the Company, dated ) [Month] [day], [2006], with
respect to certain matters of Maryland law.

In our capacity as tax counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and
factual examinations and inquiries, including an examination of originals
or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such
documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary
or appropriate for purposes of this opinion. For purposes of our opinion, we
have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in
the above referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In addition,
in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all
representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge
or belief, without regard to such qualification. In our examination, we have
assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons
executing such documents and the conformity to authentic original documents of
all documents submitted to us as copies.

We are opining herein only as to the federal income tax laws of the United
States, and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto,
or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, the laws of any state or
other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any
other local agencies within any state. Based on such facts, assumptions and representations, it is our opinion that:

(a) Commencing with the Companys taxable year ending December 31, 1997, the
Company was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification
as a REIT under the Code, and its method of operation enabled it to meet the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code through
its taxable year ending [December 31, 2005]; and

(b) The Company has been organized and has operated in accordance with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code during
its taxable year beginning [January 1, 2006] through the Closing (without
regard to REIT distribution requirements); provided that the Companys [2006]
taxable year will not close on the Closing Date, and the
Companys qualification as a REIT for [2006] will depend, in part, upon its
organization and method of operation post-Closing. As a result, in rendering
this opinion, with your consent, we have assumed that following the Closing
and through the end of the Companys taxable year in which the Closing
occurs, the Company will continue to be organized and operated in accordance
with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.

No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed herein.

This opinion is rendered to you as of the date of this letter, and we
undertake no obligation to update this opinion subsequent to the date hereof.
This opinion is based on various statutory provisions,
regulations promulgated thereunder and interpretations thereof by the
Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters,
all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively.
Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the
Merger Agreement, the Proxy Statement or Officers Certificate may affect the
conclusions stated herein. As described in the Proxy Statement, the Companys
qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon its ability to meet the
various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual
annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels, and
diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not
be reviewed by Latham and Watkins LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given
that the actual results of the Companys operation for any particular taxable
year will satisfy such requirements.

This opinion is rendered only to you in connection with Section 7.3(e) of the
Merger Agreement, and is solely for your benefit. This opinion may not be
relied upon by you for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted to, or
relied upon by any other person, firm, or corporation, for any purpose,
without our prior written consent.

Very truly yours,

[DRAFT]
