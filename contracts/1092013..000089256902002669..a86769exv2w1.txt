            (a) Expect as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the

including, without limitation, accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses,
attributable thereto through the Valuation Date shall be for the account of

shall deliver to Seller a statement of any adjustments to Seller's estimate of
the apportionments, and Buyer shall pay to Seller, or Seller shall pay to Buyer,
as the case may be, pursuant to Section 3.7 any amount due as a result of the
adjustment (or, if there is any dispute, the undisputed amount). If Seller
disputes Buyer's determinations, or if at any time after delivery of Buyer's
statement of determinations, Buyer or Seller determine that any item included in
the apportionments is inaccurate, or that an additional item should be included
in the apportionments, the parties shall confer with regard to the matter and an
appropriate adjustment and payment shall be made as agreed upon by the parties
(or, if they are unable to resolve the matter within 15 days of Seller's receipt
of Buyer's statement of adjustments (the "Dispute Date"), they shall within 15
days of the Dispute Date mutually select a firm of independent certified public
accountants to resolve the items of disagreement alone, whose decision on the
matter shall be made within 30 days of their selection and shall be binding and
whose fees and expenses shall be borne by each of Seller and Buyer,
proportionately, in an amount equal the amount of such fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference (with such
difference being deemed in all cases hereunder to be a positive


                                       10
<PAGE>
number without regard to whether such difference is a positive or negative
amount) between the final determination of the independent accountant and the
final position taken by such party upon submission to the independent accountant
and the denominator of which is the difference between the Seller's and Buyer's
positions upon submission to the independent accountant. If the amount of Taxes
which are to be prorated pursuant to this Section is not known by forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date, then the amount of such Taxes will be
estimated as of such date and once the amount of such Taxes is known, Buyer
shall pay to Seller, or Seller shall pay to Buyer, as the case may be, the net
amount due as a result of the actual apportionment of such Taxes.

            (b) Consistent with Sections 6.16, 7.7 and 7.8 herein, all
intercompany obligations between the Company, on the one hand, and any ACME
Entity or its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, and any of
the other agreements referenced in such Sections or in the Schedules referenced
in such Sections shall, with respect to the Company and the Station, have been
cancelled prior to the Closing and shall not be taken into account in the
adjustments contemplated by this Section 3.6.

            SECTION 3.7. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. Promptly (but not later than
five business days) after the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 3.6 that is final and binding as set forth herein:

                  (i) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to
            Section 3.6 exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to
            Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
            accounts of Seller as Seller shall designate in writing to Buyer,
            the difference between the Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase
            Price; or

                  (ii) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to
            Section 3.6 is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall
            pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
            such bank accounts of Buyer as Buyer shall designate in writing to
            Seller, the difference between the Purchase Price and the Estimated
            Purchase Price.

            any ACME Entity is a party or any of the assets or properties of the
            Company or the Business is subject or by which the Company, with
            respect to the Business, any ACME Entity is bound, (C) any
            Governmental Permit, (D) any judgment, order, award or decree to

            is a party or any of the assets or properties or the Company or the
            Business is subject or by which the Company or, with respect to


                                       13
<PAGE>
            the Business, any ACME Entity is bound or (E) any statute, other law
            or regulatory provision affecting the Company or, with respect to
            the Business, any ACME Entity or the assets or properties of the
            Company or the Business, except, in the case of (B), (C) or (E), as
            would not have a Material Adverse Effect, provided that such
            conflict, breach, default or creation of any Encumbrance shall not
            prevent the consummation the transactions contemplated by this
            Agreement in accordance with its terms; or

                  (ii) require the approval, consent, authorization or act of,
            or the making by any ACME Entity or the Company of any declaration,
            filing or registration with, any third Person or any foreign,
            federal, state or local court, governmental or regulatory authority
            or body, except for such of the foregoing as are necessary pursuant
            to the HSR Act or the Communications Act.

            SECTION 4.4. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Schedule 4.4 contains (a) the
unaudited balance sheets of the Business as of December 31, 2001 and December
31, 2000, respectively, and the related statements of income for the years then
ended and (b) the unaudited balance sheet (the "Balance Sheet") of the Business
as of November 30, 2002 (the "Balance Sheet Date") and the related statements of
income and broadcast cash flows for the eleven months then ended. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.4, each of such balance sheets and statements of income and
broadcast cash flows have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied and present fairly and accurately, in
all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and
broadcast cash flows, as applicable, of the Business as of their respective
dates and for the respective periods covered thereby. None of such balance
sheets and statements or income or broadcast cash flows understate in any
material respect the normal and customary costs and expenses of conducting the
Business or operations of the Station or overstate in any material respect the
revenue generated by the Business and operations of the Station, in either case
as such Business or operations are currently conducted, or are otherwise
materially misleading regarding the operations of the Station. Except as
reflected in such balance sheets and statements of income and broadcast cash
flows or otherwise disclosed to Buyer in writing, no event has occurred since
the Balance Sheet Date that would make such balance sheets and statements of
income and broadcast cash flows misleading in any material respect.

            SECTION 4.5. OPERATIONS SINCE BALANCE SHEET DATE.

            (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.5(a), since the Balance Sheet
Date there has been, in respect of the Business or the Company:

                  (i) no change in the financial condition or the results of
            operations which has had a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (ii) no material damage, destruction, loss or claim (whether
            or not covered by insurance) or condemnation or other taking; and

                  (iii) no material adverse change in employee relations.



                                       14
<PAGE>
            (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.5(b), since the Balance Sheet
Date the operations of the Station and the Business have been conducted only in
the ordinary course and in conformity with past practice. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, since the Balance Sheet Date, except as set forth
in such Schedule, the Company has not:

                  (i) sold, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of
            (including any transfers from the Company to any ACME Entity or to
            any of their Affiliates), or mortgaged or pledged, or imposed or
            suffered to be imposed any Encumbrance (other than Permitted
            Encumbrances) on, any assets reflected on the Balance Sheet or any
            assets acquired after the Balance Sheet Date, other than personal
            property having a value, in the aggregate, of less than $50,000 sold
            or otherwise disposed of for fair value in the ordinary course of
            the Business consistent with past practice;

                  (ii) canceled any debts owed to or claims held by the Company
            (including the settlement of any claims or litigation) or waived any
            right of significant value to the Business other than in the
            ordinary course of the Business consistent with past practice;

                  (iii) created, incurred, guaranteed or assumed, or agreed to
            create, incur, guarantee or assume, any indebtedness for borrowed
            money (other than money borrowed or advances from any ACME Entity or
            any of their Affiliates in the ordinary course of the Business
            consistent with past practice) or entered into any capitalized
            leases;

                  (iv) accelerated collection of notes or accounts receivable
            generated by the Business to a date prior to the date such
            collection would have occurred in the ordinary course of the
            Business;

                  (v) delayed payment of any account payable or other liability
            of the Business beyond its due date or the date when such liability
            would have been paid in the ordinary course of the Business
            consistent with past practice;

                  (vi) changed accounting methods, principles or practices,
            except insofar as may have been required by law or by a change in
            generally accepted accounting principles;

            undertake capital expenditures exceeding $25,000 in the aggregate;

                  (viii) prepared or filed any Tax Return inconsistent with past
            practice or, on any such Tax Return, taken any position, made any
            election, or adopted any method that is inconsistent with positions
            taken, elections made or methods used in preparing or filing similar
            Tax Returns in prior periods (including, without limitation,
            positions, elections or methods which would have the effect of
            deferring income to periods for which Buyer is liable pursuant to
            Article XI or



                                       15

            accelerating deductions to periods for which the ACME Entities are
            liable pursuant to Article XI);

                  (ix) made any acquisition (by merger, consolidation,
            acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) of any corporation,
            partnership or other business organization or division thereof or
            interest therein; or

                  (x) entered into any agreement or made any commitment to take
            any action described in subparagraphs (i) through (ix) above.

            SECTION 4.6. NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.6 or except for those that would not have a Material Adverse Effect
either individually or in the aggregate, the Company is not subject to any
liability (including, without limitation, unasserted claims, whether known or
unknown), whether absolute, contingent, accrued or otherwise, which is not shown
or reserved for in the Balance Sheet, other than liabilities of the same nature
as those set forth in the Balance Sheet and the notes thereto and incurred in
the ordinary course of the Business after the Balance Sheet Date.

            SECTION 4.7. TAXES.

            (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7(a): (i) each Company and
each Company Group has filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns required to
be filed; (ii) all such Tax Returns are complete and accurate and disclose all
Taxes required to be paid by each Company and each Company Group for the periods
covered thereby and all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns have been
timely paid; (iii) all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) owed by
each Company and each Company Group have been timely paid; (iv) neither any
Company nor any member of any Company Group has waived or been requested to
waive any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes which waiver is currently
in effect; (v) the Tax Returns referred to in clause (i) have been audited by
the appropriate taxing authorities or the period for assessment of the Taxes in
respect of which such Tax Returns were required to be filed has expired; (vi)
there is no action, suit, investigation, audit, claim or assessment pending or
proposed or, to the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, threatened with respect to
Taxes of any Company or any Company Group and, to the Knowledge of the ACME
Entities, no basis exists therefor; (vii) all deficiencies asserted or
assessments made as a result of any examination of the Tax Returns referred to

Tax indemnity arrangements relating to any Company (other than this Agreement)
will terminate prior to the Closing Date and no Company will have any liability
thereunder on or after the Closing Date; (ix) there are no Encumbrances for
Taxes upon the assets or capital stock of any Company except Encumbrances
relating to current Taxes not yet due; (x) all Taxes which any Company is
required by law to withhold or to collect for payment have been duly withheld
and collected, and have been paid or accrued, reserved against and entered on
the books of such Company and (xi) no Company has been a member of an
"affiliated group" (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to
the limitations contained in Section 1504(b) of the Code) other than the Company
Group of which it is a member as of the date hereof and no Company has had any
direct or indirect ownership in any other Person.



                                       16
<PAGE>
            (b) No transaction contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code (relating to "FIRPTA").

            (c) No payment or other benefit, and no acceleration of the vesting
of any options, payments or other benefits, will be, as a direct or indirect
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, an "excess parachute
payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section
280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.7(c), no payment or other benefit, and no acceleration of the vesting
of any options, payments or other benefits, will, as a direct or indirect result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be (or under Section 280G of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder be presumed to be) a "parachute
payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section
280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, without regard to
whether such payment or acceleration is reasonable compensation for personal
services performed or to be performed in the future.

            SECTION 4.8. SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS.

            (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.8(a), the assets owned or
leased by the Company constitute all of the material assets necessary for or
used by the Company in the conduct of the Business and the operations of the
Station, and are in such good and serviceable condition and repair (subject to
ordinary wear and tear) as is necessary for the conduct of the Business and the
operations of the Station.

            (b) Schedule 4.8(b) sets forth a description of all material
services provided by the ACME Entities or any Affiliate of the ACME Entities to
the Business utilizing either (i) assets not owned or leased by the Company or
(ii) employees not listed in Schedule 4.16(a) and the manner in which the costs
of providing such services have been allocated to the Company.

            SECTION 4.9. GOVERNMENTAL PERMITS.

            (a) The Company owns, holds or possesses the Station Licenses and
all other licenses, franchises, permits, privileges, immunities, approvals and
other authorizations from a Governmental Body that are necessary to entitle it
to own or lease, operate and use the assets of the Station and to carry on and
conduct the Business (herein collectively called "Governmental Permits").
Schedule 4.9(a) sets forth a list and brief description of each such
Governmental Permit held by the Company as of the date of this Agreement.

            (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(b), the Company has
fulfilled and performed in all material respects its obligations under each of
the Governmental Permits, and no event has occurred or condition or state of
facts exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a material breach or material default under any such Governmental
Permit. No notice of cancellation, of default or of any dispute concerning any
Governmental Permit, or of any event, condition or state of facts described in
the preceding sentence, has been received by the ACME Entities or the Company.
Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(b), each of the Governmental Permits is
valid, subsisting and in full force and effect, and, subject to the receipt of
the FCC Consent and expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, may be
transferred to Buyer or its Affiliates in accordance with the transactions


                                       17
<PAGE>
contemplated by this Agreement and at such time of assignment or transfer will
be in full force and effect, in each case without (i) the occurrence of any
breach, default or forfeiture of rights thereunder or (ii) the consent, approval
or act of, or the making of any filing with, any Governmental Body or other
party (other than the FCC as contemplated by Section 6.3).

            (c) The Station is being operated in accordance with the Station
Licenses and in compliance in all material respects with the Communications Act,
the published rules and regulations thereunder, and all other published laws and
regulations, federal, state and local, applicable to the Station. Neither the
ACME Entities nor the Company have received any notice of any violations of the
Station Licenses, the Communications Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder. There is no action by or before the FCC currently pending or, to the
Knowledge of the ACME Entities, threatened to revoke, cancel, rescind, modify or
refuse to renew in the ordinary course any of the Station Licenses. The Station
Licenses are validly issued in the name of ACME Missouri Licensee as listed on
Schedule 4.9(a). True and complete copies of the Station Licenses have been
delivered to Buyer, including any and all amendments and other modifications
thereto. The Station Licenses are in full force and effect, are valid for the
balance of the current license term applicable generally to television stations
licensed in the state where the Station is located, are unimpaired by any acts
or omissions of the ACME Entities, the Company or any of their Affiliates, or
the employees, agents, officers, directors or managers, members or shareholders
of the ACME Entities, the Company or any of their Affiliates, and are free and
clear of any restrictions which might limit the operation of the Station in the
manner and to the full extent as it is now operated (other than restrictions
under the terms of the Station Licenses themselves and those restrictions in the
Communications Act and the rules and policies of the FCC generally applicable to
television stations of the same type). There are no applications, proceedings,
or complaints pending or, to the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, threatened
before a Governmental Body which may have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business, the Company or the operation of the Station (other than rulemaking
proceedings that apply to the television broadcasting industry generally). The
ACME Entities do not have Knowledge of any reason why those of the Station
Licenses subject to expiration might not be renewed in the ordinary course for a
full term without material modifications or of any reason why any of the Station
Licenses might be revoked. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9(c), the Station
is in compliance in all material respects with the FCC's published policy on
exposure to radio frequency radiation. No renewal of any Station License would
constitute a major environmental action under the published rules and
regulations of the FCC. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
the ACME Entities, there are no facts which, under the Communications Act or the
existing published rules and regulations of the FCC, would disqualify the
Company from transferring the Station Licenses or from consummating the
transactions contemplated herein within the times contemplated herein. The
Company maintains an appropriate public inspection file at the Station's studios
in accordance with published FCC rules and regulations. Access to the Station's
transmission facilities is restricted in accordance with the policies, rules and
regulations of the FCC.

            SECTION 4.10. REAL PROPERTY; REAL PROPERTY LEASES.

            (a) Schedule 4.10(a) contains a brief description of all real
property owned or leased by the Company (the "Real Property") and each option
held by the Company to acquire any Real Property. No real property other than
that listed on Schedule 4.10(a) is used in, held for


                                       18
<PAGE>
use in connection with, or necessary for the conduct of the Business or the
operation of the Station. The Company has marketable fee simple title (free and
clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances) to the owned Real
Property and has made available or delivered to Buyer copies of any current
title insurance policies with respect to the Real Property in its possession.

            (b) There are no material encroachments upon the Real Property owned
by the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, any Real Property
leased by the Company, by any buildings, structures, or improvements located on
adjoining real estate. To the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, none of the
buildings, structures, or improvements (including without limitation any ground
radials, guy wires or guy anchors) constructed on the Real Property owned by the
Company nor, to the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, any Real Property leased by
the Company, encroaches upon adjoining real estate, and all such buildings,
structures, and improvements are constructed in conformity with or are
"grandfathered" with respect to all "setback" lines, easements, and other
restrictions, or rights of record, or that have been established by any
applicable building or safety code or zoning ordinance, except in any case for
any of the foregoing which would not materially impair the ability of the
Company or Buyer to own or operate the Station or the Business or which would
not involve any material cost or expense to cure or remedy. No utility lines
serving the Real Property nor guy wires supporting any tower pass over the lands
of others except where appropriate easements have been obtained. Neither the
whole or any part of the Real Property owned by the Company nor, to the
Knowledge of the ACME Entities, any Real Property leased by the Company is
subject to any pending or threatened suit for condemnation or other taking by
any public authority. As of the date of this Agreement, there exists no writ,
injunction, decree, order or judgment, nor any litigation, pending, or to the
Knowledge of the ACME Entities, threatened, relating to the Company's or the
ACME Entities' use, lease, occupancy or operation of any of the Real Property.
The Company's use and occupancy of the Real Property complies with all
regulations, codes, ordinances, and statutes of all applicable governmental
authorities, including without limitation all environmental protection and
sanitary laws and regulations, occupational safety and health regulations, and
electrical codes, except where such failure to comply would not be material to
the Business. There are no material structural defects in the buildings,
structures, and improvements located on the Real Property. All towers and other
structures on the Real Property are painted and lighted in accordance, in all
material respects, with the requirements of the Station Licenses, the FCC, the
Federal Aviation Administration and all applicable requirements of federal,
state and local law. Each of the towers can structurally support all of the
permitted equipment in accordance with law, governmental approvals, and sound
engineering practices. All Real Property has legal and insurable access from a
public roadway for vehicles and by foot.

            (c) Schedule 4.10(c) sets forth a list of each lease or similar
agreement under which the Company is lessee of, or holds or operates, any Real
Property owned by any third Person, which are the sole and complete agreements
concerning the Company's use of the leased premises (the "Real Property
Leases"). Each Real Property Lease is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in
full force and effect. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the ACME
Entities, any other party is in default, violation or breach in any respect
under any Real Property Lease, and no event has occurred and is continuing that
constitutes or, with notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute a
default, violation or breach thereunder. No amount payable under any Real
Property Lease is past due. Neither the ACME Entities nor the


                                       19
<PAGE>
Company have received any notice of a default, offset or counterclaim under any
Real Property Lease or any other communication asserting non-compliance with any
Real Property Lease. To the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, the Company has the
exclusive right to use and occupy that portion of the premises leased under each
Real Property Lease. The Company enjoys, in all material respects, peaceful and
undisturbed possession of that portion of the premises leased under the Real
Property Leases. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10(c), the Company's
interests under the Real Property Leases are free and clear of all Encumbrances
(except for Permitted Encumbrances). The ACME Entities have made available to
Buyer, true and complete copies of the Real Property Leases, together, in the
case of any subleases or similar occupancy agreements, with copies of all other
leases. Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.3(c) or 4.10(c), no consent of any
third party is required under the Real Property Leases in connection with the
sale of the Shares to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement, and such sale of
the Shares will not affect the validity, enforceability and continuity of any
such lease.

            (d) All utilities that are required for the full and complete
occupancy and use of the Real Property, including, without limitation, electric,
water, sewer, telephone and similar services, have been connected and are in
good working order.

            SECTION 4.11. PERSONAL PROPERTY. Schedule 4.11 contains a list as of
November 30, 2002 of all machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture and other
personal property owned or leased by the Company having an original cost of
$10,000 or more or relating to the Business or used or held by the Company or
others for use by the Station (the "Personal Property"), except for Personal
Property leases set forth on Schedule 4.12. The Personal Property is in good
operating condition and repair (reasonable wear and tear excepted), is
maintained in compliance with good engineering practice, is performing
satisfactorily, has been properly maintained, in all material respects, in
accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations and industry practices, is
available for immediate use and is otherwise sufficient to permit the Station to
operate in accordance with the Station Licenses and the rules and regulations of
the FCC.

            SECTION 4.12. PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASES. Schedule 4.12 contains a
list of each lease or other agreement or right under which the Company is lessee
of, or holds or operates, any Personal Property owned by a third Person (the
"Personal Property Leases").

            SECTION 4.13. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) Schedule 4.13(a) contains a
list of (i) all call signs, United States and foreign patents, pending patent
applications, trademark registrations, pending trademark applications, trade
names, service marks, copyrights (registered or unregistered), logos, domain
names, and other similar intangible property rights, issued to, licensed to,
assigned to, filed by, or used by the Company or to promote or identify the
Station, or otherwise used in connection with the Business, and (ii) all
agreements, contracts and understandings therefor (clauses (i) and (ii) being
collectively the "Intellectual Property").

            (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.13(b), the Company either: (i)
owns the entire right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property
listed in Schedule 4.13(a), free and clear of Encumbrances except for Permitted
Encumbrances; or (ii) has the valid right and license to use the same.



                                       20
<PAGE>
            (c) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.13(c): (i) all patents and
registrations identified in Schedule 4.13(a) are in force, and all applications
identified in Schedule 4.13(a) are pending without challenge (other than office
actions that may be pending before the Patent and Trademark Office or its
foreign equivalents); (ii) the Intellectual Property owned by the Company is
valid and enforceable; and (iii) the Company has the right to bring actions for
infringement or unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property owned by it.

            (d) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.13(d): (i) neither the ACME
Entities nor the Company have received any written claim and otherwise have no
Knowledge of any claim that has been made or asserted that alleges the
Intellectual Property owned by the Company infringes the Intellectual Property
of another Person; (ii) no litigation, arbitration or other proceeding is
pending with respect to the Intellectual Property owned by the Company; and
(iii) no written claim, delivered or made available to the ACME Entities or the
Company, has been made or asserted that challenges the validity or ownership of
any Intellectual Property owned by the Company.

            (e) To the Knowledge of the ACME Entities, the operation of the
Station does not infringe any copyright, patent, trademark, trade name, service
mark, call sign or other similar right of any third Person. Neither the Company
nor the ACME Entities, in respect of the Company, have sold, licensed or
otherwise disposed of any of the Intellectual Property to any Person or agreed
to indemnify any Person for any patent, trademark or copyright infringement.

            SECTION 4.14. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            SECTION 4.15. TITLE TO ASSETS. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15,
the Company has good and marketable title to all of its tangible assets and
properties (or a valid leasehold or license interest, in the case of any leased
or licensed assets, as applicable), free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
for Permitted Encumbrances.

            SECTION 4.16. EMPLOYEES.

            (a) Schedule 4.16(a) contains: (i) a list of all individuals
employed by the Company in connection with the Business; and (ii) the titles,
employer and positions of such employees (the "Station Employees"). Since the

the compensation payable or to become payable to or for the benefit of any of
the Station Employees (other than normal annual salary increases consistent with
past practice), (B) provided any of the Station Employees with increased
security or tenure of employment, (C) increased the amount payable to any of the
Station Employees upon the termination of such persons' employment, or (D)

consent of Buyer or its stockholder. This Agreement is, and each Buyer Ancillary
Agreement when executed and delivered by Buyer and the other parties thereto
will be, a legal, valid and binding agreement of Buyer enforceable in accordance
with its respective terms, except in each case as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency, reorganization or other similar
laws affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except as such enforceability is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

this Agreement.

            SECTION 5.5. QUALIFICATIONS AS FCC LICENSEE. As of the date of this
Agreement, Buyer knows of no fact or circumstance which would, under the

FCC licensee of the Station without waiver of any published FCC rule or policy.
There are no proceedings, complaints, notices of forfeiture, claims or

            SECTION 5.6. INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION. The Shares are being
acquired by Buyer for its own account for investment, and not with a view to the

be entitled to make such engineering inspections of the Station, such
inspections of the Station for the purpose of appraising the Business and such
audits of the Company's or Station's financial records as Buyer may desire, so
long as the same do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Station; provided, that neither the furnishing of such information to Buyer or
its representatives nor any investigation made heretofore or hereafter by Buyer
shall affect Buyer's right to rely upon any representation or warranty made by
the ACME Entities in this Agreement, each of which shall survive any furnishing

Alternative Proposal and the source of its financing, on the terms proposed, and
(z) would result in a transaction more favorable to the ACME Entities and the
holders of their respective equity interests than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the KWBP Asset Purchase Agreement considered on an
aggregate basis.

            SECTION 6.12. COPIES OF FCC APPLICATIONS. The ACME Entities shall

            (a) The ACME Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, from the lessors under the Real Property Leases, executed versions of
estoppel certificates in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

            (b) Prior to the Closing, the ACME Entities shall obtain a

            (a) Buyer may, at its expense, conduct a review and examination with
respect to title of the Real Property, and the ACME Entities shall (and shall
cause the Company to) cooperate as reasonably necessary in completion of such
review and examination. If any such review and examination reflects the
existence of any defect, encumbrance, or other limitation with respect to any
such title which would cause a material limitation or exclusion from the title
insurance to be obtained under Section 6.14(b) (a "Title Defect"), the ACME
Entities shall (and shall cause the Company to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Title Defect to be cleared or otherwise remedied prior to
Closing.

            (b) Upon Buyer's request, the ACME Entities shall (and shall cause
the Company to) cooperate with Buyer to extent necessary for Buyer to obtain the
commitment of a title insurance company reasonably satisfactory to Buyer to
issue ALTA 1992 Form extended coverage title insurance policies with a zoning
endorsement insuring the Company's (or Buyer's or its Affiliate's) interest in
the Real Property (the "Title Commitment"). The costs of any Title Commitment
and the policy to be issued pursuant to such Title Commitment shall be paid by
Buyer.

            (c) Buyer, at its expense, may obtain surveys of the Real Property
performed by surveyors reasonably acceptable to Buyer sufficient to remove any
"survey exception" from the title insurance policies to be issued pursuant to
the Title Commitment.

            SECTION 6.15. ACME MISSOURI LICENSEE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS. Prior to
the Closing, Parent shall cause ACME Subsidiary Holdings III, LLC to transfer
all of its membership interests in ACME Missouri Licensee to ACME Missouri and
take such other actions to cause the membership interests of ACME Missouri
Licensee to be wholly-owned by ACME Missouri.

            SECTION 6.16. INTERCOMPANY OBLIGATIONS. The ACME Entities shall take
such action as may be necessary so that, as of the Closing Date, there shall be
no intercompany obligations between the Company, on the one hand, and any ACME
Entity or its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, including
any obligations pursuant to the agreements set forth in Schedule 4.8(b) and
Schedule 4.25.

            SECTION 6.17. PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASES. Prior to the Closing, the
ACME Entities (and not the Company) shall purchase, on behalf of the Company,
from Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. and General Electric Capital
Corporation the property leased under the leases with such entities referenced
in Schedule 4.12 and take such other actions so that such


                                       38
<PAGE>
property shall be owned by the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances as of
the Closing. Neither Buyer nor, after the purchase of the leased property as
contemplated hereby, the Company shall have any Liability, through the proration
provisions of Section 3.6 or otherwise, for any obligations under such leases or
with respect to the purchase of the property relating thereto.

            SECTION 6.18. LIEN REMOVAL. Prior to the Closing, the ACME Entities
shall take all necessary action to remove any Encumbrances (except Permitted
Encumbrances), including those referenced in Schedule 4.15, on the Shares and
the assets of the Company.

            SECTION 6.19. RESTRUCTURING. Prior to the Closing and with Buyer's
consent, ACME Missouri Holdings may merge with ACME Missouri, or it may be
liquidated and its assets distributed, so that ACME Television may become the
direct parent of ACME Missouri, provided that Buyer's consent to such
restructuring shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to indemnification
under Articles X and XI of this Agreement. In the event of such a restructuring,
Buyer and the ACME Entities shall amend this Agreement and the KWBP Asset
Purchase Agreement accordingly to reflect such restructuring.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

            SECTION 7.1. SALES, USE AND TRANSFER TAXES. Any sales, stock
transfer, use or other transfer Taxes payable by reason of transfer and
conveyance of the Shares, the Business, the Station or the Company's assets or
properties hereunder and any documentary stamp or transfer Taxes payable by
reason of the real estate or interests therein included shall be paid one-half
by Buyer and one-half by the ACME Entities. Except as set forth in Section 6.3,
all fees relating to any filing with any Governmental Body required for transfer
and conveyance of the Shares, the Business, the Station or the Company's assets
or properties hereunder, other than amounts (including Taxes) owing to any
Governmental Body as of the date hereof or with respect to events occurring
prior to the date hereof, shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the
ACME Entities.

            SECTION 7.2. EMPLOYEES; EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

            (a) The ACME Entities shall cause the Company to terminate its
participation in all Employee Plans for which an ACME Entity is the plan sponsor
that are listed on Schedule 4.22(a) (the "ACME Plans") as of the Closing Date.
The ACME Entities shall retain the liability for payment of all benefits under
the ACME Plans, and Buyer shall not assume nor shall the Company be responsible
for any liability with respect to such claims or related expenses. In no event
shall any Transferred Employee (as hereinafter defined) be entitled to accrue
any benefits under the ACME Plans after the Closing.

            (b) The Company (or one or more of its Affiliates, including Buyer,
after the Closing) will continue to employ on the Closing Date all active
Station Employees (except for Station Employees identified by Buyer within sixty
days after the date hereof, but in any event prior to the Closing, who shall be
retained by Seller or one of its Affiliates, and for whom Buyer


                                       39
<PAGE>
shall indemnify the ACME Entities for claims by any such employee solely to the
extent relating to Buyer's decision not to continue the employment of such
employee with the Company) at the level of salary, wages and commissions, if
applicable, comparable to similarly situated employees of Buyer and at the place
of employment of each such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes of the previous sentence, "active Station Employee" shall mean the
Station Employees who are properly classified as actively at work at the Station
on the Valuation Date or any Station Employee on approved maternity or paternity
leave of absence as of the Valuation Date.

            (c) Each Station Employee who accepts employment with Buyer pursuant
to Section 7.2(b) (referred to in this Agreement as a "Transferred Employee")
shall, subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, be eligible to
become a participant in such employee benefit plans (as such term is defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA) and such other programs and arrangements as may be
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer (other than the Tribune
Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the Tribune Company Savings Incentive
Plan) as soon as practicable following the closing; provided, however, that
Transferred Employees will be eligible to participate in Buyer's group health
plans immediately following the Closing without waiting periods or exclusion for
pre-existing conditions. Buyer shall not be obligated to provide, nor shall
assume any obligation or liability relating to, COBRA Coverage for any Station
Employee or any beneficiary who incurs a qualifying event on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall implement a new 401k Plan for the Transferred
Employees the ("Buyer 401(k) Plan"). To the extent requested by a Transferred
Employee, the ACME Entities shall permit a rollover, pursuant to Code Section
402(c), to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, in cash, of all of the individual account
balances of such Transferred Employee under the ACME Entities' 401(k) Plan,
including any outstanding plan participant loan receivables allocated to such
accounts subject to compliance with the requirements of the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

            (d) The ACME Entities shall be solely responsible for the ACME Plans
and all obligations and liabilities thereunder. Buyer shall not assume any of
the ACME Plans or any obligation or liability thereunder. The ACME Entities
shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and
against any adverse consequences that Buyer may suffer resulting from, arising
out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by, any actions taken by the
ACME Entities or their Affiliates or any ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
7.2(b) with respect to an ACME Plan.

            (e) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, the ACME Entities
will remain responsible for all claims under the applicable Employee Plans for
health, accident, sickness, and disability benefits deemed incurred prior to the
Closing Date by Station Employees regardless of whether payment is made after
the Closing Date. For all purposes under such Employee Plans, Transferred
Employees will be considered to have terminated employment with the ACME
Entities or their Affiliates as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Agreement: (i) a claim for health benefits (including, without limitation,
claims for medical, prescription drug and dental expenses) will be deemed to
have been incurred on the date on which the related medical service or material
was rendered to or received by the Station Employee claiming such benefit, (ii)
a claim for sickness or disability benefits based on an injury or illness
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date will be deemed to have been incurred
prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) in the case of any claim for benefits other
than health benefits and sickness and disability


                                       40
<PAGE>
benefits (e.g., life insurance benefits), a claim will be deemed to have been
incurred upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to such claims.

            (f) Any preexisting condition clause or waiting period in any of the
health coverage (including medical, dental and disability coverage) included in
Buyer's benefits programs shall be waived for the Transferred Employees to the
extent such crediting does not result in the duplication of benefits. For
purposes of any eligibility requirements, vesting requirements or differential
benefit provisions based on length of service under any of Buyer's benefit
programs (but not for purposes of pension benefit accruals), service of
Transferred Employees with the ACME Entities or their Affiliates (or any
predecessor thereof) will be treated as service with Buyer or its Affiliates.
Buyer shall ensure that each Transferred Employee receives credit under any
welfare benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates for any deductibles or
co-payments paid by such Transferred Employee and his or her dependents for the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs under a plan maintained by the
ACME Entities or any Affiliate of the ACME Entities, subject to Buyer's receipt
of such information within two months of the Closing Date. Buyer shall grant
credit to each Transferred Employee for sick leave and vacation time in
accordance with the policies of Buyer applicable generally to its similarly
situated employees after treating service for an ACME Entity, any Affiliate of
an ACME Entity, or any predecessor, as service for Buyer, subject to Buyer's
receipt of such information within two months of the Closing Date. To the extent
any claim with respect to vacation leave or sick leave accrued after the Closing
Date or accrued prior to the Closing Date to the extent Buyer has received a
credit under other provisions of this Agreement is lodged against an ACME Entity
with respect to any Transferred Employee, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless the ACME Entities from and against any and all Losses, directly or
indirectly, as a result of or based upon or arising from the same.

            (g) Buyer shall reimburse the ACME Entities for the costs of
severance benefits for each Station Employee, to the extent provided for
similarly situated employees under the Employee Plans, who does not receive an
offer of employment from Buyer. During the six-month period following the
Closing, Buyer will maintain a severance pay plan or policy for Transferred
Employees that provides benefits at least equal to the benefits provided for
such employees under any severance pay plan or policy maintained by the ACME
Entities immediately prior to the Closing. Schedule 4.22(a) sets forth the level
of severance benefits provided by the ACME Entities under any severance pay plan
or policy for such Transferred Employees.

            (h) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Station Employee any right to continued employment for any
period of time by reason of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein is intended
to confer upon any Station Employee any particular term or condition of
employment.

            SECTION 7.3. CONTROL OF OPERATIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING DATE.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Closing shall not
be consummated prior to the grant of the FCC Consent. The ACME Entities and
Buyer acknowledge and agree that at all times commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any of its employees, agents or
representatives, directly or indirectly, shall, or have any right to, control,
direct or otherwise supervise, or attempt to control, direct or otherwise
supervise any of the


                                       41
<PAGE>
management or operations of the Station, it being understood that the operation,
management, control and supervision of all programs, equipment, operations and
other activities of the Station shall be the sole responsibility, and at all
times prior to the Closing Date remain within the complete control and
discretion, of the ACME Entities and the Company, subject to the terms of
Section 6.4 of this Agreement.

            SECTION 7.4. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE OR SOLICIT BUSINESS. In
furtherance of the sale of the Shares to Buyer hereunder by virtue of the
transactions contemplated hereby and more effectively to protect the value and
goodwill of the Business, the ACME Entities covenant and agree that:

                  (i) until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, neither
            the ACME Entities nor any of their Affiliates (which term
            "Affiliate" shall not include the Company for purposes of this
            Section) will, directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent,
            independent contractor, partner or otherwise) own, manage, operate,
            control, provide consulting or management services for, or otherwise
            carry on, a television broadcast station similar to or competitive
            with the Business as conducted by the Company as of the Closing Date
            (a "Competitive Business") anywhere within the St. Louis, Missouri
            Designated Market Area (as defined by Nielsen Media Research, Inc.);
            or

                  (ii) until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, neither
            the ACME Entities nor any of their Affiliates will, induce or
            attempt to persuade any current employee, agent or customer of the
            Business to terminate such employment, agency or business
            relationship in order to enter into any such relationship on behalf
            of any Competitive Business;

provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 7.4 shall prohibit the
ACME Entities or any of their Affiliates from owning not in excess of 5% in the
aggregate of any class of capital stock of any corporation if such stock is
publicly traded and listed on any national or regional stock exchange or
included on the NASDAQ market system or similar system. In addition, the ACME
Entities covenant and agree that neither they nor any of their Affiliates will
divulge or make use of any trade secrets or other confidential information of
the Business existing as of the Closing Date other than to disclose such secrets
and information to Buyer or its Affiliates, except as required by applicable law
or regulation or by legal process. In the event the ACME Entities or any of
their Affiliates violate any of their obligations under this Section 7.4, Buyer
may proceed against them in law or in equity for such damages or other relief as
a court may deem appropriate. The ACME Entities acknowledge that a violation of
this Section 7.4 may cause Buyer irreparable harm which may not be adequately
compensated for by money damages. The ACME Entities therefore agree that in the
event of any actual or threatened violation of this Section 7.4, Buyer shall be
entitled, in addition to other remedies that it may have, to a temporary
restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against the
ACME Entities or such Affiliate of the ACME Entities to prevent any violations
of this Section 7.4, without the necessity of posting a bond. It is the intent
and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any action before any court
or agency legally empowered to enforce this Section 7.4, any term, restriction,
covenant or promise in this Section 7.4 is found to be unreasonable and for


                                       42
<PAGE>
that reason unenforceable, then such term, restriction, covenant or promise
shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable by such
court or agency.

            SECTION 7.5. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

            (a) As soon as practicable after the Closing, the ACME Entities
shall deliver to Buyer a complete and detailed list of all the Accounts
Receivable. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
one hundred twentieth (120th) day after the Closing Date (the "Collection
Period"), Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the
Accounts Receivable in the usual and ordinary course of business, using the
Station's credit, sales, and other appropriate personnel in accordance with
customary practices which may include referral to a collection agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required to institute legal
proceedings to enforce the collection of any Accounts Receivable. Buyer shall
not adjust any Accounts Receivable or grant credit without Seller's written
consent, and Buyer shall not pledge, secure, or otherwise encumber such Accounts
Receivable or the proceeds therefrom, other than to the extent such pledge,
security or encumbrance arises without any further action not specifically
required by Buyer under Buyer's or its Affiliates' financing instruments or
facilities in the ordinary course of business. On or before the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the end of each calendar month during the Collection Period,
Buyer shall remit to Seller collections received by Buyer with respect to the
Accounts Receivable, together with a report of all amounts collected with
respect to the Accounts Receivable during, as the case may be, the period from
the Closing or the beginning of such month through the end of such month, less
any reasonable sales commissions or collection costs paid by Buyer in the
ordinary course of its business during the respective periods with respect to
those Accounts Receivable, plus any sales commission chargebacks taken by Buyer
to the extent such sales commissions were previously deducted in determining the
amount to be paid to Seller hereunder.

            (b) Any payments received by Buyer during the Collection Period from
any Person that is an account debtor with respect to any account disclosed in
the list of Accounts Receivable delivered by the ACME Entities to Buyer shall be
applied first to the invoice designated by the account debtor and, if none, such
payment shall be applied to the oldest account which is not disputed. Buyer
shall incur no liability to the ACME Entities for any uncollected account, other
than as a result of Buyer's breach of its obligations under this Section 7.5, in
which case such liability shall not exceed the amount of the disputed Accounts
Receivable. Prior to the end of the Collection Period, neither the ACME
Entities, nor any agent of the ACME Entities, shall make any direct solicitation
of the account debtors for payment.

            SECTION 7.6. BROADCAST TRANSMITTER. On or prior to the Closing, the
ACME Entities shall cause the Company to transfer, and the ACME Entities shall
assume from the Company, any and all obligation for the payment of the purchase
price of the new analog Transmitter, provided that the Company shall retain
title to and possession of such transmitter prior to and as of the Closing.

            SECTION 7.7. THE DAILY BUZZ. From and after Closing, neither Buyer,
the Company nor the Station shall have any obligation to air or fund any portion
of The Daily Buzz, a program produced by the ACME Entities or their Affiliates
and currently shown on all stations owned or operated, directly or indirectly,
by the ACME Entities. The programming contract for


                                       43
<PAGE>
The Daily Buzz with respect to the Station and the Company shall be terminated
by the ACME Entities at or prior to Closing.

Entities agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer
Group Member from and against any and all Loss and Expense incurred by such
Buyer Group Member in connection with or arising from:

                  (i) any breach by the ACME Entities of, or any other failure
            of the ACME Entities or their respective Affiliates to perform, any
            of their covenants, agreements or obligations in this Agreement or
            in any ACME Ancillary


                                       46
<PAGE>
            Agreement (determined without regard to materiality or Material
            Adverse Effect qualifiers);

                  (ii) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
            representation of the ACME Entities contained or referred to in this
            Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the ACME
            Entities pursuant hereto (determined without regard to materiality
            or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers); or

                  (iii) any Losses, Expenses, Taxes or other amount for which,
            under Article XI, Buyer Group Members are to be indemnified by the
            ACME Entities;

provided, however, that the ACME Entities shall not be required to indemnify and
hold harmless pursuant to clause (ii) with respect to Loss and Expense incurred
by Buyer Group Members until the aggregate amount of all such Loss and Expense
exceeds $250,000 and then only to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
such Loss and Expense exceeds $125,000 and, provided, further, that the
aggregate amount that the ACME Entities shall be required to indemnify and hold
harmless pursuant to clause (ii) with respect to Loss and Expense incurred by
Buyer Group Members shall not exceed $50,000,000. The indemnification provided
for in this Section 10.1 shall terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date (and no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under this Section
10.1 thereafter), except that the indemnification by the ACME Entities shall
continue in any event as to:

            (A) the covenants of the ACME Entities set forth in this Agreement,
      as to all of which no time limitation shall apply, unless otherwise stated
      herein;

            (B) the covenants of the ACME Entities set forth in Section 7.4,
      which shall terminate one year after the expiration of the noncompetition
      period provided for therein;

            (C) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.7 and
      4.23 and the covenants of the ACME Entities set forth in Section 7.1 and
      any Loss or Expense incurred by any Buyer Group Member in connection with
      or arising out of the matters described in clause (iii) of this Section
      10.1, as to all of which no time limitation shall apply other than the
      full period of any applicable statute of limitations plus sixty (60) days;

            (D) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.3(b),
      4.15 and 4.26, as to which no time limitation shall apply; and

            (E) any Loss or Expense of which any Buyer Group Member has notified
      the ACME Entities in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.3 on
      or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in
      accordance with this Section 10.1, as to which the obligation of the ACME
      Entities shall continue until the liability of the ACME Entities shall
      have been determined pursuant to this Article X, and the ACME Entities
      shall have reimbursed all Buyer Group Members for the full amount of such
      Loss and Expense in accordance with this Article X.

            SECTION 10.2. INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Buyer agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless each ACME Group Member from and against any and all Loss and
Expense incurred by such ACME Group Member in connection with or arising from:

                  (i) any breach by Buyer, or any other failure of Buyer to
            perform, any of its covenants, agreements or obligations in this
            Agreement or in any Buyer Ancillary Agreement (determined without
            regard to materiality qualifiers);

                  (ii) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any
            representation of Buyer contained or referred to in this Agreement
            or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant
            hereto (determined without regard to materiality qualifiers); or

                  (iii) any Losses, Expenses, Taxes or other amount for which,
            under Article XI, ACME Group Members are to be indemnified by Buyer;

provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and hold
harmless pursuant to clause (ii) with respect to Loss and Expense incurred by
ACME Group Members until the aggregate amount of all such Loss and Expense
exceeds $250,000 and then only to the extent that the aggregate amount of all
such Loss and Expense exceeds $125,000. The indemnification provided for in this
Section 10.2 shall terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (and no
claims shall be made by any ACME Group Member under this Section 10.2
thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue in any
event as to:

            (A) the covenants of Buyer set forth in this Agreement, as to all of
      which no time limitation shall apply, unless otherwise stated herein;

            (B) the covenants of Buyer set forth in Section 7.1 and any Loss or
      Expense incurred by any Buyer Group Member in connection with or arising
      out of the matters described in clause (iii) of this Section 10.2, as to
      all of which no time limitation shall apply other than the full period of
      any applicable statute of limitations plus sixty (60) days;

            (C) the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.2(b)
      and 5.4, as to which no time limitation shall apply; and

            (D) any Loss or Expense of which any ACME Group Member has notified
      Buyer in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.3 on or prior to
      the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with
      this Section 10.2, as to which the obligation of Buyer shall continue
      until the liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this
      Article X, and Buyer shall have reimbursed all ACME Group Members for the
      full amount of such Loss and Expense in accordance with this Article X.

            SECTION 10.3. NOTICE OF CLAIMS. (a) If any Buyer Group Member (with
respect to Section 10.1) or any ACME Group Member (with respect to Section 10.2)
believes that it has suffered or incurred any Loss or incurred any Expense, such
Buyer Group Member or ACME Group Member, as the case may be (the "Indemnified
Party"), shall so notify the parties


                                       48
<PAGE>
obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the
"Indemnitor") promptly in writing describing such Loss or Expense, the amount
thereof, if known, and the method of computation of such Loss or Expense, all
with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to the provisions of
this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto in respect of which
such Loss or Expense shall have occurred (a "Claim Notice"); provided, however,
that the omission by the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligation under this
Article X except to the extent that such omission results in a failure of actual
notice to the Indemnitor and such Indemnitor is materially damaged as a result
of such failure to give notice. If any action at law or suit in equity is
instituted by or against a third Person with respect to which any Indemnified
Party intends to claim any liability or expense as Loss or Expense under this
Article X, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnitor of such
action or suit as specified in this Section 10.3.

            (a) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount
of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article X shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any
court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired
and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been
finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

            SECTION 10.4. THIRD PERSON CLAIMS.

            (a) Subject to Section 10.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to conduct and control, through one separate counsel (plus appropriate
local counsel) of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any
third Person claim, action or suit against such Indemnified Party as to which
indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified Party from any Indemnitor
hereunder, and in any such case the Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection
therewith and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; provided,
that the Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own
expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit as to which the
Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof; and
provided further that the Indemnified Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), pay, compromise or settle any such claim, action or suit, except that
no such consent shall be required if, following a written request from the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor shall fail, within fourteen (14) days after
the making of such request, to acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such
claim, action or suit shall be adversely determined, such Indemnitor has an
obligation to provide indemnification hereunder to such Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay, settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit without such consent,
provided that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder unless such consent is unreasonably withheld.



                                       49
<PAGE>
            (b) If any third Person claim, action or suit against any
Indemnified Party is solely for money damages or, where the ACME Entities are
the Indemnitor, will have no continuing effect in any material respect on the
Company or Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective businesses, assets or
operations, then the Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and control,
through counsel of its choosing and at its own expense, the defense, compromise
or settlement of any such third Person claim, action or suit against such
Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by any Indemnified
Party from any Indemnitor hereunder if the Indemnitor has acknowledged and
agreed in writing that, if the same is adversely determined, the Indemnitor has
an obligation to provide indemnification to the Indemnified Party in respect
thereof, and in any such case the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
connection therewith and shall furnish such records, information and testimony
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals
as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith;
provided, that the Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel chosen by
it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit as
to which the Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control the defense
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay, settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit, provided that
in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
hereunder unless the Indemnified Party shall have sought the consent of the
Indemnitor to such payment, settlement or compromise and such consent was
unreasonably withheld, in which event no claim for indemnity therefor hereunder
shall be waived.

            SECTION 10.5. LIMITATIONS. (a) In any case where an Indemnified
Party recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect
to which an Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by
it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in
respect of such matter and (ii) any amount reasonably expended by the Indemnitor
in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

            (a) Except in claims of common law fraud or except for equitable or
specific performance remedies, remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law
and injunctive and provisional relief, if the Closing occurs, this Article X
shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any
covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement).

            (b) To the extent of any inconsistency between this Article X and
Article XI, the provisions of Article XI shall control.

            (c) Each party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Loss and Expense that forms the basis for any claim for
indemnification hereunder.

            (d) In no event shall a party be entitled to indemnification for
such party's incidental, consequential or punitive damages.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                   TAX MATTERS

            SECTION 11.1. LIABILITY FOR TAXES. (a) Except as set forth in
subparagraph (b) below, the ACME Entities shall be liable for and pay, and
pursuant to Article X shall indemnify each Buyer Group Member against, (A) all
Taxes imposed on any Company, or for which any Company may otherwise be liable,
as a result of having been a member of a Company Group (including, without
limitation, Taxes for which any Company may be liable pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local or foreign law
as a result of having been a member of a Company Group), (B) all Taxes imposed
on any Company, or for which any Company may otherwise be liable, for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect
to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date (including, without limitation, any obligations to
contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined or
unitary basis with respect to a Company Group and any Taxes resulting from a
Company ceasing to be a member of a Company Group, (C) any interest or penalties
that are due to the failure (through no fault of Buyer) of any ACME Group Member
to timely prepare, assist in preparation or file or cause to be filed any Tax
Return required to be filed with respect to any Straddle Period, and (D) Taxes
arising as a result of any breach of a warranty or covenant of the ACME Entities
under this Agreement.

            (b) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article X
shall indemnify each ACME Group Member against, (A) all Taxes imposed on any
Company for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date and,
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date, other than Taxes for which such Company is
liable as a result of having been a member of a Company Group, (B) any Taxes to
the extent such Taxes were taken into account in making the computations
required by Section 3.6, (C) Taxes imposed on any Company resulting from
actions, decisions or elections undertaken or made by any Buyer Group Member
after the Closing, or any settlements effected by Buyer if Buyer has agreed to
forego indemnification as required by Section 11.3(b), (D) any interest or
penalties that are due to the failure (through no fault of the ACME Entities) of
any Buyer Group Member to timely prepare, assist in preparation or file or cause
to be filed any Tax Return required to be filed after the Closing Date, (E)
Taxes arising as a result of any other breach of a warranty or covenant of Buyer
under this Agreement and (F) Taxes that arise or are increased as a result of
any change after the Closing Date in the bases, methods, or policies of
accounting adopted by Company, provided, that the previous bases, methods, or
policies of accounting used by the Company were in accordance with applicable
Tax law.

            (c) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 11.1,
whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of any Company for
a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that
the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended
at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date, and subject to paragraph (d) of this Section
11.1, items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated


                                       51
<PAGE>
between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by
assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the close of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be
apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

            (d) Except as provided herein, the ACME Entities and their
Affiliates shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of any Company pertaining to
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending prior to or on the Closing Date. If
the ACME Entities or any Affiliate thereof becomes entitled to a refund or
credit of Taxes for which the ACME Entities are liable under paragraph (a) to
indemnify any Buyer Group Member, and such refund or credit is attributable to
the carryback of losses, credits or similar items from a taxable year or period
that begins after the Closing Date and is attributable to any Company, the ACME
Entities or such Affiliate shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount of such refund
or credit together with any interest (net of Taxes) thereon. Buyer will pay to
the ACME Entities an amount equal to any savings actually realized by any Buyer
Group Member in respect of the net operating loss carryforwards, and credit
carryforwards, of any Company existing as of the Closing Date. Buyer will make
such remittance promptly after such savings is realized by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment
has been made to Buyer or to the ACME Entities is subsequently reduced or
disallowed, Buyer or the ACME Entities shall indemnify and hold harmless the
ACME Entities or Buyer, respectively, for any Tax assessed by reason of the
reduction or disallowance. If any adjustment is made to any Tax Return of any
Company for a period for which the ACME Entities are liable under subparagraph
(a) to indemnify any Buyer Group Member, and which results in an indemnification
payment by the ACME Entities, and which also results in any deduction, exclusion
from income, addition to tax basis or other allowance (a "Tax Benefit") to the
Company or any of its Affiliates in a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, the Company or Buyer shall pay to the ACME
Entities the amount of the tax reduction attributable to such Tax Benefit at
such time or times as, and to the extent that, such Tax Benefit is realized;
provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply to any Tax Benefit (i)
arising from an adjustment to a Tax Return of any Company which also results in
a Tax Benefit (for example, through an increase in stock basis) to any of the
ACME Entities or Affiliates or (ii) recognized after the second full taxable
year following the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.

            SECTION 11.2. FILING OF TAX RETURNS.

            (a) The ACME Entities shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable years or
periods ending on or before or including the Closing Date on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with any entity other than solely the Company) or
due on or before the Closing Date (with respect to other Tax Returns) and in
each case the ACME Entities shall remit or cause to be remitted any


                                       52
<PAGE>
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Subject to the requirements of
subparagraph (b) of this Section 11.2, Buyer shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all
other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to each
Company and Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect
of such Tax Return. The ACME Entities or Buyer shall promptly reimburse the
other party the Taxes for which the ACME Entities are, or Buyer is, liable
pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Article XI but which are payable with any Tax
Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to this Section 11.2(a) upon the
written request of the party entitled to reimbursement setting forth in detail
the computation of the amount owed by the ACME Entities or Buyer, as the case
may be, but in no event earlier than 10 days prior to the due date for paying
such Taxes. All Tax Returns that the ACME Entities are required to file or cause
to be filed in accordance with this Section 11.2(a) shall be prepared and filed
in a manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position
shall be taken, elections made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing and filing similar
Tax Returns in prior periods (including positions, elections or methods which
would have the effect of deferring income to periods for which Buyer is liable
under Section 11.1(b) or accelerating deductions to periods for which the ACME
Entities are liable under Section 11.1(a)).

            (b) Buyer shall file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required
to be filed after the Closing Date that relate to a Straddle Period. All Tax
Returns that Buyer is required to file or cause to be filed under this Section
11.2(b) shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice
and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, elections made or method
adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods, except as
required by law or as regarding separate versus unitary or combined tax filing.
The ACME Entities or Buyer shall promptly reimburse the other party the Taxes
for which the ACME Entities are, or Buyer is, liable pursuant to Section 11.1 of
this Article XI but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed pursuant
to this Section 11.2(b) upon the written request of the party entitled to
reimbursement setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by the
ACME Entities or Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than 10 days
prior to the due date for paying such Taxes. Tax Returns required to be filed
pursuant to this Section 11.2(b) shall be provided to the ACME Entities for
review and comment no later than 10 days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns, taking into account any applicable extensions (or, if such due date
or extended due date is within 10 days following the Closing Date, as promptly
as practicable following the Closing Date). Buyer will consider in good faith
any comments received from the ACME Entities and will consult with the ACME
Entities to resolve such comments prior to the due date or extended due date for
the filing of such Tax Return.

            (c) Without the ACME Entities' prior written consent, no Buyer Group
Member shall permit, or cause to be permitted, an amendment of any Tax Return of
the Company pertaining to Taxes for which the ACME Entities are responsible
pursuant to Section 11.1(a), unless required by applicable law.

            SECTION 11.3. CONTEST PROVISIONS.

            (a) Buyer shall notify the ACME Entities in writing upon receipt by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or, after the Closing Date, any Company of notice
of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments which may affect the Tax
liabilities of the Company for which the ACME Entities would be required to
indemnify any Buyer Group Member pursuant to


                                       53
<PAGE>
this Article XI, provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not
affect any Buyer Group Member's right to indemnification hereunder except to the
extent such failure materially impairs the ACME Entities' ability to contest any
such Tax liabilities.

            (b) The ACME Entities shall have the sole right to represent each
Company's interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, however, that the ACME Entities
shall have no right to represent the Company's interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding unless the ACME Entities shall have first
notified Buyer in writing of the ACME Entities' intention to do so; provided,
further, that Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted, at Buyer's
expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.
Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
any obligation to defend the Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding. In the case of a Straddle Period, the ACME Entities and their
representatives shall be permitted, at their expense, to be present at, and
participate in, any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in
whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
ACME Entities and their Affiliates shall not be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
which could adversely affect the liability for Taxes of Buyer, the Company or
any Affiliate thereof for any period after the Closing Date to any extent
(including the imposition of income Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset
basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation
periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction
of loss or credit carryforwards) without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be necessary if
the ACME Entities have indemnified Buyer and its Affiliates against the effects
of any such settlement. Buyer shall have the sole right to defend the Company
with respect to any issue arising with respect to any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date to the extent Buyer shall have agreed in writing to
forego any indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such issue,
provided, that such issue does not pertain to a consolidated or combined Tax
Return. Neither Buyer, nor any of its Affiliates, shall be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for
Taxes that would result in or increase the ACME Entities' obligation to
indemnify a Buyer Group Member, or decrease a net operating loss or credit
carryforward existing on the Closing Date, without the ACME Entities' prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and which
consent shall not be necessary if the ACME Entities are relieved of their
indemnification obligations with respect to such Taxes and appropriately
compensated for the reduction of such carryforwards, as applicable.

            SECTION 11.4. ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing Date,
the ACME Entities and Buyer shall (and cause their respective Affiliates to):

            (a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce),
or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section
7.1 (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes);



                                       54
<PAGE>
            (b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such
other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section
11.2;

            (c) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company;

            (d) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes
of the Company; and

            (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received
from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information
request with respect to any such taxable period.

            SECTION 11.5. INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS ON AFTER-TAX BASIS. Any
indemnification payment under this Article XI with respect to a Loss or Expense
shall be an amount that is sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party for
the amount of such Loss or Expense, after taking into account all increases or
decreases in Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates as a
result of the receipt of such payment or the taking of any deduction related to
the Loss or Expense giving rise thereto (by reason of such payment being
included in income, resulting in a reduction of tax basis, or otherwise
increasing or decreasing such Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates at any time); provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, any
indemnification payment under this Article XI shall not take into account any
increases or decreases in Taxes recognized after the second full taxable year of
the Company following the taxable year that includes the Closing Date.

            SECTION 11.6. SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this
Article XI shall be unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect for
the full period of any applicable statute of limitations plus sixty (60) days.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                            TERMINATION AND REMEDIES

            SECTION 12.1. TERMINATION.

            (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

                  (i) by the mutual written consent of the ACME Entities and
            Buyer;

                  (ii) by the ACME Entities in the event of a material breach by
            Buyer of any of its agreements, representations or warranties
            contained in this Agreement or if any of the representations or
            warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall have been
            inaccurate in any material respect when made, and the failure of
            Buyer to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of
            written notice from the ACME Entities requesting such breach to be
            cured;



                                       55
<PAGE>
                  (iii) by Buyer in the event of a material breach by the ACME
            Entities of any of their respective agreements, representations or
            warranties contained in this Agreement or if any of the
            representations or warranties of the ACME Entities contained in this
            Agreement shall have been inaccurate in any material respect when
            made, and the failure of the ACME Entities to cure such breach
            within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Buyer
            requesting such breach to be cured;

                  (iv) by the ACME Entities or Buyer if any court of competent
            jurisdiction in the United States or other United States
            Governmental Body shall have issued a final and non-appealable
            order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or
            otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
            contemplated hereby;

                  (v) by Buyer, pursuant to the provisions of Section
            13.13(a)(ii) hereof;

                  (vi) by Buyer, pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.13(b)
            hereof;

                  (vii) by the ACME Entities or Buyer if the Closing shall not
            have occurred within one year after the date of this Agreement (or
            such later date as may be mutually agreed to by the ACME Entities
            and Buyer); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
            Agreement under this Section 12.1(a)(vii) shall not be available to
            any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
            Agreement shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure
            of the Closing to occur prior to such date; and

                  (viii) by the ACME Entities as contemplated by Section
            6.11(b)(ii)(B).

            SECTION 12.2. NOTICE OF TERMINATION. Any party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1 shall give notice of such termination to
the other party to this Agreement.

            SECTION 12.3. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event that this
Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to this Article XII, all further
obligations of the parties under this Agreement (other than the provisions of
Sections 13.2 and 13.10) shall be terminated without further liability of any
party to the other; provided that

                  (i) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
            any breach of this Agreement;

                  (ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
            12.1(a)(viii), the ACME Entities shall pay Buyer $7,300,000, by wire
            transfer of same day funds before or contemporaneously with such
            termination, as liquidated damages as full and final settlement of
            all claims of Buyer under this Agreement and there shall be no
            further remedies of Buyer hereunder; provided that, if at or prior
            to such termination by the ACME Entities pursuant to Section
            12.1(a)(viii) any of the ACME Entities have materially breached
            Section 6.11 of this Agreement,


                                       56
<PAGE>
            such fee and expenses described above shall not constitute
            liquidated damages or full and final settlement of all claims of
            Buyer and neither the provisions of this Section 12.3(ii) nor the
            payment or receipt of the fees and expenses described above shall
            limit Buyer's remedies hereunder for such breach; and

                  (iii) if (A) the Agreement is terminated by the ACME Entities
            pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(ii), (B) at the time of such termination
            all of the conditions contained in Articles VIII and IX to the
            parties' respective obligations to consummate the Closing have been
            satisfied (or upon delivery of the certificates described in
            Sections 8.1 and 9.1 would be satisfied) or waived by the party
            entitled to the benefit thereof or such conditions have not been
            satisfied solely by reason of Buyer's wrongful failure to fulfill
            its obligations under this Agreement, (C) notwithstanding a request
            by the ACME Entities to consummate the Closing, Buyer violates its
            obligations under Section 3.1 to consummate the Closing, and (D) no
            ACME Entity is otherwise in material breach hereunder, then Buyer
            shall pay to the ACME Entities, taken as a whole, an amount equal to
            $6,800,000 plus the ACME Entities shall be entitled to the Escrow
            Deposit, together with 50% of all interest and other proceeds from
            the investment of the Escrow Deposit; Buyer and the Escrow Agent,
            respectively, shall make such payments within five (5) business days
            after the ACME Entities' notice of termination to Buyer and the
            Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
            Escrow Agreement, as liquidated damages as full and final settlement
            of all claims of the ACME Entities under this Agreement and there
            shall be no further remedies of the ACME Entities hereunder.

            SECTION 12.4. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES NOT A PENALTY. With respect to the
liquidated damages provided for in Section 12.3, the ACME Entities and Buyer
agree that neither the damage that may be suffered by Buyer if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(viii) nor the damage that may be suffered
by the ACME Entities if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated as a result of Buyer's wrongful failure to close hereunder in
accordance with Section 12.3(iii), is readily ascertainable and as such
liquidated damages on the date hereof are a reasonable estimate of such damages
and are intended to compensate the injured party(ies) for any such damage and
are not intended to be construed as a penalty.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

            SECTION 13.1. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
OBLIGATIONS. All representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
contained in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that, except as otherwise
provided in Article X or herein, the representations and warranties contained in
Articles IV and V of this Agreement shall terminate eighteen (18) months after
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 4.3(b), 4.15, 4.26, 5.2(b) and 5.4 shall survive without limitation and
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.7 and


                                       57
<PAGE>
4.23 shall survive for the full period of any applicable statute of limitations
plus sixty (60) days. Except as otherwise provided herein, no claim shall be
made for the breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article IV or
V after the date on which such representations and warranties terminate as set
forth in this Section.

            SECTION 13.2. CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF INFORMATION. Each party agrees
that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information
which it shall have obtained regarding the other party during the course of the
negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the investigation
provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related
documents, and, in the event the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be
consummated, each party will, upon request, return to or destroy the other party
all copies of nonpublic documents and materials which have been furnished in
connection therewith. Without limiting the right of either party to pursue all
other legal and equitable rights available to it for violation of this Section
13.2 by the other party, it is agreed that other remedies cannot fully
compensate the aggrieved party for such a violation of this Section 13.2 and
that the aggrieved party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent a
violation or continuing violation hereof.

            SECTION 13.3. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without reference to its choice of law rules.

            (a) The rights of any party under this Agreement shall not be

of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either party may
assign from all or a part of its rights under this Agreement to an Affiliate of

Agreement.

            SECTION 13.6. ACCESS TO RECORDS AFTER CLOSING.

            (a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date the ACME
Entities and their representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the
books and records of the Company or the Business transferred to Buyer hereunder
to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by the ACME Entities
in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the
Company or the Business prior to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded
by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours.


                                       59
<PAGE>
The ACME Entities shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred
by them pursuant to this Section 13.6(a). If Buyer shall desire to dispose of
any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period,
it shall, prior to such disposition, give the ACME Entities a reasonable
opportunity, at the ACME Entities' expense, to segregate and remove such books
and records as the other party may select.

            (b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Company or the Business which the ACME Entities or any of their
Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by
the ACME Entities and their Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 13.6(b). If the ACME
Entities or any of their Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books
and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, the ACME Entities
shall, prior to such disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at
Buyer's expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as the other
party may select.

            SECTION 13.7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. This Agreement, the
Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with
regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all
prior agreements, understandings or intents between or among any of the parties
hereto. The parties hereto, by mutual agreement in writing, may amend, modify
and supplement this Agreement.

            SECTION 13.8. INTERPRETATION. Article titles and headings to
sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with
and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set
forth verbatim herein. Any items disclosed in the Schedules shall be referenced
to the applicable Section and subsection, if applicable, of the Agreement to
which such items relate. Any references in this Agreement to "herein," "hereto,"
"hereof," "herewith" or "hereunder" shall be to this Agreement as a whole. As
used in this Agreement, the word "including" is not limiting and the word "or"
is not exclusive. Whenever the word "dollar" or the symbol "$" is used in this
Agreement, such word or symbol shall mean United States dollars. All parties
have participated in the negotiation and review of this Agreement and no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed more strictly against any party.
All remedies provided for hereunder are cumulative except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement.

            SECTION 13.9. WAIVERS. Any term or provision of this Agreement may
be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. The failure of any party hereto to
enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be
a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce
each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall
be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.



                                       60
<PAGE>
            SECTION 13.10. EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, each of the ACME Entities and Buyer will pay all of its own respective
costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement
and to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions
contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the
fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and accountants.

            SECTION 13.11. PARTIAL INVALIDITY. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been
contained herein unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would
result in such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be unreasonable.

            SECTION 13.12. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an
original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to each of the ACME Entities and
Buyer.

            SECTION 13.13. RISK OF LOSS; DAMAGE TO FACILITIES.

            (a) Risk of Loss. The risk of loss or damage to the Station and the
assets of the Company shall be on the ACME Entities prior to the Closing Date
and thereafter shall be on Buyer. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, including, without limitation, Section 10.1, if any of the assets
of the Company or the Station is damaged or destroyed prior to the Closing Date
(any such event being referred to as an "Event of Loss") and such Event of Loss
shall materially affect the operations of the Station, and repair or replacement
cannot be accomplished by the scheduled Closing Date but can be accomplished
within 30 days after that date, the ACME Entities may postpone the Closing Date
for that 30-day period in order to undertake such repair or replacement; if,
however, the repair or replacement cannot be accomplished within that 30-day
period, Buyer may elect:

                  (i) to consummate the Closing and accept all the assets of the
            Company and the Station as is, in which event the ACME Entities
            shall assign to Buyer at the Closing all of their rights under any
            insurance policies and to all insurance proceeds covering that Event
            of Loss (less amounts due to the assigning party for repairs or
            replacements of the property prior to the Closing); or

                  (ii) to terminate this Agreement without liability on the part
            of the ACME Entities or Buyer.

If the Closing Date is postponed beyond the time specified in Section
12.1(a)(vii), the parties shall amend their application to the FCC to request an
extension of the date of Closing.



                                       61
<PAGE>
            (b) Failure of Broadcast Transmission. The ACME Entities shall give
prompt written notice to Buyer if the regular broadcast transmissions of the
Station in the normal and usual manner are interrupted or discontinued. If such
interruption occurs for more than seventy-two (72) hours, whether or not
consecutive, during any period of thirty (30) consecutive days, then Buyer may,
at its option: (i) terminate this Agreement without liability on the part of the
ACME Entities or Buyer, or (ii) proceed with the Closing in the manner set forth
in Section 13.13(a)(i).

            SECTION 13.14. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The ACME Entities and
Buyer do not intend by the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement
to confer a benefit upon any Person not a party to this Agreement.

            SECTION 13.15. CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. Subject to the provisions
of Section 6.11, the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated January
24, 2001, as amended November 14, 2002, between Tribune Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), shall remain in full force and effect through the
Closing and shall not be superseded by the terms of this Agreement unless and
until the Closing occurs; provided, however, that in the event that the Closing
occurs, such Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically be terminated and be
of no further force or effect.

            SECTION 13.16. PERFORMANCE BY SELLER. On behalf of Seller, Parent
hereby covenants and agrees to take all necessary action to cause Seller to
discharge, perform, comply and otherwise satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement.

            communities of license listed in Exhibit A.

      2.    To our knowledge, the FCC Licenses are not subject to any condition
            or requirement, other than conditions or requirements that appear on

            consent on its own motion has expired and, to our knowledge, the FCC
            has not undertaken such review.
