<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>(b) On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall file the Articles of Merger (the &#147;</FONT><U><FONT face=serif>Articles of Merger</FONT></U><FONT face=serif>&#148;) executed in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the PBCL with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger have been accepted for record by the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or at such other, later date and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PBCL (such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the &#147;</FONT><U><FONT face=serif>Effective Time</FONT></U><FONT face=serif>&#148;).</FONT></P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>(c) The Merger shall generally have the effects set forth in Section 1929, and any other applicable provisions, of the PBCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.</FONT></P>

Immediately prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Disbursing Agent cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any cash necessary to pay for Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.4. Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall not be used for any other purposes; provided, however, that Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker&#146;s acceptances of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, or (iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s Corporation or Moody&#146;s Investor Services, Inc.

<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record holder of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will specify that delivery of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) to the Disbursing Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation that the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, without interest. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect thereof.</FONT></P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not payable.</FONT></P>

<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp; If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered such holder&#146;s Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Disbursing Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for an amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.</FONT></P>

Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company or to enforce specifically the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. Whether or not Parent or Merger Sub seeks specific performance pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to Damages in excess of the amount of the Termination Fee. Upon the payment, as applicable, by the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b) or 9.2(c) and the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.2(e) and 9.2(g) or which may be payable in respect of a Section 9.1(d)(i) Covenant Breach Termination, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents shall have any further monetary liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</FONT></P>
