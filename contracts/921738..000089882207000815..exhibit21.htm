Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (d) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019 or (ii) at such other place and at such date and time as the Company and Parent may agree (the actual date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "), as soon as reasonably practicable but, in any event, no later than the seventh Business Day after the day on which the last condition to the Merger set forth in Article VIII is satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).

 

 Section 2.2. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of the Shares:

 

 (a) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Shares acquired by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time), if any, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect thereto.

  (b) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Parent (or its parent entity) shall be recapitalized effective as of the Effective Time to implement the Dual Voting Structure. The voting shares issuable by Parent (or its parent entity) shall be held by one or more Delaware limited liability companies owned by the Licensed Persons, and the non-voting shares issuable by Parent (or its parent entity) shall be held indirectly through one or more Delaware limited liability companies held by equity providers.

 

 (c) Each Share (including any Company Restricted Shares, except as provided in Section 2.2(e)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)) automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive $67.00 in cash (as adjusted by the last sentence of this Section 2.2(c) if applicable, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest, payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or the book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") formerly representing such Share in the manner provided in Section 2.3. Such Shares (including any Company Restricted Shares, except for those which, in accordance with Section 2.2(e), are not cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration), other than those canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and any Shares owned by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (which Shares shall remain outstanding), sometimes are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_." In the event that the Effective Time shall not have occurred by June 15, 2008 (the " _Adjustment Date_ "), the $67.00 cash amount per share payable pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.2(c) shall be increased for each day after the Adjustment Date through and including the Closing Date, by adding thereto an amount equal to $0.0149 per day.

 

 (d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares is changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration payable per Share and any other dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of the Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other dependent items, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this Section 2.2(d) .

 

 (e) Each Share (other than those canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or any applicable restricted stock award agreements (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Shares_ "), shall, by virtue of this Agreement and in accordance with Section 2.4(b), vest and become free of such restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time and, except for Company Restricted Shares as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Company Restricted Shares shall be treated as so agreed, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(c) .

 

 (f) The Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as provided in Section 2.4.

  Section 2.3. _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares and Company Options_.

 

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to serve as the disbursing agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the Company Options (the " _Disbursing Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Disbursing Agent cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any cash necessary to pay for Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.4. Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall not be used for any other purposes; provided, however, that Parent may direct the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, or (iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and Poors Corporation or Moodys Investor Services, Inc. Any profit or loss resulting from, or interest and other income produced by, such investments shall be for the account of Parent.

 

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record holder of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will specify that delivery of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) to the Disbursing Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation that the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, without interest. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect thereof.

 

 (c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not payable.

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Disbursing Agent, such Shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article II.

 

 (e) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered such holders Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Disbursing Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for an amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 (f) Except as provided in Section 2.2, from and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

 

 (g) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect thereof entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 (h) Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Company Restricted Shares or Company Options pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company Restricted Shares or Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  Section 2.4. _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

 (a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be accelerated and become vested and, except for Company Options as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Company Options shall be treated as so agreed, will be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option, without interest. All payments with respect to canceled Company Options shall be made by the Disbursing Agent as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of Parent for the purpose of paying such amounts in accordance with Section 2.3(a) .

 

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent will adopt such resolutions and take such other commercially reasonable actions as are reasonably necessary in order to effectuate the actions contemplated by Section 2.2(e) and this Section 2.4, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, provided that such resolutions and actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no effect if this Agreement is terminated.

not applicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by valid action of the Board of Directors of the Company
prior to the execution and delivery hereof and (ii) those which do not

in Parent, or any lender or underwriter under the Debt Financing Commitments,
has ever been denied a gaming license, approval, or related finding of
suitability by any Gaming Authority, or had any gaming license revoked or

 Section 5.12. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to any matter whatsoever except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms hereof and specifically (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing) that the Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives) of future revenues, results of operations (or any component thereof), cash flows or financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) the future business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

 Section 5.13. _Solvency_. Immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to the Merger, the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries will not (i) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts, including 

  contingent and unliquidated debts, is greater than its assets, at a fair
valuation, or because the present fair saleable value of its assets is less
than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,
including contingent and unliquidated debts, as they become absolute and
matured); (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
business; or (iii) have intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should
have believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay them as

 Section 7.2. _Best Efforts_.

 

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Authorities (including Gaming Authorities) or other Persons; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to obtain any consent, approval or waiver required for the consummation of the Merger under any Contract other than _de minimis_ amounts or amounts that are advanced or simultaneously reimbursed by Parent. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 7.2 to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act. Subject to the foregoing, Parent agrees, and shall cause any member or shareholder of Parent or any Affiliate of any member or shareholder of Parent, to undertake any divestiture or restrict the conduct with respect to its business to obtain any necessary approvals under the HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties shall request and shall use their respective best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable.

  (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 7.2(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Canadian Competition Bureau (the " _CCB_ ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, the CCB or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, the CCB or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 7.2(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ, the CCB or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in furtherance of the foregoing, shall become subject to, consent and agree to, and otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement, order to sell, hold separate and otherwise dispose of, and to conduct, restrict, operate, invest and otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any Subsidiary in any manner unless such action would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company as of the Effective Time.

 

 (d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 7.2(a), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby agrees to use best efforts (i) to as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, obtain all licenses, Permits, approvals, authorizations, registrations, findings of suitability, franchises, entitlements, waivers and 

  exemptions issued by any Gaming Authority required to permit the parties
hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
necessary to permit Parent to own and operate the Company (collectively, "
_Gaming Approvals_ "), (ii) to avoid any action or proceeding by any Gaming
Authority challenging the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) to make or cause to be made all necessary filings, and
thereafter make or cause to be made any other required submissions with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as
required under the Gaming Laws, (iv) to schedule and attend (or cause to be
scheduled and attended) any hearings or meetings with Gaming Authorities to
obtain the Gaming Approvals as promptly as possible and (v) to comply with the
terms and conditions of any and all of the foregoing as necessary to obtain
the Gaming Approvals. Such efforts shall include but not be limited to: (i)
restructuring or committing to restructure Parents or the Surviving
Corporations capital structure, to the extent practicable without having a
material adverse impact on the value of and returns on Parents or its
Affiliates equity investment; (ii) replacing or issuing non-voting equity to
(to the extent such replacement or issuance would cure the problem by
preventing a Licensed Person from having any influence, directly or
indirectly, over Parent or the Surviving Corporation) one or more Licensed
Persons who are preventing or materially delaying the receipt of Gaming
Approvals; (iii) agreeing to divest assets or operations to the extent
practicable without having a material adverse impact on the value of and
returns on Parents or its Affiliates equity investment; (iv) upon the
Closing, placing in trust assets or operations in those gaming jurisdictions
which permit such action or agreeing to permit assets or operations to operate
without interference from Parent, pending obtaining control upon subsequent
regulatory approval; and (v) accepting operating restrictions on the Surviving
Corporation to the extent practicable without having a material adverse impact
on the value of and returns on Parents or its Affiliates equity investment
(it being understood that, for purposes of this Agreement, any determination
as to whether an action described in this sentence has a material adverse
impact on the value of and returns on Parents or its Affiliates equity
investment shall not be deemed to include any impact or effect resulting from
any divestiture or disposition of any assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which, as of the date hereof, the Companies and its Subsidiaries
have committed to make to satisfy any Gaming Authority or which is disclosed
in Section 6.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter).

 

 (f) Parent and Merger Sub shall cause all Persons who are associated or affiliated with such party or its Affiliates who are, in the view of the applicable Gaming Authorities, required to be licensed under applicable Gaming Laws in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Licensed Persons_ "), to submit to the licensing process and, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to prepare and file all documentation to effect all necessary filings, consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders for all Gaming Authorities. Parent and its Representatives and Affiliates shall use best efforts to (i) file or cause to be filed (x) within 60 calendar days after the date hereof all required initial applications and documents in respect of officers and directors, Affiliates or holders of equity in Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, in connection with obtaining the Gaming Approvals and (y) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof all other required applications and documents in connection with obtaining the Gaming Approvals, (ii) request or cause to be requested an accelerated review from the Gaming Authorities in connection with such filings, (iii) act diligently and promptly to pursue the Gaming Approvals, (iv) cooperate with the Company in connection with the making of all filings referenced in this Section and (v) keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of Parents application for Gaming Approvals and its activities 

  related to obtaining the Gaming Approvals, as applicable, including promptly
advising the Company upon receiving any communication from any Gaming
Authority that causes Parent or Merger Sub to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any Gaming Approval required from such Gaming
Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will
be materially delayed.

 

 (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall, and shall cause its directors, officers, employees and Subsidiaries to, use best efforts in working with Parent and Parents counsel to obtain the Gaming Approvals.

 

 (h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, take or agree to take any action (including entering into agreements with respect to any acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or business combinations) which could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or observe or perform any of their obligations hereunder.

 

 Section 7.3. _Access to Information_.

 

 (a) Subject to the restrictions imposed by the Gaming Laws, the HSR Act, federal and state securities Laws and other applicable Laws, the Company will provide and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide Parent and Merger Sub and their respective authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice (i) such access to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and such Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries) as Parent or Merger Sub reasonably may request and (ii) all documents that Parent or Merger Sub reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives shall not have access to any books, records, documents and other information (i) to the extent that books, records, documents or other information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party (provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers under such agreements or implement requisite procedures to enable reasonable access without violating such agreement), (ii) to the extent that the disclosure thereof would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or (iii) to the extent required by applicable Law (provided that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enable the provision of reasonable access without violating such Law). All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreements.

 

 (b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives shall affect the representations or warranties of the other set forth herein.

 

 Section 7.4. _Solicitation_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m., New York City Time, on the 45th day thereafter (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company and 

  its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
consultants, agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives ("
_Representatives_ ") shall have the right to:

 

 (i) initiate, solicit and encourage, whether publicly or otherwise, Company Acquisition Proposals (as hereinafter defined), including by way of providing access to non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more confidentiality agreements that are on terms, with respect to the maintenance of confidentiality of the Companys information, which are consistent with the Confidentiality Agreements; and

 

 (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Company Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or the making of any Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

 (b) Subject to Section 7.4(c), from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, none of the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations, or (B) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to Section 7.4(c) and except with respect to any Person who as of the No-Shop Period Start Date has made a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal or who is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Company regarding a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal as of the No-Shop Period Start Date, which in either instance the Companys Board of Directors has determined constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (an " _Excluded Party_ "), following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Within 48 hours of or the next Business Day immediately following the No-Shop Period Start Date, whichever is later, the Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of whether or not the Company is participating in discussions or negotiations with an Excluded Party and the identity of each such Excluded Party and provide Parent a copy of each Company Acquisition Proposal received from any such Excluded Party (or, where no such copy is available, a description of such Company Acquisition Proposal).

  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.4(b), if at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, (i) the Company has not knowingly breached any material provision of Section 7.4(b) and the Company has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party (including a Company Acquisition Proposal received prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date from an Excluded Party) that the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith to be bona fide and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company will not, and will use reasonable best efforts not to allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without entering into a confidentiality agreement on terms, with respect to the maintenance of confidentiality of the Companys information, which are consistent with the Confidentiality Agreements. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly (within two Business Days) notify Parent in the event it receives (i) a Company Acquisition Proposal or written indication by any Person that it is considering making a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business or unrelated to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall include in such notice the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry, and shall keep Parent reasonably apprised as to the status and any material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the same. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within two Business Days) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to provide non-public information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Section 7.4(c) other than with an Excluded Party, in each case after the No-Shop Period Start Date. Except to the extent provided in Section 7.4(a) or 7.4(c), the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.4(b) or this Section 7.4(c), prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, the Company will in any event be permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to any Excluded Party.

 

 (d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly withdraw or modify the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to do so; provided, that if at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify its Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, including by failing to include the Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement (" _Recommendation Withdrawal_ ") if such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to take such action likely would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  In order for the Board of Directors of the Company to make the determination,
that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to provide Parent prior written notice, at least
three Business Days in advance (or, in the event of a material modification of
a Company Acquisition Proposal with respect to which prior written notice of
such intention to determine has previously been provided, the period shall be
one Business Day in advance) of its intention to determine that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys shareholders or taking any position with respect to the Merger if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside counsel, failure to so take and/or disclose likely would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or necessary to comply with obligations under federal securities Laws or the NASDAQ Global Select Market; provided, any such disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Recommendation Withdrawal unless the Board of Directors of the Company expressly reaffirms in such disclosure the Recommendation.

 

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 shall prohibit the Company from responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 7.4.

 

 (g) As used in this Agreement, the term:

 

 (i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase (whether in a single transaction or a series of transactions) of a business or businesses that constitutes 20% or more of the cash flow, net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class or series of Company Securities, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class or series of Company Securities, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business or businesses constitute(s) 20% or more of the cash flow, net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); and

 

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written, bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal (except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%"), which the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines is more favorable to the shareholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  Section 7.5. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the maximum extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless (including by advancing funds for expenses) (i) the present and former officers and directors (or equivalent) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from and against any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (" _Damages_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time, including the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) such persons from and against any and all Damages arising out of acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer or director (or equivalent) or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance of the type and with an amount of coverage as specified in Section 7.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and with such other terms as are no less favorable in the aggregate than those of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained as of the date hereof by the Company and its respective Subsidiaries (the " _Current Policies_"); provided that, in satisfying such obligation, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be obligated to pay premiums per annum in excess of 300% of the aggregate per annum amount that the Company paid for such coverage under the Current Policies in the last full year prior to the date hereof.

 

 (b) This Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or former directors or officers (or equivalent) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

 

 (c) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer (or equivalent) is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers and directors (or equivalent) and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies.

  Section 7.6. _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts (i) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 Section 7.7. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken by the Company or its Board of Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.4, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties will use reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public announcement primarily relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public announcement as may be required by applicable Law, court process or any listing agreement with the NASDAQ Global Select Market, will use reasonable efforts not to issue any such press release or make any such public announcement without consulting the other parties. Parent and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable joint press release announcing this Agreement.

 

 Section 7.8. _Employee Matters_.

 

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (" _Current Employee_ ") may have under any Company Benefit Plan, Employment Agreement or collective bargaining agreement, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for each Current Employee (i) base salary or hourly wage rate, and target cash bonus opportunities under annual programs and commissions (including any performance goals which must be attained to achieve any such target cash bonus), but excluding equity-based compensation (collectively, " _Compensation_ "), that are no less favorable in the aggregate than, and (ii) welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Compensation and benefits maintained for and provided to such Current Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, subject to the obligations set forth in this Section 7.8, nothing herein shall (A) be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan, (B) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their respective terms, or (C) interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee at any time in a manner consistent with any applicable contractual obligations and any applicable Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and determination of level of benefits (including for purposes of vacation and severance) under any Employee Benefit Plans and any other employee compensation and incentive plans, 

  benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements, in
each case maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of and after the
Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation (each,
a " _Parent Plan_ ") for such Current Employees service prior to the
Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities, to the same extent such service is recognized by the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each
Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), Parent or its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-
existing condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements with respect to the Current Employees and their eligible
dependents and (ii) give effect, for the year in which the Closing occurs, for
purposes of satisfying any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations,
to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Current
Employees and their eligible dependents under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries in which such Current Employees and their
eligible dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and all of its Subsidiaries to assume and honor, in accordance with their respective terms, (i) each existing employment, change in control, severance and termination plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any officer, director or employee of that company, on the other hand, (ii) each equity-based plan, program or agreement and each bonus plan, program or agreement and (iii) all obligations pursuant to existing benefit restoration plans, equity-based plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans, programs or agreements, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements in effect as of the Effective Time.

 

 (d) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employees), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 7.8) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

 Section 7.9. _Financing_.

 

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives, including legal and accounting, to, at Parents sole cost and expense for any and all out-of-pocket expenses, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent with reasonable notice in connection with the Financing, including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, business projections and financial statements (including those required by the SEC) and similar documents required in connection with the Financing, provided that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries needs to be the issuer of any such presentations, documents, memoranda

   or prospectuses, (iii) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources with
readily-available historical financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including
all historical financial statements and financial data of the type required
by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the type
and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act, to use in connection with the Debt Financing or any other
financing transaction executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Required Financial Information_ "), (iv) using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal
opinions, surveys, affidavits and title insurance as may be requested by
Parent or the lenders under the Debt Financing Commitments, (v) using
commercially reasonable efforts to provide monthly financial statements
(excluding footnotes) within 25 days of the end of each month prior to the
Closing Date, if and in the form now currently prepared by the Company, (vi)
executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time, any pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents, as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary thereof with respect to solvency matters and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral (including cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing
indebtedness and the release of related Liens), (vii) taking all actions
reasonably necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the
Financing to evaluate the Companys current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements and (B) so long as not effective until
on or after the Effective Time, establish bank and other accounts and blocked
account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing,
(viii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels
and approvals from other parties to material leases, encumbrances and
contracts to which any Subsidiary of the Company is a party and to arrange
discussions among Parent, Merger Sub and their financing sources with other
parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts as of the Effective
Time, and (ix) taking all corporate actions reasonably necessary to authorize
the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to
be made available (it being understood that to the greatest extent
practicable, the actions contemplated by this Section 7.9(a)(ix) shall not be
required to be taken until immediately prior to, and unless subject to, the
Closing and that the Company shall have satisfied its obligations pursuant to
this sentence if the Company shall have used the efforts required hereby to
comply with such obligations, whether or not any applicable deliverables are
actually obtained or provided); provided that nothing contained in this
Section 7.9 shall require such cooperation to the extent that it would
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Company shall cause its officers, in their capacities as
officers, to deliver such customary management representation letters as any
audit firm may reasonably request in connection with any comfort letters or
similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing. The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection
with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company and its marks. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required, under the provisions
of this Section 7.9 or otherwise in connection with the Debt Financing (x) to
pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time that is
not advanced or simultaneously reimbursed by Parent, or (y) to incur any

  out-of-pocket expense unless such expense is advanced or simultaneously
reimbursed by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all Damages suffered or incurred by them and any claims made against them in
connection with (1) any action taken by them at the request of Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 7.9 or in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing or (2) any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries), and this
indemnification shall survive termination of this Agreement. Nothing contained
in this Section 7.9 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing. All material, non-public information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub or their
Representatives pursuant to this Section 7.9(a) shall be kept confidential by
them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements except for disclosure
to potential investors as required in connection with the Financing subject to
customary confidentiality protections.

 

 (b) Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable, including using its best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments and negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements that are within its control, and (iii) comply with its obligations under the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date (including taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and other Persons to provide such Financing). In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall promptly notify the Company and, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, use its best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources on terms not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub, in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (x) all or any portion of the contemplated Debt Financing structured as high-yield financing has not been consummated, (y) all closing conditions contained in Article VIII shall have been satisfied or waived (or are capable of being satisfied at a Closing), and (z) the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments (or alternative bridge financing obtained in accordance with this Section 7.9) are available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments (or replacements thereof), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing at the Closing.

 

 (c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other material provision under the Financing Commitments without the consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would impose new or additional conditions or otherwise amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that may cause any delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (including with respect to approvals required under any Gaming Laws). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, one or more Debt Financing 

  Commitments may be superseded at the option of Parent and Merger Sub after the
date hereof but prior to the Effective Time by new debt financing commitments
(the " _New Financing_ _Commitments_ ") which replace existing Debt Financing
Commitments; provided, that the terms of the New Financing Commitments shall
not (A) impose new or additional conditions or adversely amend the existing
conditions to the receipt of the Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitments or (B) cause or increase the possibility of causing any delay in
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII. In such event,
the term "Financing Commitments" as used herein shall be deemed to include the
Financing Commitments that are not so superseded at the time in question and
the New Financing Commitments to the extent then in effect.

 

 Section 7.10. _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other parties of:

 

 (a) the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person, which consent is or would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries or the operation of their businesses, is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 (b) the receipt by such party of any material notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

 (c) its learning of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced against, or affecting such party that, if they were pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.10 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties
receiving such notice.

 

 Section 7.11. _Confidentiality Agreements_. Parent acknowledges on behalf of each of Fortress Investment Group LLC and Centerbridge Associates, L.P. that each such firm continues to be bound by the applicable Confidentiality Agreement (including any "standstill" provisions therein), and the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not in any manner modify or limit the Companys, Fortress Investment Group LLCs or Centerbridge Associates, L.P.s rights and obligations under such agreement; provided, however, that the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such Confidentiality Agreement, in the event that the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal such Confidentiality Agreement shall not be deemed to limit or restrict Parent from proposing to the Board of Directors of the Company any modifications or amendments to this Agreement.

 

 Section 7.12. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt 

  under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that
certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding
such matters.

 

 Section 7.13. _Treatment of Certain Notes_. 

 

 (a) At the request and expense of Parent, the Company shall promptly at a time reasonably requested by Parent, commence, or cause its Subsidiaries to promptly commence, an offer to purchase, and a related consent solicitation (the " _Consent Solicitation_ "), with respect to any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Companys publicly traded senior notes and/or senior subordinated notes identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date hereof (the " _Notes_ ") on price terms that are acceptable to Parent and such other customary terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to be consummated substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds provided by Parent (including the related Consent Solicitation, collectively, the " _Debt Tender Offer_ ") and Parent shall assist the Company in connection therewith. The Company shall irrevocably take all corporate actions necessary for the Debt Tender Offer and the Consent Solicitation. Promptly following the expiration date of the Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite consents are received with respect to such series of Notes, the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture to the indentures governing each such series of Notes (each, an " _Indenture_ "), amending the terms and provisions of each such Indenture as reasonably requested by Parent and as set forth in the Debt Tender Offer documents sent to holders of such series of Notes (which amendment may include the elimination of all or substantially all of the covenants contained in such Notes or the Indenture related thereto which can be eliminated upon the favorable vote of the holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof), which supplemental indenture shall become operative immediately upon the Effective Time, and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under each such Indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or substantially simultaneously with the Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Tender Offer. The closing of the Debt Tender Offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Tender Offer to close on the Closing Date; provided that the consummation of the Debt Tender Offer with respect to any series of Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and purchase each series of Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided) immediately available funds to the Company for the prompt and full payment at the Effective Time of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent required pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer.

 

 (b) If requested by the Parent in writing, in lieu of commencing a Debt Tender Offer for any series of Notes, the Company shall, to the extent permitted by such series of Notes and the applicable Indenture, (A) substantially simultaneous with the Effective Time issue a notice of optional redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the applicable Indenture and (B) take any other actions reasonably requested by the Parent to facilitate the satisfaction and discharge of 

  such series of Notes pursuant to the satisfaction and discharge provisions of
the applicable Indenture and the other provisions of such Indenture applicable
thereto; provided that prior to the Companys being required to take any of
the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the Parent shall have, or
shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the applicable
Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and satisfaction and
discharge. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of any series of
Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the
"Discharge" of such series of Notes. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Discharge of any Series of Notes identified to
the Company by Parent in writing at any time.

 

 (c) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company (which may require an advance of the amount of such costs, fees and expenses), reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Debt Tender Offer or Discharge in respect of any series of Notes. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives for any liabilities incurred by any of them in connection with any action taken by them to the extent pursuant to this Section 7.13 with respect to any Debt Tender Offer or Discharge; provided, however, that the Parent shall not have any obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the extent such damages suffered or incurred is attributable to the information provided by the Company that is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have contained a material misstatement or omission.

 

 (d) The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations set forth in clauses (a) through (d) of this Section 7.13 if the Company shall have used its reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations, regardless of the actual outcome of any Debt Tender Offer or Discharge.

 Section 9.2. _Termination Fee_.

 

 (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with any such termination.

 

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii), the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to (x) 50% of the Termination Fee and (y) the Parent Expenses as promptly as possible (but in any event within four Business Days) following such termination of this Agreement. In addition, in the event that (i) any such termination occurs pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii), (ii) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn or terminated prior to such termination of this Agreement, and (iii) within nine months after such termination of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into (and thereafter consummates) a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced), then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to 50% of the Termination Fee, less the amount of Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), as promptly as possible (but in any event within four Business Days) following such consummation. For purposes of this Section 9.2(b), the term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 7.4 but references therein to "20%" shall be replaced with "50%").

  (c) In the event that (i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) and the Company shareholders shall have not approved this Agreement by the Requisite Shareholder Vote or (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), (ii) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn or terminated prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, and (iii) within nine months after such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into (and thereafter consummates) a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, any Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent by the Company, as promptly as possible (but in any event within four Business Days) following such consummation (provided that solely for purposes of this Section 9.2(c), the term "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal contained in Section 7.4 but references therein to "20%" shall be replaced with "50%").

 

 (d) Parent shall pay the Reverse Termination Fee to the Company or as directed by the Company as promptly as possible (but in any event within four Business Days) following termination of this Agreement in any of the circumstances set forth in any of the following clauses (i)-(iii): (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) or 9.1(c)(iii); (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(ii) (if attributable to Gaming Approvals) or Section 9.1(b)(iv); or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) and all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been satisfied or waived (or are capable of being satisfied at a Closing) except for the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(d) (if attributable to Gaming Approvals), provided that the Company is not substantially at fault for the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(d) to be satisfied.

 

 (e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent as promptly as possible (but in any event within four Business Days of such termination) all of Parents and Merger Subs reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement (only to the extent not otherwise previously paid to, or for the benefit of, Parent by the Company prior to the termination of this Agreement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Parent Expenses_ "); provided that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.2(e) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(c) except to the extent indicated in such Section 9.2(c); and provided, further, that the reimbursement for Parent Expenses shall in no event exceed $17.5 million in the aggregate.

 

 (f) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b), 9.2(c), 9.2(d) or 9.2(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee, or Parent be obligated to pay the Reverse Termination Fee, on more than one occasion.

  (g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.2 do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay Parent the Termination Fee or Parent Expenses when due or Parent fails to pay the Company the Reverse Termination Fee when due, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by such other party in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.2 and shall pay interest on the amount of the Termination Fee, Parent Expenses or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded daily, from the date such Fee or Expenses became due and owing through and including the date of payment. In addition, the parties further agree that, if the Company fails to pay Parent any amount payable under this Agreement when due or Parent fails to pay the Company any amount payable under this Agreement when due (other than the amounts referred to in the prior sentence), the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay interest on such amount at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded daily, from the date such amount became due and owing through and including the date of payment.

 

 Section 9.3. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates hereunder, except Sections 7.2(a) (solely with respect to the reimbursement obligations of Parent), 7.9(a) (solely with respect to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent), 7.11, 7.13 (solely with respect to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent), 9.2 and 9.3 and Article X will survive the termination hereof.

Each party hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any of the aforementioned courts that any such suit, action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail; provided that nothing in this Section 10.11 shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

  UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

 

 Section 10.13. _Remedies_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parents and Merger Subs right to terminate this Agreement and receive, as applicable, the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b) or 9.2(c) and the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.2(e) and 9.2(g) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents except that if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i) as a result of a breach of a covenant or agreement or other intentional breach on the part of the Company (a " _Section 9.1(d)(i) Covenant_ _Breach Termination_ "), the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and Merger Sub, if any, against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers and agents shall be from the Company, and in such event the Company shall not be directly or indirectly liable for losses and damages arising from or in connection therewith in an aggregate amount in excess of the Termination Fee. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, damages would be difficult to determine and would be an insufficient remedy and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in all material respects by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise materially breached (or the Company were to threaten such a breach). The Company irrevocably waives any defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by Parent or Merger Sub. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company or to enforce specifically the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. Whether or not Parent or Merger Sub seeks specific performance pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to Damages in excess of the amount of the Termination Fee. Upon the payment, as applicable, by the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b) or 9.2(c) and the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.2(e) and 9.2(g) or which may be payable in respect of a Section 9.1(d)(i) Covenant Breach Termination, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents shall have any further monetary liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and receive, as applicable, payment of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(d) and any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 7.2(a), 7.9(a) and 9.2(g) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur, damages would be difficult to determine and would be an insufficient remedy and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in all material respects by Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise materially breached (or Parent or Merger Sub were to threaten such a breach). Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably waive any defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by the Company. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub under this Agreement, including Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded at the Closing if all of the conditions to Closing set out in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 are satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied upon the Closing). Whether or not the Company seeks specific performance pursuant to the foregoing provision or otherwise, in no event shall the Company be entitled to Damages in an amount in excess of the Reverse Termination Fee. Upon the payment, as applicable, of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(d) and any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 7.2(a), 7.9(a) and 9.2(g), none of the Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents shall have any further monetary liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
