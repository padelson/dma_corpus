shares of Company Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option, constitutes 91% of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option or (ii) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized
to issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued)
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option.

part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time, so long as the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Purchaser and
Parent constitutes at least 80% of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding. The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of
Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the
Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such shares by
the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Purchaser, at
its election, either entirely in cash or by paying in cash an amount equal to
not less than the aggregate par value

and time at which the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common
Stock by Parent or Purchaser is to take place. At the closing of the purchase
of such shares of Company Common Stock, Parent or Purchaser shall cause to be
delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in
exchange for such shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent
or Purchaser (as the case may be) a certificate representing such shares. The
obligation of the Company to issue such shares will be subject to compliance
with all applicable regulatory requirements.

directors as may be required by such rules or securities laws for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other

amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates on the
date that is 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered their Certificates evidencing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_
shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in

registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately

with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as

to _Section 3.7_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 3.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser, the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized to take all
such lawful and necessary action on behalf of the Company and Purchaser.

or Acquisition Inquiry or take any action that is intended to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal;

in response to or in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry (for avoidance of doubt, it being understood that the foregoing shall
not prohibit the Company from furnishing, in the ordinary course of business
and in a manner and to the extent consistent with the Companys past
practices, any non-public information to (A) any actual or potential customer,
supplier, distributor, licensor, licensee, partner or other Person to the
extent necessary to facilitate any business dealings between the Company and
such actual or potential customer, supplier, distributor, licensor, licensee,
partner or other Person that are unrelated to any Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Inquiry, or (B) a Governmental Authority);

(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (for avoidance
of doubt, it being understood that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
Company or any of its advisors or representatives from making a party making
an Acquisition Proposal aware of the restrictions of this _Section
7.1(a)(iii)_ in response to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, nor shall
it prohibit the Company from engaging in discussions with its advisors or
representatives to the extent reasonably necessary to assist the Company in
determining how to properly respond to such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry); or

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend to the Company Stockholders any Acquisition
Proposal;

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, directly or indirectly
through advisors, agents or other intermediaries or representatives, (A)
engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person that has
made a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal in writing that the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside legal counsel)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (B)
furnish to any such Person described in clause (A) above any non-public
information relating to the Company pursuant to a confidentiality, standstill
and nonsolicitation agreement the terms of which are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; and _provided further_ , that in the case of any action taken
pursuant to clause (A) or clause (B) above, (1) the Company Board received
such Acquisition Proposal other than as a result of a breach or violation of
the terms of this _Section 7.1(a)_, (2) the Company Board shall first have
reasonably determined in good faith, after having taken into account the
advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such

Business Days prior to engaging or participating in any such discussions or
negotiations with, or furnishing any non-public information to, such Person,
the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and all
of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of
the Companys intention to engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish non-public information to, such Person, and (4)
contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent
such information has not

 been previously furnished by the Company to Parent). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that if
any officer, director, agent, representative, employee, attorney, accountant
or advisor of the Company (whether or not such Person is purporting to act on
behalf of the Company) takes any action that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this _Section 7.1(a)_ by the Company, then such
action shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this _Section 7.1(a)_ by the
Company.

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
7.1(a)_ hereof, the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within one (1)
Business Day of its receipt, advise Parent orally (to be confirmed in writing
as soon as practicable thereafter) of the receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, including the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status and material terms and conditions (including all
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry.

(c) Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any
Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

(d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any

party or under which the Company has any rights, except to the extent the
Company is required to do so by the terms of any such
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement, and will use its best efforts to enforce
or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent. The
Company also shall promptly request each Person that since January 1, 2006
has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration
of a possible Acquisition Transaction or equity investment to return (or
destroy, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement) all confidential information heretofore furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of Company, subject to the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement.

 7.2 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to the terms of  _Section 7.2(b)_ hereof, the Company Board
shall (i) recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, tender
their Company Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and adopt this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the Company Board
Recommendation (with respect to the Offer) in the Schedule 14D-9 and permit
Parent to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Subject to the terms of this _Section 7.2(b)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, or resolve or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation (any of the foregoing, a " _Company Board Recommendation
Change_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) the Company Board has received an
Acquisition Proposal (that has not been withdrawn) that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have resulted from any
breach or violation of the terms of  _Section 7.1_; (ii) such Acquisition
Proposal is binding and is reflected in a form of definitive acquisition
agreement executed on behalf of the Person that made such Acquisition Proposal
(the " _Specified Acquisition Agreement_ "); (iii) the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and taking into account any revisions to the terms hereof proposed by
Parent pursuant to clause (vi) below), that, in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change is likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
to the Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (iv) prior
to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall
have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days written notice of its
intent to effect a

referred to in clause (iv) above, the Company shall have negotiated in good
faith with Parent and Parents officers, directors, representatives and agents
the terms of possible revisions to the terms of this Agreement; and (vi)
Parent shall not have made during such five (5) Business Day period a binding
offer to revise the terms hereof that (if implemented) would make the
Acquisition Proposal reflected in such Specified Acquisition Agreement cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal. If, as of the date on which the written
notice contemplated by clause (iv) of the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence is given by the Company to Parent, there are less than six (6)
Business Days remaining prior to the next scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, then (without limiting any of the extension rights or other rights that
Parent or Purchaser may have pursuant to this Agreement), unless Purchaser
elects to extend the Offer pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)(v)_ hereof or the
Offer is otherwise extended pursuant to any other provision of _Section
2.1(d)_ hereof, Purchaser shall extend the Offer to the date that is six (6)
Business Days following the date on which such written notice is given by the
Company to Parent, or for such longer period as may be required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq that
is applicable to the Offer.

(c) Without limiting any rights or remedies of Parent or Purchaser set forth
in this Agreement that might exist as a consequence of any such action,
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions
of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosures to the Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the Company
Board is required to make in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under Delaware Law.

 7.3 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Short-Form Merger_.

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required under Delaware Law in
order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL,

Time or the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
Delaware Law. Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or
adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting if there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented at the Company Stockholders Meeting
necessary to conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Companys obligation
to establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall not be
limited to, or otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable
Legal Requirements.

(b) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall vote all Company Shares acquired in the
Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of
Purchaser beneficially owned by it in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.1(c)_ hereof or this 
_Section 7.3_, in the event that Purchaser shall acquire at least ninety
percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of the Company

 7.4 _Proxy Statement_.

expiration of any subsequent offering period provided in accordance with Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC a proxy statement, letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and
form of proxy accompanying the Proxy Statement that will be provided to the
Company Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use

to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty
is made or covenant is agreed to by the Company with respect to information
supplied by Parent or any of its officers, directors, representatives, agents
or employees in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company shall advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its
staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments
thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable law, disseminated
to the Company Stockholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq.

or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.5(a)_ hereof, each of Parent and the Company shall file, as soon as may be
reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, and, as soon as may be reasonably
practical following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any
comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
foreign Governmental Entity that is required by the merger notification or
control laws and regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction. Each of
Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any
information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings, and

Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger). If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), then such party shall use all reasonable efforts to make, or cause to
be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_
hereof, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall ensure that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise take all
actions necessary to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company to
agree to any divestiture by itself or by any of its Affiliates of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock, in each case in a
manner that would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on
such party (in the case of Parent, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

will be equal to the quotient equal to (x) the per share exercise price
for such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
_divided by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Each Assumed Company Option shall be vested immediately following the

subject thereto as it was vested as to immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time, except to the extent such Assumed Company Option (either by its terms or
by the terms of another Contract) provides for acceleration of vesting

practicable following the Acceptance Time (and in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the Acceptance Time), Parent shall issue to each holder of
an Assumed Company Option a document evidencing the assumption of the
applicable Company Option by Parent as contemplated by this _Section
7.10(a)_. Subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, Parent shall take
all corporate action reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Assumed Company Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this
_Section 7.10(a)_ and shall, from and after the Acceptance Time, honor the
obligations of the Company to the holders of Assumed Company Options under the
Company Option Plan.

(iii) _Section 16 of the Exchange Act_. The Company Board shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective

stockholders and the number of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company
Options which may be subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and any
other information reasonably requested by Parent and relating to the same, the
board of directors of Parent shall, prior to the Acceptance Time, take

Act, the deemed grant of options to purchase Parent Common Stock under the
Company Options (as assumed pursuant hereto).

(iv) _Form S-8_. Parent shall file with the SEC no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the Acceptance Time a registration statement on Form S-8

Common Stock, when issued upon exercise of Assumed Company Options, to be
approved for quotation on Nasdaq.

be necessary (under the Company Option Plan and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 7.10(a)_ and to ensure that, from and after the
Acceptance Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect
thereto other than those specifically provided in this  _Section 7.10(a)_.

(b) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all actions as are necessary (i)
to ensure that each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP (each,
a " _Purchase Right_ ") shall be exercised to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock on the day that is one (1) Business Day prior to the Acceptance
Time in accordance with Section 13(b)(ii) of the Company ESPP, and to make
any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a

Company ESPP, and (ii) to provide that, as and after the Acceptance Time, no
further offering periods or purchase periods shall commence, and all of the
Purchase Rights shall terminate, under the Company ESPP; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such exercise and cessation of further offering and purchase
periods, and the termination of the Purchase Rights, shall be conditioned upon
the occurrence of the Acceptance Time. Immediately following the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP.

 7.11 _Company Warrants_. Each warrant to purchase shares of the Company
Common Stock (a " _Company Warrant_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior
thereto shall, in accordance with its terms, cease to represent a right to
acquire shares of the Company Common Stock and automatically shall be
converted, at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the
holder, into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (x) the amount, if positive, by which the Merger
Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant,
multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Warrant. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to (a) honor the obligations of the
Company under the Company Warrants, and (b) deliver notice of the consummation

the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation shall permit all Continuing Employees to participate in
the benefit plans, programs, and arrangements of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Plans_ ") to the same extent as
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, subject to any
necessary transition period and subject to any applicable plan provisions,
contractual requirements or Legal Requirements. Continuing Employees shall be
given credit under the Parent Plans for all years of service with the Company
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting in respect
of a matching contribution under a Parent Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Code and the determination of rate of vacation accrual.

(b) Subject to applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements and Legal
Requirements, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any Parent Plan that is a
group health plan to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents to the same extent waived under comparable Employee
Plans as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) under the Parent Plans give
each of the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs toward applicable deductibles
and annual out of pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective
Time for which payment has been made to the same extent credited under
comparable Employee Plans.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 7.12_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any employee of the Company to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation, and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment. Except for Indemnified Parties (as and to the extent defined in
_Section 7.13_ hereof) to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to
_Section 7.13_ hereof, no current or former employee, consultant or director
of the Company, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

terminate any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company (or in which the
Company participates) that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
otherwise directed in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by
Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time or immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
such employee benefit plan.

for a period of six (6) years following the Acceptance Time arising out of
facts or circumstances occurring or existing prior to the Acceptance Time.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that
are at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time, and during such six (6) year period, (x) Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and fulfill in all respects all
obligations pursuant to such provisions, and (y) such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, except as required by
Legal Requirements.

in the form disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring (or
allegedly occurring) at or prior to the Acceptance Time, on terms and
conditions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those of the DandO
Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section 7.13(c)_, (i) the
Surviving Corporation may substitute for the DandO Insurance a policy or
policies of comparable coverage, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred
percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last

Annual Premium_ "); _provided further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the
Acceptance Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may purchase a "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO
Insurance for a period of six (6) years from the Acceptance Time on terms and
conditions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the DandO
Insurance. In the event that the Company shall purchase such a "tail" policy
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 7.13(c)_, for so long
as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then,

beneficiary of this _Section 7.13_, with full rights of enforcement as if a
party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section

indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company, or applicable
Legal Requirements (whether at law or in equity).

 10.3 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements and subject to
the other provisions of this Agreement (including _Section 2.4(d)_ hereof),
this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution
of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Purchaser and
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that this Agreement
has been adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law,
no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that requires the approval of
such Company Stockholders without such approval. No amendment of any provision
of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by each party hereto except as expressly provided herein.

 10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed and except
as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, as applicable, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party hereto contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party hereto contained herein. No such extension or waiver by
any party hereto shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed
by the party providing such extension or waiver, nor shall such extension or
waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant. Any delay in exercising
any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. No
conditions, course of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement
purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of
this Agreement shall be binding unless this Agreement is amended or modified
in writing pursuant to the first sentence of _Section 10.3_.

 

 10.5 _Assignment_. No party hereto may assign either this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties hereto. Subject to the immediately preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 10.6 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are made and
given, and the covenants are agreed to, subject to the disclosures and
exceptions set forth in the sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule corresponding to each such representation and warranty or covenant,
or as otherwise set forth elsewhere in the Company Disclosure Schedule where
it is readily apparent from such disclosure that such information is
applicable to such representation and warranty or covenant. The listing of
any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed to
constitute an admission by the Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material, is required to be disclosed under this Agreement or falls
within  



 

52 ##### Table of Contents

  

 relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any
possible breach or violation of any Contract or Legal Requirement shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. All attachments to the Company Disclosure
Schedule are incorporated by reference into the Company Disclosure Schedule.
The information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is in all events
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments
and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred
to herein, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , Sections 1 through 6 and
Sections 8 through 20 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time
and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms (it being understood that Section 7 of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the "standstill" provisions contained therein,
shall be deemed to have been superseded and terminated as of the date of this
Agreement and shall be of no further force or effect). The Annexes and
Exhibits to this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

 10.8 _Severability_. No provision of this Agreement is to be construed to
require, directly or indirectly, any Person to take any action, or omit to
take any action, to the extent such action or omission would violate
applicable Legal Requirements. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree that any such illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable
provisions shall be limited or eliminated only to the minimum extent necessary
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
that the parties shall replace such provisions of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such provision.

 10.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in or contemplated by
the provisions of _Section 7.13(e)_ hereof, this Agreement shall not confer
any rights or remedies hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 10.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other
remedy that a party hereto may have under law or in equity, any party hereto
shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent any breach of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

 10.11 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, except as expressly provided hereunder, the Company
shall not have any liability or obligation to Parent, Purchaser or any of
their respective Subsidiaries arising under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or otherwise
relating to environmental, health or safety matters.

 10.12 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

 10.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of any state or federal court located within New Castle County,
State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, agrees that all claims
in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby may and shall be heard and determined

commence any Legal Proceedings relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer or the Merger) in
any jurisdiction or courts other than a state or federal court located within
New Castle County, State of Delaware.

 10.14 _Waiver Of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, PURCHASER AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 10.15 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement and hereby waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

 10.16 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties hereto, it
being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and delivered by
facsimile copies, each of which shall be deemed an original.
