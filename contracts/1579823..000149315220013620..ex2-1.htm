are hereby acknowledged, each Party hereby agrees as follows:

  



  

Article 1 
  _MERGER_

  



  

1.1  _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and in accordance with, and subject
to, the terms of this Agreement, the Statement of Merger and the Utah Revised
Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the "URULLCA"), Merger Sub will be
merged with and into the Company (the "Merger") and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. Following the Effective Time,
the Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving
Entity") and will continue to be governed by the URULLCA.

  



  

1.2  _Statement of Merger_. The Merger becomes effective upon the filing by
the Company of a certificate of merger (the "Statement of Merger") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Utah in such form as is required by,
and executed in accordance with, the URULLCA and the terms of this Agreement.
On the Closing Date, the Company will execute the Statement of Merger, and
the Company will file the Statement of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Utah pursuant to this Section 1.2.

  



    


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

1.3  _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger has the effects set forth in the
URULLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be vested in the
Surviving Entity, and all debts, obligations and other Liabilities of the
Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, obligations and other
Liabilities of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

1.4  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Organization and Operating Agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time, will be the Certificate of Organization and
Operating Agreement, respectively, of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

  



  

1.5  _Managers and Officers of the Surviving Entity_. The managers of Merger
Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the managers of the
Surviving Entity at the Effective Time, until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately
before the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Entity at the
Effective Time, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

  



  

1.6  _Effect on Equity Interests_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, the
following will occur:

  



  

(a) Each membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time will be converted into one membership interest of
the Surviving Entity, which will be the only membership interest of the
Surviving Entity issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Each Membership Interest owned directly or indirectly by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, if any, will cease to exist and cease to be outstanding
and will be canceled and no consideration will be paid or delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) Membership Interests issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (other than any Membership Interest described in Section
1.6(b), which Membership Interest is subject to the terms of such Section)
will cease to exist and cease to be outstanding and will be canceled, and
each holder thereof will thereafter be entitled to receive with respect to
each of such holder's share of the Merger Consideration, upon and subject to
the terms herein.

  



  

1.7  _Payment of Merger Consideration_. Payment of the Cash Consideration (as
defined below) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
or certified or cashier's check, as properly stated in Payment Schedule (as
defined below).

  



  

1.8  _Payment to Certain Persons_. If payment or delivery of payment is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a certificate
representing Membership Interests surrendered pursuant hereto is registered,
it will be a condition of such payment or delivery that the certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment or delivery either pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment or delivery or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

  



    

2 
--- 

 



    



  

1.9  _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate representing Membership Interests, the holder thereof may be
required, as a condition precedent to the delivery to such holder of the
consideration described herein, to deliver to the Surviving Entity a written
affidavit and indemnity agreement in form and substance acceptable to the
Surviving Entity as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Entity with respect to such certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.10  _No Further Ownership Rights or Transfers_. The Merger Consideration,
when paid in accordance with this _Article 1_ and _Article 2_ , will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights regarding the
Membership Interests. At and after the Effective Time, the transfer books of
the Surviving Entity will be closed with respect to the Membership
Interests of the Company, and there will be no further registration of
transfers of the Membership Interests of the Company thereafter on the
records of the Surviving Entity. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section
1.8, each certificate representing Membership Interests will be deemed, at
and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the consideration contemplated by Section 1.6(c), subject to the
terms herein.

  



  

Article 2 
  _MERGER CONSIDERATION AND CLOSING_

  



  

2.1  _Merger Consideration_. Upon and subject to the terms herein, at
Closing, Parent shall pay to Sellers the Merger Consideration, as such amount
is adjusted under this Agreement. "Merger Consideration" means:

  



  

(a) the Cash Consideration;

  



  

(b) the Stock Consideration;

  



  

(c) Six-Month Convertible Notes; and

  



  

(d) Two-Year Convertible Notes.

  



  

2.2  _Calculation of Merger Consideration_. On or before the fifth Business
Day before the Closing Date, Sellers and the Company shall deliver to Parent
a schedule (the "Payment Schedule") setting forth (A) each Member's share of
the Cash Consideration, (B) the amount of the Stock Consideration due to each
Seller, in each case taking into account the Cash Consideration paid by the
Parent to each Member for such Member's respective Membership Interests in the
Company as described on the Payment Schedule and (C) each Member's share of
the Convertible Notes. Sellers and the Company shall consider in good faith,
and consult with Parent regarding, any comments on the Closing Merger
Consideration Calculation Statement that are submitted by Parent on or before
the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent and its Affiliates have no liability for any allocation of the Merger
Consideration (including the cash, equity and debt components) among the
Members as set forth in the Payment Schedule and each Seller confirms that the
Payment Schedule reflects the agreed upon distribution of the Merger
Consideration and consideration to be paid by Parent among the Members
regardless of any inconsistencies with the Company's Organizational
Documents.

  



    

3 
--- 

 



    



  

2.3  _Closing_. Subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions
precedent set forth in Article 7, the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices
of Faegre Drinker Biddle and Reath LLP, at 1144 15th Street, Suite 3400,
Denver, Colorado, at 2:00 p.m. (local time) on a date (the "Closing Date") to
be mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Parent, which date will be no later
than the third Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article
7 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their
terms are intended to be satisfied at Closing). Documents may be delivered at
the Closing by electronic delivery, and the receiving Party may rely on the
receipt of such documents so delivered as if the original had been received.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all proceedings to be taken
and all documents to be executed at the Closing will be deemed to have been
taken, delivered, and executed simultaneously, and no proceeding will be
deemed taken nor documents deemed executed or delivered until all have been
taken, delivered, and executed. The Closing will be deemed to be effective as
of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time").

  



  

2.4  _Payment of the Merger Consideration_. At Closing, Parent shall:

  



  

(a) cause Parent to issue and deliver to certain Members, in the applicable
Seller's name, in book entry, the Stock Consideration, as determined in
accordance with the Payment Schedule, free and clear of all Encumbrances
(other than those arising under securities Laws and under the Lock-Up
Letter);

  



  

(b) cause Parent to issue and deliver the Convertible Notes to certain
Members and Recipient Employees, in accordance with the Payment Schedule; and

  



  

(c) pay or cause to be paid the Cash Consideration to the Members by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in the amounts and to the accounts
set forth on the Payment Schedule.

  



  

2.5  _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Preparation of the Statement. Within 30 days after the Closing Date,
Parent will prepare and deliver to Sellers Agent a statement (the
"Statement") setting forth, in reasonable detail, Parent's determination of
Closing Working Capital. Sellers Agent shall assist Parent and their
representatives in all reasonable respects in preparing the Statement.
The final determination of Closing Working Capital pursuant to this Section
2.5 is "Final Closing Working Capital."

  



  

(b) Sellers' Response to the Statement. The Closing Working Capital in the
Statement becomes final and binding upon the Parties (and become Final
Closing Working Capital) 30 days after Parent gives the Statement to Sellers
Agent, unless Sellers Agent gives written notice, in reasonable detail, of
its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Parent before the end of
such 30-day period. Sellers Agent may give a Notice of Disagreement only if
(1) assuming all of Sellers Agent's assertions therein were sustained, the
Merger Consideration would be higher than if Sellers Agent had not given such
Notice of Disagreement to Parent and (2) such Notice of Disagreement states
Sellers Agent's determination of Closing Working Capital. The only
disagreements that may be stated in a Notice of Disagreement are those that
relate to any claimed inconsistencies between the principles used in
preparing the Statement and the principles required under this Agreement or
errors in mathematical computation. If Sellers Agent gives a valid Notice of
Disagreement before the end of such 30-day period stated above, then Final
Closing Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with clause (A)
or (B) below) will become final and binding on the Parties upon the earlier
of (A) the date the Parties resolve in writing any differences they have with
respect to all items specified in such Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date
any disputed items are finally resolved in writing by the Arbitrator pursuant
to Section 2.5(c).

  



    

4 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) Resolving Matters. During the 30-day period after a valid Notice of
Disagreement is given, Sellers Agent and Parent shall attempt to resolve in
writing any differences that they have regarding any item in such Notice of
Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Sellers Agent and Parent
have not reached agreement on all such items, then any Party may require
that the items that remain in dispute be promptly submitted to an arbitrator
(the "Arbitrator") for review and resolution. The Arbitrator will be a public
accounting firm agreed upon by the Parties in writing; provided that the
Arbitrator will not be an accounting firm used by either Sellers or Parent
(or any Affiliate of any of them) within the preceding three years for
audit or valuation purposes. If the Parties cannot agree upon an Arbitrator
within five Business Days after first attempting to do so, then the
Arbitrator will be selected by lot from a list of four potential Arbitrators
remaining after Sellers nominate three, Parent nominates three, and Sellers
and Parent each eliminate one potential Arbitrator from the other's
nominations. The Arbitrator will determine procedures for such arbitration,
subject to the terms hereof. The Arbitrator will only consider the items that
remain in dispute. The Arbitrator will render a decision resolving such items
in dispute within 30 days after completion of submissions to the Arbitrator.
The Arbitrator will determine Final Closing Working Capital solely based on
submissions made by Sellers and Parent consistent with the terms hereof (and
not by independent review). The Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any
item that is greater than the greater value for such item claimed by either
Sellers or Parent or less than the lesser value for such item claimed by
either Sellers or Parent.

  



  

(d) Allocation of Fees and Expenses. Each Party shall pay its own fees and
expenses regarding such arbitration and half of the fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator.

  



  

(e) Reconciliation Payment. Within five Business Days after Final Closing
Working Capital becomes final and binding on the Parties (or, for any payment
or disbursement to any Seller who at such time has not yet complied with
Section 2.4, within five Business Days after such compliance), the following
will occur (with the payments in this Section being made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds):

  



  

(i) if the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Closing
Working Capital (such deficit, a "Working Capital Deficit"), the Parent shall
set off an amount equal to the Working Capital Deficit from the principal
amount payable by it under the Six-Month Convertible Notes; and

  



  

(ii) if the Final Closing Working Capital is more than the Target Closing

Company. The Company has full corporate power and authority to own and lease
its properties and assets and conduct its business as now conducted. Other
than the Company's direct ownership of the Company Subsidiaries, the Company
does not hold any equity interest, directly or indirectly, of any

or any Company Subsidiary to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem any
shares, units, membership interests, partnership interests, or other equity
interests of its equity interests or to grant any options, calls, warrants or
convertible or exchangeable securities, or conversion, preemptive,
subscription, or other rights, or agreements, arrangements or commitments.
There are no shares, units, membership interests, partnership interests, or
other equity interests of equity interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary reserved for issuance. There are no capital appreciation rights,
restricted stock or equity, performance-based stock or other equity, dividend

this Agreement or restrictions on transfer imposed by Applicable Laws. Other
than the Company's ownership of the equity interests of the Company
Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries owns,
holds or controls, directly or indirectly, any equity, partnership,
membership or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into,
exercisable for the purchase of or exchangeable for any such equity,
partnership, membership or similar interest in, any Person. There are no
declared or accrued unpaid dividends or distributions with respect to any
shares, units, membership interests, partnership interests, or other equity
interests of equity interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, any of its presently
outstanding shares, units, membership interests, partnership interests, or

each Real Property Lease, subject to any Enforcement Limitation. No Real
Property Lease imposes any restriction that prevents or materially interferes
with the operation of the Business conducted at such Leased Real Property.
Neither the Company is in default or otherwise in breach under any Real
Property Lease and, to the Company's Knowledge, no other party is in default
or otherwise in breach thereof. Seller has provided to Parent a true, correct
and complete copy of each Real Property Lease (including without limitation
all amendments and supplements thereto and all estoppel certificates,
subordination and non-disturbance agreements and similar instruments that
would preclude assertion of any claim under any Real Property Lease, affect
any right or obligation under any Real Property Lease or otherwise be
binding upon any successor to the Company's position under any Real Property
Lease). Each Real Property Lease is in full force and effect and constitutes

properties and assets and conduct its business. Parent is duly qualified and
in good standing to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction

this Agreement and each Ancillary Document by Parent and Merger Sub has been
duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action or limited

making of filings and submissions referenced in the next sentence, neither
the execution nor delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or of any
Ancillary Document nor consummation by Parent of the transactions
contemplated herein or therein does or will (with or without the passage of
time or giving of notice): (i) constitute a breach of, violate, conflict with
or give rise to or create any right or obligation under any
Organizational Document of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) violate any Applicable
Law; or (iii) constitute a breach or violation of or a default
under, conflict with or give rise to or create any right of any Person other
than Parent or Merger Sub to accelerate, increase, terminate, modify or
cancel any material right or obligation in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub under any Contract to which a Parent or Merger Sub is a party,
except where such a breach, violation, default, conflict or right under clause
(ii) or (iii) above will not materially and adversely affect Parent or Merger
Sub's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. No consent or approval by, notification to or filing with any
Person is required in connection with Parent or Merger Sub's execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document of Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, or the consummation by Parent of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein, except (1) as required by
Antitrust Laws, or (2) for any consent, approval, notice or filing, the
absence of which will not materially and adversely affect the Parent or Merger
Sub's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.3 _Litigation and Orders_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub as of the date
of this Agreement that, if decided adversely to a Parent or Merger Sub, will
materially and adversely affect Parent or Merger Sub's ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent is not subject to an Order that will materially and
adversely affect Parent or Merger Sub's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

  



  

4.4 _Securities_. Parent and Merger Sub are entering into the transactions

"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities
Act and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
transactions under this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub have had access to
sufficient information regarding the Company and its business and condition to
make an informed decision to enter into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

4.5 _Issuance of Shares_. The Stock Consideration to be issued hereunder will
be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable, and free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than those arising under securities Laws and pursuant to
the Lock-Up Letter), and will not be issued in violation of any preemptive
right, purchase option, call option, right of first refusal or similar options
or rights or in violation of the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws. Parent has, and on the Closing Date will have, a sufficient
number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuing the Stock
Consideration. As of May 14, 2020, Parent had 200,000,000 shares of common

other statements, reports, schedules, forms and other documents (including all

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as it may be amended from time to time and
(ii) none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) The Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq").
Parent is in material compliance with the listing standards of Nasdaq. To
Parent's Knowledge, there are no inquiries or investigations by Nasdaq pending
or threatened, in each case regarding the Parent's compliance with Nasdaq
listing standards that may reasonably result in suspension of trading or
delisting of the Common Stock from Nasdaq.

  



  

(c) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Parent SEC Document filed on or prior to the date hereof, all of
Parent's financial statements included in the Parent SEC Documents, in each
case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with the SEC (those filed
with the SEC are collectively referred to as the "Parent Financial
Statements"), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis through the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments which would not reasonably
be expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate). The
consolidated balance sheets (including the related notes) included in such
Parent Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent Parent SEC Document) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof, and the

each case, including the related notes) included in such Parent SEC Documents
(if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a
subsequent SEC Filing) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows of
Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods indicated, subject, in
the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments
which could not reasonably be expected to be material, individually or in the
aggregate.

following the Closing will not be, an "investment company" or a Person
directly or indirectly "controlled" by or acting on behalf of an "investment
company," in each case within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder.

Documents, no employee, officer, director or stockholder of the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or a member of his or her immediate family is indebted for

action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any related legal
restriction, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplate hereby, with the Parties each bearing their own costs; provided,

extent providing such access, assistance or cooperation would unduly
interfere with the business or operations of any of Parent, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, or would, in the reasonable
judgment of Parent or its Affiliates, violate or jeopardize any applicable
attorney-client or other privilege or any applicable contractual
confidentiality obligation.

5.4 _Further Assurances_. If after Closing any further action is necessary,
proper, or desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each
Party shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
further documents) as any other Party reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing is at the expense of such requesting Party, except to
the extent such requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor or
to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates such expense to any other
Party.

  



  

5.5 _Confidentiality and Publicity_.

  



  

(a) Nondisclosure Agreement. Subject to the other terms of this Section 5.5,
each Party acknowledges that the information being furnished or made
available to it in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement between Parent and the Company,
dated as of June 1, 2020 (the "Nondisclosure Agreement"), the terms of which
are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
Closing, the Nondisclosure Agreement will terminate with respect to
information relating exclusively to the Company.

  



  

(b) Effective as of Closing, Sellers shall treat and hold as such all of the
Confidential Information, refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement, and
deliver promptly to Parent or destroy, at the option of Parent, all tangible
embodiments (and all copies) of the Confidential Information that are in their
possession, except for a securely maintained electronically archived copy the
return or destruction of which is not practicable. In the event that Sellers
are requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential
Information, Sellers shall (to the extent not prohibited by law) notify
Parent reasonably promptly of the request or requirement so that Parent may
seek (at Parent's sole cost and expense) an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.5(b). If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Sellers
are, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, Sellers may
disclose only such Confidential Information to the tribunal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, at the request of Parent (at Parent's sole cost and expense), an
order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Parent
designates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may make disclosures
concerning the Confidential Information (x) to the extent reasonably required
in connection with any Tax Return filed by Sellers, (y) to the extent such
information was or becomes available to such Seller from a third party who is
not known to such Seller to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality with
respect thereto, and (z) to the extent reasonably required during the course
of pursuing or defending in good faith indemnification claims (or the matters
underlying such indemnification claims) or in connection with any dispute
between Parent, on the one hand, and Sellers or Sellers Agent, on the other.
The foregoing provisions will not apply to any Confidential Information that
is generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of
disclosure unless such Confidential Information is so available due to the
wrongful actions of Sellers.

  



    

32 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) Publicity. Parent may issue a press release and file a Current Report on
Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with
the signing of this Agreement, subject to the approval of Sellers Agent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Except for such
press release and Current Report on Form 8-K, none of Parent, Sellers, the
Company or their respective Affiliates will issue any press release or make
any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
prior to Closing without the prior approval of Sellers Agent and Parent,
except as may be required by Applicable Law. Following the Closing, none of
Sellers nor their respective Affiliates will issue any press release or make
any public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
without the prior written approval of Parent, except as may be required by
Applicable Law.

  



  

5.6 _Employee Matters_. Without limiting Section 9.4, (i) no Company Plan or
other employee benefit or arrangement is or will be deemed to be amended by
any term hereof and (ii) no Person, including any employee (or dependent or
beneficiary thereof) of the Company or participant in any Company Plan, is a
third party beneficiary of any term of this Section 5.6. Nothing in this
Section 5.6 obligates the Parent or any of its Affiliates to continue the
employment of any employee of the Company or any of Company Subsidiary
following the Closing for any specific period or in any specific level of
employment, except as may be required by Applicable Law.

  



  

5.7 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Filing Responsibility. Sellers shall timely prepare and file or cause the
Company to timely prepare and file at the expense of the Sellers all Tax
Returns of or including the Company that are required to be filed (with
extensions) on or before the Closing Date and to pay all Taxes shown as due
on any such Tax Return. All such Tax Returns will be made and filed by the
Sellers or the Company in a manner consistent with the most recent prior
practice of the Company and with Applicable Law. Sellers Agent will, at
the expense of Sellers, prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. Each party (or parties) responsible for preparing and filing
any Income Tax Return pursuant to this Section 5.7(a), shall provide drafts
of such Income Tax Return to the other parties a reasonable time prior to
filing and consider in good faith any reasonable comments of the other party
(or parties) in respect of such Income Tax Return. The parties shall cooperate
in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to any such Income Tax
Return and if the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute at least
ten days before the due date (including extensions) for any such Income Tax
Return, the dispute shall be referred to an Arbitrator and any such
determination by such Arbitrator shall be final. If any such dispute is not
resolved by such Arbitrator prior to the due date (including extensions) for
any such Income Tax Return, such Income Tax Return shall be filed as
originally prepared and later amended to reflect the such Arbitrator's
determination, if necessary. The expenses of such Arbitrator shall be borne
equally by Parent and Sellers.

  



  

(b) Cooperation. Parent, Sellers, Sellers Agent and the Company shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
pursuant to this Section 5.7 and the defense of any audit, litigation or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company. Sellers and Parent
agree to, and to cause the Company to (i) abide by any and all record
retention requirements of, or record retention agreements entered into with,
any Tax authority and (ii) retain (and provide the other Party and its
Affiliates with reasonable access to) all records or information which may be
relevant to the preparation of any Tax Return or claim for refund and the
defense of any audit, litigation or Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company. The party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other
for any reasonable out of pocket costs incurred in providing any information
pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) and shall compensate the other party for any
reasonable costs (excluding wages, salaries and related costs) of making
personnel available, upon receipt of reasonable documentation of such costs.
To the extent that action by Sellers, Parent or any company controlled by
Sellers or Parent is required by Applicable Laws or administrative
pronouncements in order to extend any statute of limitation for any Tax Return
or Proceeding described above in this Section 5.7(b), such party will take
such action as is necessary to extend a statute of limitations where such
extension is reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the
preparation by such other party of such Tax Return or defense by such other
party of such Proceeding.

  



    

33 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) Straddle Period. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods will (i) in the case of any real or
personal property Taxes or similar ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the
Closing Date

  



  

(d) Transfer Taxes. Sellers, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other, will
pay half of all Transfer Taxes, if any, and Sellers and Parent shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports, and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of Applicable Law relating thereto.

  



  

(e) IP Shift. Sellers, the Company, and Parent shall cooperate with Parent's
tax accountants to determine if the transfer of Intellectual Property to
Ariix, Inc. in 2020 (the "IP Shift") is the optimal structure to hold the
Intellectual Property after Closing. If reasonably recommended by such tax
accountants and requested by Parent prior to Closing, Sellers and the Company
shall cause the IP Shift to be unwound or otherwise transfer the Intellectual
Property to another Affiliate of the Company in accordance with Parent's
request. Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable, actual out-of-
pocket legal or accounting expenses associated with such unwinding or
transfer. If requested under this subsection, the unwinding or transfer
automatically becomes a condition to Closing.

  



  

(f) Overlap. To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 5.7 and
Article 8, this Section 5.7 controls as to Tax matters.

  



  

5.8 _No Shop_. Throughout the period that begins on the date hereof and ends
upon the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.3, Sellers or the Company shall not, and Sellers shall
cause the Company and each authorized representative or agent of Sellers or
the Company not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, seek, or
encourage any inquiry, proposal, or offer from, furnish any information to,
or participate in any discussion or negotiation or enter into any agreement
with any Person (other than Parent or any Person on their behalf) regarding
any acquisition of a substantial portion of the Company's equity interests,
assets, or business, in whole or in part (by purchase, merger, tender offer,
statutory share exchange, joint venture or otherwise), except the sales of
inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company. Sellers and the
Company shall, and shall cause each the Company and each authorized
representative or agent of any Seller or the Company to, immediately
terminate all such discussions or negotiations that may be in progress on the
date hereof.

5.9 _Sellers Agent_.

  



  

(a) Without any further act of any Seller, Sellers Agent is hereby
irrevocably appointed as agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact for each
Seller with full power of substitution or resubstitution, solely for the
purposes set forth herein, such appointment being coupled with an interest
and irrevocable. Sellers Agent will act as the representative of each Seller,
and is authorized to act on behalf of each Seller under this Agreement, or
any other Ancillary Document or in connection with any transaction
contemplated herein or therein, including (i) the power to contest,
negotiate, defend, compromise, or settle any adjustments under Section 5.7
and any indemnification claims under this Agreement or any other Ancillary
Document for which Parent or its Other Indemnified Persons may be entitled to
indemnification, (ii) the power to execute any agreement or instrument in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Ancillary Documents, including under Section 6.3, (iii) the power to give or
receive any notice or instruction permitted or required under this Agreement
or any other Ancillary Document, to be given or received by any Seller,
including receipt of any notice or service of process in connection with any
claim under this Agreement (all of which will be deemed delivered or served
upon all Sellers upon delivery to Sellers Agent), (iv) the power to review,
negotiate, and agree to and authorize any payments in satisfaction of any
payment obligation, in each case, on behalf of Sellers, and (v) the power to
take any actions in regard to such other matters as are reasonably necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as
Sellers Agent reasonably believes are in the best interests of Sellers taken
as a whole. Each Seller will be bound by all actions taken by Sellers Agent
in his capacity thereof. Neither Sellers Agent nor any of his agents or
employees will be liable to any Person for any error of judgment, or any
action taken, suffered, or omitted to be taken, under this Agreement, except
in the case of its bad faith or willful misconduct. Sellers Agent may consult
with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected
by him and will not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in
good faith by Sellers Agent in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants, or experts. As to any matters not expressly provided for in this
Agreement, Sellers Agent will not be required to exercise any discretion or
take any action. Each Seller will indemnify and hold harmless and reimburse
Sellers Agent from and against such Seller's pro rata share (computed on the
basis of its pro rata share of the Merger Consideration) of any and all
Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, or expenses suffered or incurred
by Sellers Agent arising out of, relating to or resulting from any action
taken or omitted to be taken by Sellers Agent under this Agreement, other
than such Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arising
out of, relating to or resulting from Sellers Agent's bad faith or willful
misconduct. In all matters relating to this Section, Sellers Agent will be
the only party entitled to assert the rights of Sellers. Notwithstanding the
following sentence, Parent may rely on all statements, actions,
representations, and decisions of Sellers Agent as being the binding acts of
all Sellers or any of them, notwithstanding any communication from any Seller
to the contrary (other than any communication regarding termination or
replacement of Sellers Agent pursuant to this Section 5.9). By executing and
delivering this Agreement, each Seller confirms and ratifies all that Sellers
Agent will do or cause to be done in good faith as Sellers Agent.

  



  

(b) Sellers Agent may resign upon written notice to Sellers. Sellers Agent
may be changed or replaced by vote of a majority of Sellers who have voting
membership interests in the Company prior to Closing ("Voting Sellers") upon
written notice to Sellers Agent and Parent. Any vacancy in the position of
Sellers Agent may be filled by approval of a majority of Voting Sellers. No
bond will be required of Sellers Agent.

  



  

(c) Sellers Agent has no power or authority to bind Parent or Merger Sub, and
Parent and Merger Sub have no Liability to any Person for any act or omission
by Sellers Agent.

  



  

5.10 _Employees_. Effective as of the Closing, the Parent shall enter into
employment agreements with the employees listed on Schedule 5.10
(the "Employment Agreements").

  



  

5.11 _Indebtedness_. Sellers and the Company shall cause all Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than forgivable loans under
the Paycheck Protection Program) to be repaid on or before the Closing.

own behalf or on behalf of any Person, directly or indirectly, solicit or
encourage any employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or

such persons.

  



  

(v) During the Non-Compete Period, the Sellers shall not, whether on their
own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Person, directly or
indirectly, hire any employee who was employed by the Company or any of the

Subsidiary's management, policies, operations, products, services or
practices in a manner that has or would reasonably have a material and adverse
effect on the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  



  

(vii) In the event a Seller violates any of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.12(a), the Sellers understand and agree that the breaching Seller
will be liable to Parent, the Company or their Affiliates for any damage
caused by such Seller's violation, including attorney fees and expenses. In
addition to any other relief available to the Company in event of a breach,
the Company may obtain equitable relief in the form of temporary and
permanent injunction and, where applicable, damages at law. Such damages may
be set-off against amounts otherwise due to such Seller from any of Parent,
the Company or their Subsidiaries or their Affiliates or their respective
successor and assigns.

  



  

(viii) If any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction
contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be
amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding will not affect the
enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.

  



  

(b) Release.

executors, administrators, legal representatives and trusts (as applicable),

 _INDEMNIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES_

  



  

8.1 _Indemnification of Parent_. Subject to the other terms of this Article
8, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Parent and their Other Indemnified Persons from and against all
Losses and shall pay to Parent and their Other Indemnified Persons the amount
of such Losses to the extent arising or resulting from, related to, or in
connection with, any of the following:

  



  

(a) any Third Party Claims resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by any Seller or the Company contained in
Article 3 of this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of any Seller or the Company
contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(c) Pre-Closing Taxes of the Company;

  



  

(d) fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or willful breach by the Company or
the Sellers;

  



  

(e) any of the matters listed on Schedule 8.1(e); or

  



  

(f) any Proceeding incident to any of the foregoing.

  



  

8.2 _Indemnification of Sellers_. Subject to the other terms of this Article
8, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless Sellers and their respective Other Indemnified Persons from and
against all Losses of Sellers and shall pay to Sellers and their Other
Indemnified Persons the amount of such Losses to the extent arising or
resulting from or in connection with any of the following:

  



  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Parent contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this

(c) fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or willful breach by Parent; or

  



  

(d) any Proceeding incident to any of the foregoing.

  



  

8.3 _Matters Regarding Claims_.

  



  

(a) Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that each other
Party will be damaged irreparably if this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms or otherwise is breached and that, in addition to
its other rights under this Agreement and Applicable Law, a Party will be
entitled to an injunction and other equitable relief (without posting any bond
or other security) to prevent breaches hereof and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and its terms in addition to any other remedy to which
such Party may be entitled hereunder. In particular, each Party recognizes
and affirms that in the event any Sellers breach this Agreement, money
damages may be inadequate and Parent would have no adequate remedy at law, so
that Parent may, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its
favor, to seek enforcement of its rights and each other Party's obligations
hereunder not only by action for damages but also by action for specific
performance, injunctive or other equitable relief.

  



    

43 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) No Double Recovery. Any Claiming Party will only be entitled to recover
the full amount of a Loss once with respect to any item giving rise to a
Loss.

  



  

(c) Materiality. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
for purposes of determining whether there is an inaccuracy or that there has
been a breach of any representation or warranty for purposes of Section 8.1(a)
and for calculating Losses in connection therewith, no effect shall be given
to any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" and
phrases of similar import contained in any representation or warranty made in
Article 3.

  



  

(d) Claims Pursuant to Governing Documents. The Sellers are not entitled to,
and shall not seek to, recover from Parent, the Company and Other Indemnified
Persons pursuant to claims afforded to such Seller pursuant to the bylaws or
other governing or constituting documents of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary or any similar indemnification or contribution right with respect
to any amounts paid by any Seller.

  



  

(e) Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
each Party and any Person's rights to indemnification with respect thereto
are not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or
on behalf of such Person (including by any of his, her or its advisors,
consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that such Person or
any of such advisors, consultants or representatives knew or should have
known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification or other
remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations.
All representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements herein will be
deemed material and relied upon by each Party, and none will be waived by any
failure to pursue any action or by consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(f) Sellers Agent. For purposes of this Article 8, any references to the
Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to Sellers Agent when Sellers are the
Indemnifying Parties. Sellers Agent shall have full power and authority on
behalf of each Seller Indemnitor to take any and all actions on behalf of,
execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and
all rights of, Seller Indemnitors under this Article 8.

  



  

(g) No Special Losses. No Party is obligated to any other Person for any
special, speculative, exemplary, or punitive damages or Losses based thereon,
including regarding loss of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of
value or loss of business reputation or opportunity, and no Party is
obligated to any other Person for any Loss determined as a multiple of income,
revenue or the like, relating to the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement herein; provided, however, that the foregoing does not
apply to: (i) any obligation under Section 8.1 other than under Section
8.1(a); (ii) any breach of Section 5.5 or Section 5.12; or (iii) any Third
Party Claim.

  



  

(h) Certain Limitations Regarding Claims.

Sellers Threshold, then Sellers are obligated for all of such
Losses (including those equal to or less than the Seller Threshold), subject
to the other terms of this Article 8.

  



    

44

(iii) Certain Treatment of Special Representations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing terms of this Section, (1) Sections 8.3(h)(i) and (ii) do not limit
any Liability with respect to any Seller Fundamental Representation, and (2)
the amount of Losses hereunder with respect to any Seller Fundamental
Representation will not be used in determining if the Threshold or Cap has
been reached or exceeded.

  



  

(iv) Special Indemnification. The limitations regarding Claims set forth on
Schedule 8.1(e) apply to Claims under Section 8.1(e).

  



  

(v) Threshold on Parent's Obligations. Parent has no obligation under Section

Threshold, then Parent is obligated for all of such Losses (including those
equal to or less than the Parent Threshold), subject to the other terms of
this Article 8.

  



  

(vi) Cap on Parent's Obligations. Parent's obligations under Section 8.2(a),
in the aggregate, will not exceed an amount equal to $25,000,000, subject to
the other terms of this Article 8.

  



  

8.4 _Certain Survival Periods_.

  



  

(a) Survival of Representations and Warranties and Pre-Closing Covenants.
Subject to Section 8.4(b), each representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in this Agreement
that do not expressly survive the Closing, will survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect until the date
that is 24 months after the Closing Date (the "General Indemnity Survival
Date"), at which time such representation, warranty, covenant, and agreement
will expire and terminate and no indemnification obligation will be associated
therewith or based thereon; provided, however that the Seller Fundamental
Representations survive for six years after the Closing Date and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.5 survive until the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the underlying subject
matter of such representations and warranties, plus 30 days.

  



  

(b) Survival of Post-Closing Covenants and Agreements. Each covenant and
agreement ( _i.e._ , other than representations and warranties) in this
Agreement that expressly survives the Closing, and all associated rights to
indemnification, will survive Closing in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(c) Claims for Indemnification. No Party will be liable under this Article 8
for any Losses suffered by (i) any Seller or any of its Other Indemnified
Persons or (ii) Parent or any of its Other Indemnified Persons, as applicable,
arising out of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement contained in this Agreement unless a claim therefor is asserted in
writing prior to the expiration of the survival period described in clauses
(a) and (b) above in accordance with Section 8.5. Each claim for
indemnification under this Agreement regarding a representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement that is validly made in accordance with Section 8.5
before expiration of the applicable survival period will not terminate before
final determination and satisfaction of such claim.

  



 

    

45 
--- 

 



    



 

8.5  _Notice of Claims and Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Notice of Claims. A Party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the
"Claiming Party") will give the Party obligated to provide such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt notice of any claim,
for which such Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification, (i) by a
Person that is not a Party nor an Other Indemnified Person (such a claim
being a "Third Party Claim" and such notice of such Third Party Claim being
the "Initial Claim Notice") or (ii) that does not involve a Third Party
Claim, in each case specifying the amount and nature of, and basis for, such
claim (in each case, to the extent known). Thereafter, the Claiming Party will
give the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Claiming Party's (or any of
its applicable Other Indemnified Person's) receipt or delivery
thereof, copies of all documents (including court papers) received or
delivered by the Claiming Party (or any such Other Indemnified
Person) relating to any such Third Party Claim. The failure to promptly give
such notice or to promptly give such copies will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any Liability hereunder, except if the Indemnifying Party was
prejudiced thereby, but only to the extent of such prejudice.

  



  

(b) Access and Cooperation. Each Party will, and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons to, cooperate and assist in all reasonable respects
regarding such Third Party Claim, including by promptly making available to
such other Party (and its legal counsel and other professional advisers with
a reasonable need to know) all books and records of such Person relating to
such Third Party Claim, subject to reasonable confidentiality precautions.

  



  

(c) Defense and Participation Regarding Third Party Claims. This Section
8.5(c) relates to Third Party Claims.

  



  

(i) Election to Conduct Defense. Promptly after receiving an Initial Claim
Notice under Section 8.5(a), the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense
of such Third Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. To elect
to conduct such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice of
such election to the Claiming Party within 20 days after the Claiming
Party gives the corresponding Initial Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(ii) Conduct of Defense, Participation and Settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim, then (1) the Claiming
Party may participate, at its own expense, in such defense (including any
Proceeding regarding such Third Party Claim) and will have the right to
receive copies of all notices, pleadings or other similar submissions
regarding such defense, (2) each Party shall keep the other Party reasonably
informed of all matters material to such defense and Third Party Claim at all
stages thereof, (3) the Claiming Party shall not (and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons not to) admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or
settle, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) and (4) the
Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle such Third Party
Claim, without the consent of the Claiming Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld), if such compromise or settlement (A) provides for (x)
relief other than monetary damages or (y) monetary damages if the Indemnifying
Party has not acknowledged in writing that it shall be solely responsible for
such monetary damages, (B) involves any material limitation on any future
operations of the Claiming Party (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons) or
(C) does not irrevocably release the Claiming Party (and any applicable Other
Indemnified Person) from all Liability regarding such Third Party Claim, other
than any monetary Liability being satisfied by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Claiming Party reasonably
believes that a conflict of interest exists in respect of a Third Party Claim
or if the defendants in, or targets of, any such action or Proceeding include
both the Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Claiming Party has
reasonably concluded upon advice of counsel that there may be legal defenses
available to it or to other Indemnified Parties that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, then, in each case,
the Claiming Party may retain separate counsel selected by the Claiming Party
to represent the Claiming Party in the defense of such Third Party Claim and
the reasonable fees and expenses of the Claiming Party in connection
therewith shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

  



    

46 
--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Indemnifying Party Does Not Conduct Defense. If the Indemnifying Party
does not validly elect to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, then
the Claiming Party may conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Claiming
Party in connection therewith, and the Claiming Party may compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim after receiving the consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

8.6  _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) Once a Loss is mutually agreed upon by the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party or is finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this
Article 8 (each, a "Payable Loss"):

  



  

(i) If the Indemnified Party is Parent or Merger Sub, Parent shall set off an
amount equal to the Payable Loss from the amounts payable by it under the
Six-Month Convertible Notes to the extent amounts owed under the Six-Month
Convertible Notes are adequate to set off such Payable Loss and Parent shall
set off any remaining Payable Loss from the amounts payable by it under the
Two-Year Convertible Notes.

  



  

(ii) If the Indemnified Party is a Seller, Parent shall add an amount equal
to the Payable Loss to the principal amount payable by it under the Two-Year
Convertible Notes.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, except (i) for all equitable remedies under
this Agreement, (ii) obligations relating to Taxes under Section 5.7, or
(iii) in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or intentional
breach, the indemnification provided for under this Article 8 is the sole and
exclusive remedy of the parties, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise,
for all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including for any inaccuracy or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein or in any
certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any claim for fraud may only be made against
the Person who commits such fraud.

8.7  _No Indemnification for Breaches of Representations and Warranties
Except for Third Party Claims._ Except in connection with Third Party Claims,
Sellers have no obligations to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless under
Section 8.1(a).

  



  

8.8  _Indemnification Adjusts Merger Consideration for Tax Purposes_. Each
Party shall, including retroactively, treat indemnification payments under
this Agreement as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes to
the extent permitted under Applicable Law.

9.7  _Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule, other Schedules and Exhibits, constitutes the entire
Agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter herein and
supersedes any other existing representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
or similar assurance (whether direct or indirect, written or oral, or
statutory, express or implied) of any Party regarding such subject matter
(and there is no other representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or
similar assurance of any Party regarding such subject matter). No supplement,
modification or amendment hereof will be binding unless expressed as such and
executed in writing by each Party. Except to the extent as may otherwise be
stated herein, no waiver of any term hereof will be binding unless expressed
as such in a document executed by the Party making such waiver (and then
only to the extent so expressed). No waiver of any term hereof will be a
waiver of any other term hereof, whether or not similar, nor will any such
waiver be a continuing waiver beyond its stated terms. Except to the extent as

term hereof will not be a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any existing

9.9  _Severability; Blue-Pencil_. If any term of this Agreement is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, then all other terms of this Agreement will nevertheless
remain in full force and effect, and such term automatically will be amended
so that it is valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Law, but as close to the Parties' original intent as is
permissible.
