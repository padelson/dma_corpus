each of the Parties shall be entitled to rescind from this Agreement
(Rucktritt vom Vertrag) by written notice to the respective other Party with a
copy to the acting notary provided that (i) the Sellers may exercise such
right to rescind only jointly and (ii) such rescission may not be sought by a
Party if the non-occurrence of the Closing is due to a grossly negligent or
intentional (grob fahrlassig oder vorsatzlich) failure of such Party to comply
with its respective obligations under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

8.2

|

In the event that the Transaction should not have been authorized by the
competent cartel authorities specified in clause 6.1 (a) within a period of 50

granted in clause 8.1 shall arise only in the event that Closing has not
occurred within six (6) months after Signing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

If this Agreement is rescinded in accordance with this clause 8, this
Agreement shall cease to have force and effect and shall not create any

in this clause 8, clause 16 (Guarantee), clause 19 (Confidentiality), clause
20 (Costs and Taxes), clause 23 (Notices), clause 24 (Applicable Law;
Arbitration) and clause 25 (Other Provisions) shall remain in full force and
effect. 

| 
---|--- 

8.4

|

Upon rescission, any of the Parties\' claims shall be excluded as far as this
is legally permissible except that Purchaser shall be liable for the Sellers\'
damages arising from the non-occurrence of Closing due to non-fulfilment of
the Closing Condition specified in clause 6.1 (a) if the Purchaser has grossly
negligently or intentionally (grob fahrlassig oder vorsatzlich) failed to duly
and timely provide correct and complete information to the EU Commission, the
German Federal Cartel Office or any other authorities to which the merger
envisaged by the Transaction is notified.

Determination of Final Shares Purchase Price 

| 
---|--- 

9.1

|

The Final Shares Purchase Price shall be equal to 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Enterprise Value; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

minus any positive amount of Net Debt Balance as of the Closing Date (the
Final Net Debt Balance) or plus any negative amount of Final Net Debt Balance,
as the case may be; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

minus the amount of EUR 14,264,972.39 (in words: fourteen million two hundred
and sixty four thousand nine hundred seventy two 39/100 Euro) to be paid by
the Purchaser pursuant to clause 7.2 (c) at Closing; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

plus any positive amount of Closing Working Capital Adjustment or minus any
negative amount of Closing Working Capital Adjustment, as the case may be. 

| 
---|--- 

9.2

|

For purposes of determination of the Final Net Debt Balance and the Closing
Working Capital Adjustment, the Purchaser shall without delay, however in no
event later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, cause the
Company to prepare in accordance with US generally accepted accounting
principles and, to the 

extent in line with US generally accepted accounting principles, consistent
with the practice as reflected in Schedule 18, the Closing Date Accounts and
to deliver them to the Parties together with a calculation of the Final Shares
Purchase Price in accordance with clause 9.1. For the determination of the
Final Net Debt Balance and the Closing Working Capital Adjustment, the numbers
contained in the Closing Date Accounts (as amended pursuant to the provisions
in clause 9.3 and/or 9.4 to be the Final Closing Date Accounts) shall be
relevant. The calculation shall be made in accordance with the principles set
forth in the last three sentences of clause 4.2.

| 
---|--- 

9.3

|

If the Sellers do not object within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of
the Closing Date Accounts or confirm their agreement, those Closing Date
Accounts shall be deemed to be approved as final and binding between the
Parties. If and to the extent the Sellers do object and the Parties do not
reach agreement within 20 (twenty) Business Days after such objections, all
items in dispute shall, pursuant to clause 9.4, be referred to the Expert
Arbitrator (as defined below) who shall decide on the issues with binding
effect for the Parties (the accounts as deemed final or as decided upon by the
Expert Arbitrator the Final Closing Date Accounts). 

| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

The expert arbitrator shall be a public accountant (Wirtschaftsprufer)
admitted to practice in Germany appointed jointly by the Sellers and the
Purchaser. If an agreement on the appointment cannot be reached within ten
(10) Business Days after the end of the 20 Business Day period referred to in
clause 9.3, the Expert Arbitrator shall be appointed upon request of the
Sellers and/or the Purchaser, as the case may be, by the President of the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer in Deutschland e.V. (IDW) in Dusseldorf (such
expert arbitrator so appointed the Expert Arbitrator). 

The Expert Arbitrator shall be bound by those items which neither the Sellers
nor the Purchaser have objected to or on which the Sellers and the Purchaser
have agreed; in its decision on the points in dispute the Expert Arbitrator
shall not go beyond the range of difference of opinions between the Sellers
and the Purchaser on each individual item. The Expert Arbitrator shall give
both the Sellers and the Purchaser an opportunity to present their position on
the disputed items.

The Expert Arbitrator shall then amend the Closing Date Accounts to reflect
(i) the adjustments, if any, on which the Sellers and the Purchaser have
agreed and (ii) those adjustments which the Expert Arbitrator has decided in
the absence of agreement between the Sellers and the Purchaser. The Closing
Date Accounts so amended by the Expert Arbitrator shall, for purposes of this
Agreement, be final and binding upon the Parties and be deemed the Final
Closing Date Accounts.

All costs and expenses of the Expert Arbitrator and of the proceedings
thereunder shall be advanced by the Sellers on the one hand and the Purchaser
on the other hand in equal amounts. Each of the Sellers and Purchaser shall
bear its own costs and the costs of its advisers and counsel, except to the
extent that the Expert Arbitrator decides otherwise. The Expert Arbitrator may
decide in its equitable discretion upon the final allocation of its costs and
expenses as well as the costs and expenses of the proceedings hereunder
between the Sellers and/or the Purchaser, including reasonable fees and
expenses of the Sellers and the Purchaser and their advisers and counsel in
these proceedings, taking into account the decision and the original positions
and motions of the Sellers and the Purchaser and applying, mutatis mutandis,
Sec. 91 et seq. of the German Civil Procedure Code (Zivilprozessordnung). 

| 
---|--- 

9.5

|

Any difference between the Preliminary Shares Purchase Price and the Final
Shares Purchase Price (such difference amount the Adjustment Amount) plus
interest at a rate of 5 % p.a. since the Closing Date until and including the
date of payment shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the Final Closing
Date Accounts have been delivered to the Parties, be payable by Purchaser to
the Seller 1 (if the Final Shares Purchase Price is higher than the
Preliminary Shares Purchase Price) or by the Seller 1 to the Purchaser (if the
Final Shares Purchase Price is lower than the Preliminary Shares Purchase
Price). 

| 
---|--- 

9.6

|

The Final Loan Purchase Price shall be the principal amount of the Shareholder
Loan plus accrued interest until and including the Closing Date, both as shown
in the Final Closing Date Accounts. Any difference between the Preliminary
Loan Purchase Price and the Final Loan Purchase Price (such difference amount
the Loan Adjustment Amount) plus interest at a rate of 5 % p.a. since the
Closing Date until and including the date of payment shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after the Final Closing Date Accounts have been delivered to the
Parties, be payable by the Purchaser to the Seller 2 (if the Final Loan
Purchase Price is higher than the Preliminary Loan Purchase Price) or by the
Seller 2 to the Purchaser (if the Final Loan Purchase Price is lower than the
Preliminary Loan Purchase Price).

Sellers\' Representations 

| 
---|--- 

10.1

|

During the preparation of the Transaction the Parties have exchanged
comprehensive information enabling the Purchaser to thoroughly evaluate the
Companies and their business activities under commercial, financial,
technical, organizational, environmental, tax and legal aspects. The Purchaser
had numerous discussions with the Companies\' management, as well as site
visits to the facilities operated by the Companies. The Purchaser confirms to
the Sellers that (i) the Purchaser or its respective employees, agents or
professional advisors, in compliance with applicable antitrust laws, have had
full access to all information and documents contained in the data room
provided for the Purchaser's information and as listed in Schedule 5, and (ii)
the Purchaser has independently carried out such other reviews or
investigations as the Purchaser may have considered necessary or appropriate,
including the aforementioned information visits as the case may be. For
documentation purposes the Parties have deposited with the recording notary a
USB stick containing scanned copies of all documents that have been made
available to the Purchaser prior to the Signing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

10.2

|

In addition to the Purchaser's independent research and investigations, if
any, the Sellers represent vis-a-vis the Purchaser by way of independent
guarantees (Sec. 311 para. (1) BGB) the information as set forth in Schedule 6
to be true and correct as of the Signing Date or as of such other date as
expressly referred to in the respective clause; provided, however, that any
representation of Seller 2 is explicitly restricted to the information as set
forth in clause 1 and 4 of Schedule 6. The scope and content of each of
Sellers\' representations contained in Schedule 6 as well as the Sellers\'
potential liability arising thereunder shall be exclusively defined by the
provisions of this Agreement (in particular the limitations on Purchaser's
rights and remedies set forth in clause 11 below), which shall be an integral
part of the Sellers\' representations and none of the Sellers\'
representations shall be construed as a Seller\'s guarantee within the meaning
of Sec. 443 and 444 BGB (Garantie fur die Beschaffenheit der Sache).

|

Remedies for Breach of Sellers\' Representations 

| 
---|--- 

11.1

|

If and to the extent a representation made pursuant to clause 10.2 proves to
be incorrect, the relevant Seller shall be given the opportunity to restore
the situation as described in the respective representation 

(Naturalrestitution). If the relevant Seller does not establish such status
within an adequate period of time and in no event later than three (3) months
after receipt of a specified notice describing in detail the respective
incorrectness, then the relevant Seller shall pay upon the Purchaser's request
to the respective company or, at the Purchaser's choice, to the Purchaser, the
amount required to compensate for damages which result from such incorrect
representation. However, any liability of the Sellers for indirect, incidental
or consequential damages (indirekte oder Folgeschaden), internal
administration and overhead costs, lost profits (entgangener Gewinn) or lost
business opportunities (entgangene Geschaftschancen) is hereby expressly
excluded unless protection against such indirect, incidental or consequential
damages, lost profits or lost business opportunities constitutes the actual
intent and purpose (Sinn und Zweck) of any of the respective warranty or
representation. Any compensation amount shall be computed net of any proven
advantages and benefits (including avoided losses, tax benefits and savings
and increases in the value of any asset owned by the Companies (Abzug neu fur
alt) resulting from the incorrect representation (Vorteilsanrechnung)).

| 
---|--- 

11.2

|

Any liability of the Sellers shall also be excluded 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

if claims of the Purchaser or the facts on which such claims are based have
been known by the Purchaser or have been fairly disclosed to the Purchaser
(including its officers, employees, representatives, agents or advisors and
including within the information listed in Schedule 5), prior to the Signing
Date; or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

if the matter to which the claim relates has been provided for in the Closing
Date Accounts but only to the extent such provision has reduced the Final
Shares Purchase Price; or 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

to the extent the amount of the claim can be recovered from an existing
insurance or would have been recoverable under any insurance policy as
existing at Closing if the insurance coverage had been continued without
change (including reasonable increases in the ordinary course, consistent with
past practice); or 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

to the extent the amount of the claim is recovered from any third party; or 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

to the extent the Purchaser or following Closing any of the Companies has
participated in causing (mitverursacht) such Purchaser's claim within the
meaning of Sec. 254 para. (1) BGB or has failed to comply with its duty to
mitigate damages pursuant to Sec. 254 para. (2) BGB; or 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

if any individual claim does not exceed EUR 100,000 (in words: one hundred
thousand Euro) and to the extent the aggregate amount of all claims does not
exceed 1.5 % of the Final Purchase Price, in which case only the amount
exceeding the total sum of 1.5 % of the Final Purchase Price can be recovered
(Freibetrag); or 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

to the extent any claims recoverable (whether individually or in the
aggregate) amount (as far as a liability of Seller 1 is concerned) to more
than 10% of the Final Shares Purchase Price and (as far as a liability of
Seller 2, other than under clause 22, is concerned) to more than 10% of the
Final Loan Purchase Price. 

| 
---|--- 

11.3

|

The limitations pursuant to clause 11.2 shall not apply to 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

claims in respect of guarantees made by each Seller in clause 1 through 4 of
Schedule 6 with regard to the Shares and Shareholder Loan; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

claims under clause 12.2 (Tax Indemnity) and/or 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

claims based on a Seller\'s fraud (Arglist) or willful misconduct (Vorsatz) 

in which events the respective Seller shall be individually liable
(Teilschuldnerschaft) for the full amount of the respective claims, but in any
case limited to the Final Shares Purchase Price or the Final Loan Purchase
Price attributable to the relevant Seller, as far as legally permissible. 

| 
---|--- 

11.4

|

The liability of the Sellers for claims raised by third parties against the
Companies or the Purchaser (as the case may be) shall be excluded to the
extent (i) the Purchaser has failed (x) to provide the Sellers with any and
all information available insofar (including copies of all related
correspondence), (y) to offer the Sellers adequate opportunity to participate,
at Sellers\' costs and expenses, in all proceedings necessary or appropriate
to dispute and/or defend against such claims or (z) to duly defend against
such claims as reasonably directed by the Sellers and (ii) such failure has
increased the liability of the Sellers. 

| 
---|--- 

11.5

|

Any and all claims under this clause 11 shall be time-barred (verjahrt) (i) 18
(eighteen) months after the Closing Date, except for claims based on clause 1,
2.1, 2.2, 2.4 and 4 of Schedule 6 which shall be time-barred five (5) years
after the Closing Date, or (ii) any prior day following the Closing Date on
which control over the Companies changes (i.e. the Companies cease to be the
Purchaser\'s Affiliates). Section 203 BGB shall not apply. 

| 
---|--- 

11.6

|

The Parties agree that the rights and remedies the Purchaser may have with
respect to the breach of a representation by the Sellers contained in this
Agreement are limited to the rights and remedies explicitly contained herein
and that, in particular, any and all damage claims based on any such breach by
the Sellers are excluded except as set forth in this clause 11 and clause 12.
Except for the claims for specific performance (primare Erfullungspflichten)
as well as any rights and claims arising under the provisions of this
agreement (including the tax provisions, covenants, the restrictive covenants
and rescission rights), any and all rights and remedies of any legal nature
which the Purchaser may otherwise have against the Sellers in connection with
the former shareholdings of Seller 1 in the Companies or the Transaction shall
be excluded. In particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Purchaser, to the extent legally permissible, hereby waives any claims
under statutory representations and warranties (Sec. 434 et seqq. BGB),
statutory contractual or pre‑contractual obligations (Sec. 280 to 282, 311
BGB) or frustration of contract (Sec. 313 BGB) or tort (Sec. 823 et seqq.
BGB); the Purchaser shall have no right to rescind, cancel or otherwise
terminate this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy which would have a
similar effect, except for the rescission or termination rights specifically
set forth in this Agreement, and the Purchaser undertakes to procure that none
of the Companies raises any claims against the Sellers or any executive,
employee or other representative of the Sellers not provided for in this
Agreement. The provisions of this clause 11.5 shall not affect any mandatory
rights and remedies of the Purchaser for fraud or wilful misconduct (Vorsatz),
e.g., Sec. 826 BGB or Sec. 823 para. (2) BGB in connection with criminal
offences.

exclusively defined by the provisions of this Agreement (in particular the
limitations on Purchaser's rights and remedies set forth in clause 11 above),
which shall be an integral part of the representations of Seller 1 and none of
the representations of Seller 1 shall be construed as a Seller\'s guarantee

(a)

|

Subject to, and limited by, the provisions set forth in this clause 12, Seller
1 shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to all Taxes of the Companies
which are allocable to time periods or portions thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date (such period the Pre Closing Date Period; Taxes allocable to
time periods starting before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing

numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in the entire period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (e.g., Taxes

(c)

|

The Purchaser shall have no Tax Indemnity Claim and no claim based on clause
12.2(b) if and to the extent 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the relevant Taxes do not exceed the aggregate amounts of all Tax liabilities
and Tax provisions accounted for in the Closing Date Accounts to the extent
such Tax liabilities and Tax provisions have reduced the Final Shares Purchase
Price in accordance with clause 9; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the relevant Tax has been paid or discharged until the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

successors to all or parts of their business(es) following the Closing Date
with economic effect as of a point in time prior to the Closing Date, provided

relevant Tax. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

If and to the extent in respect of periods after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser or any of the Companies or any successor to all or parts of their
business(es) receives any Tax benefit as the result of circumstances which
have been giving rise to a Tax Indemnity Claim or a claim based on clause
12.2(b) (including, but not limited to timing difference (Phasenverschiebung),
extension of amortization or depreciation periods or higher depreciation
allowances or non-recognition of expenses and/or provisions - the Tax
Benefit), then the Tax Benefit shall reduce the Tax Indemnity Claim or the
claim based on clause 12.2(b) to the extent that the relevant Tax Benefit has
been realized in a cash effective manner (i.e., by way of receipt of a
payment, by way of offset or by way of a reduction of a Tax that otherwise
would have become payable) prior to or on the date on which the Tax Indemnity
Claim or the claim based on clause 12.2(b) becomes due and payable or will be
realized within seven (7) fiscal years after the Closing Date. Any Tax Benefit
shall be computed as per the date when the Purchaser notifies Seller 1 of the
Tax Indemnity Claim and shall (i) be equal to the nominal amount of the Tax
Benefit to the extent the Tax Benefit has already been realized by that date,
or (ii) to the extent any Tax Benefit is reasonably expected to arise in a
cash effective manner after that date be calculated on the basis of a lump sum
calculation by reference to the tax rates applicable on the date the Purchaser
notifies Seller 1 of the Tax Indemnity Claim and for the avoidance of doubt
without any discounting to a net present value.

(e)

|

Seller 1 shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to any Tax refund claims
accounted for in the Closing Date Accounts which are not received on the basis
of a non-appealable Tax assessment notice, but only if and to the extent such
Tax refund claims have actually increased the Final Shares Purchase Price in
accordance with clause 9 and have not been applied against a Tax Indemnity
Claim of the Purchaser pursuant to clause 12.2 (a). 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

Any indemnification payment to be made by the Seller 1 pursuant to clause 12.2
shall be due ten (10) Business Days after the Seller 1 has been notified by

(3) Business Days prior to the Date at which the relevant Tax falls due. 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

The limitations pursuant to Clause 11 shall not apply to claims under this
Clause 12.2. The liability of Seller 1 for any claims of the Purchaser against
Seller 1 under this clause 12.2 shall be limited to the amount of the Final
Shares Purchase Price.

parts of their business(es) by receipt of cash payment, set-off, deduction or
otherwise relating to the Pre Closing Date Period, together with any interest
thereon paid or credited by the Tax Authorities, net of any Taxes thereon, and
only if and to the extent the aggregate of all such Tax refunds exceeds the
respective tax refund claims reflected in the Closing Date Accounts that have
increased the Final Shares Purchase Price in accordance with clause 9, and
such Tax Refund does not give rise to additional Taxes of the Companies, the
Purchaser, a party related to the Purchaser or any successor to all or parts
of their business(es) (clause 12.2(d) shall apply mutatis mutandis); 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

any unused Tax liabilities or Tax provisions accounted for in the Closing Date
Accounts which are reversed on the basis of a non-appealable Tax assessment
notice, but only if and to the extent such Tax liabilities and Tax provisions

clause 9 and have not been applied against a Tax Indemnity Claim of the
Purchaser pursuant to clause 12.2 (a); and 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

any Taxes which are imposed on the Seller 1 or a party related to the Seller 1
due to an increase of any of the Companies' taxable income which is attributed
to the Seller 1 due to a tax group for corporate income tax (including
solidarity surcharge) and trade tax purposes (korperschaftsteuerliche und
gewerbesteuerliche Organschaft) if and to the extent such increase of taxable
income results from (A) a reorganization or transaction having a Tax effect on
a Pre Closing Date Tax Period initiated by the Purchaser, the Purchaser's

After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and file (or cause the
Companies to prepare and file), when due, all returns, declarations, reports,
claims for refund, forms or notices relating to any Tax (herein Tax Returns)
required to be filed by or on behalf of the Companies with respect to any Pre
Closing Date Period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a consistent basis,
applying the same policies, procedures, election rights and practices as
applied in the preparation of the Tax Returns for previous Tax periods of the
relevant Company, to the extent these policies etc. do not breach mandatory
law and do not contradict published decrees of the Tax Authorities without a
respective disclosure to the Tax Authorities. The Purchaser shall provide, or
cause the Companies to provide to Seller 1, drafts of such Tax Returns as
timely prior to the relevant filing date as reasonably appropriate but in any
event not later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date of the
relevant Tax Return in order to enable the Seller 1 to review such Tax returns
and provide comments thereon to the Purchaser. All such Tax Returns and any
amendments to all Tax Returns filed by the Companies which relate to any Pre
Closing Date Period shall require the prior consent of the Seller 1 (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall be deemed to have been granted
if Seller 1 does not answer within twenty (20) Business Days following the
receipt by Seller 1 of any such Tax Returns or amendments), and shall, if the
Seller 1 and the Purchaser fail to reach an agreement thereon, be prepared and
filed in accordance with Seller 1's instructions unless these instructions
breach mandatory law, contradict published decrees of the Tax Authorities
without a respective disclosure to the Tax Authorities or do not comply with
past practice of the Companies. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall within five (5) Business Days
after receipt provide (and cause the Companies to provide) the Seller 1 with
copies of all Tax assessment notices (Steuerbescheide), other decisions,
notices of any Tax audit, proceeding or investigation and any other material
written communication with the Tax Authorities received by any of the
Companies, the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser's affiliates from any Tax
Authority or court and relating to Taxes of the Pre Closing Date Period and
relevant for this clause 12 (the Relevant Tax Matter). Upon request of the
Seller 1, the Purchaser shall provide reasonable information necessary to
determine the relevant facts and amounts. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

The Purchaser shall procure that with respect to Relevant Tax Matters (i) the
Seller 1 and the Seller 1's advisors are granted the right to participate in

expense of Seller 1, reasonable objections are filed and legal proceedings are
instituted and conducted against any Tax assessments or other decisions of the
Tax Authorities with respect to Relevant Tax Matters in accordance with Seller
1's directions. Alternatively, if and to the extent a Relevant Tax Matter
relates to the German tax group for corporate income tax (including solidarity
surcharge) and trade tax purposes (korperschaftsteuerliche und
gewerbesteuerliche Organschaft) among the Seller 1 and the Company or the
Company and HCC, the Seller may elect at any time to direct, through counsel
of their own choice and at their own expense, any reasonable actions including
legal remedies to be taken with respect to any audit, claim for refund and
administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with
respect to any Relevant Tax Matter (collectively Tax Litigation). If the
Seller elects to direct a Tax Litigation in accordance with the preceding
sentence, then (i) the Purchaser shall cooperate and follow Seller's
instructions and shall cause the Companies or their respective successors to
cooperate and follow Seller's instructions in each phase of such Tax
Litigation and (ii) the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably practical
empower, and shall cause the Companies or their respective successors promptly
to empower, the designated representative of such Seller to represent the
relevant Company or its successor in the Tax Litigation. 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

The Purchaser shall not (and shall ensure that the Companies will not) settle
any Relevant Tax Matter or concede or give their consent to the findings of
any Tax audit relating to a Relevant Tax Matter without the prior written
consent of the Seller 1 (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall
be deemed to have been granted if Seller 1 does not answer within fifteen (15)
Business Days). 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

After the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Seller 1 shall fully cooperate,
and shall cause the Companies and their representatives to fully cooperate, in
all other respects in connection with all Relevant Tax Matters, including the

investigation, dispute or appeal or any other communication with any Tax
Authority. Such cooperation shall include (but shall not be limited to) the
review of all books, records and information, and the assistance of all
officers and employees of the Companies, to the extent necessary in connection
with Relevant Tax Matters. In addition, clause 17 shall apply accordingly.

12.5

Limitation Periods 

Any and all claims under this clause 12 except any claims under clause 12.4

laws of foreign jurisdictions.

Purchaser's Representations; Remedies 

| 
---|--- 

13.1

|

The Purchaser represents vis-a-vis the Sellers by way of independent
guarantees (Sec. 311 para. (1) BGB) that at the Signing Date and, except for
clause 13.1 (d), the Closing Date: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the Purchaser is a limited liability company, duly incorporated and validly
existing under the laws of Germany and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own its assets and to carry out its business; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the execution and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transaction are within the Purchaser's corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate actions on part of
the Purchaser; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the execution and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transaction neither violate the Purchaser's articles of
association or bylaws nor any applicable law, regulation, judgment, injunction
or order binding on the Purchaser, and there is no action, law suit,
investigation or proceeding (except for merger control clearances, if any)
pending against, or to the Purchaser's knowledge, threatened in writing
against the Purchaser before any court, arbitration panel or governmental
authority which in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, alter or delay
the Transaction; and 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

as of the Signing Date only, the Purchaser does not have actual knowledge of
any facts or circumstances that could give rise to claims against the Sellers
pursuant to clauses 10, 11 or 12.2 (b) in connection with clause 12.1. 

| 
---|--- 

13.2

|

In the event that any of the representations pursuant to clause 13.1 should be
incorrect, the Purchaser shall fully indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless
from any of the Sellers\' respective damages. All claims for any breach of
guarantees pursuant to this clause 13.2 shall become time-barred (verjahren)
18 (eighteen) months after the Closing Date. 

 

| 
---|--- 

14

|

Anti Trust Filings 

| 
---|--- 

14.1

|

The Purchaser has, inter alia based on information provided by the Sellers,
(i) done a thorough analysis of the merger control filing requirements in the
jurisdictions in which such filings may potentially be required, (ii) prepared
respective draft filings and (iii) made such analysis as well as such draft
filings available to the Sellers for review and comments. Based on this
analysis, the Parties assume that the Transaction will be authorized without
any conditions or other requirements (Bedingungen oder Auflagen) within the
initial waiting period of 50 calendar days. 

| 
---|--- 

14.2

|

As soon as reasonably practical after the Signing Date, the Transaction shall
be notified to the competent merger authorities specified in clause 6.1 (a).
The notification shall be filed by the Purchaser on behalf of the Sellers and
the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall further ensure that all other filings with,
or notifications to, any 

governmental authority required in connection with this Agreement will be made
without undue delay at the pertinent time as required by law, provided that
the Sellers reasonably comply, and procure that the Companies reasonably
comply, with the obligations in the following sentence. The Sellers shall upon
request submit to the Purchaser all documents and other information, and shall
provide such other assistance to the filings, in each case as necessary and
reasonably practical to obtain clearance of the Transaction as soon as
possible.

| 
---|--- 

14.3

|

In order to obtain all governmental authorizations for the consummation of the
Transaction under the applicable merger control laws, the Purchaser and the
Sellers shall (i) reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
any filings or notifications and in connection with any submissions,
investigations or enquiries, (ii) supply to any governmental authority as soon
as reasonably practical any additional information requested by such
governmental authority or required pursuant to any applicable laws and take
all other actions reasonably required to obtain the necessary authorizations
for the consummation of the Transaction or to cause any applicable waiting
periods to commence and to expire, (iii) promptly provide the other Party with
copies of any written (or written summaries of any non-written) communication
received or sent in connection with any proceeding referred to in this clause
14.3 and (iv) give the other Party and its respective advisors the opportunity
to participate in all meetings, communications and conferences with any
relevant governmental authority, to the extent legally permissible. The
Purchaser is only entitled to withdraw any filings or to agree with any
competent authority on an extension of the examination period for a filing if
and to the extent the Sellers have granted their prior written consent not
unreasonably to be withheld. 

| 
---|--- 

14.4

|

If and to the extent any governmental authority referred to in clause 6.1 (a)
indicates that it intends not to authorize the Transaction, the Purchaser
shall offer to such governmental authority any commitments (Zusagen) necessary
in order to obtain clearance of the Transaction subject to conditions
(Auflagen und Bedingungen). These shall include any and all measures which
render the clearance of the Transaction by the respective governmental
authority possible, in particular the divestiture of any businesses or parts
thereof, to the extent this reduces the market shares attributable to the
Purchaser and the markets in which the competent governmental authority
expects the Transaction to lead to the creation or increase of a dominant
market position (marktbeherrschende Stellung) to such extent that the
respective governmental authority does no longer expect the creation or the
increase of such dominant market position. If and to the extent the clearance
of the Transaction is subject to the compliance with any such conditions, the
Purchaser shall, however, be obliged to fulfil such conditions. The Purchaser
may not request any adjustment or repayment of the Purchase Price or any other
amendment of this Agreement as a result of (i) any divestiture or other action
pursuant this clause 14.4, (ii) any legal consequences caused by the non-
compliance with any filing requirements or (iii) any decision by a competent
governmental authority, whether or not specified in clause 6.1 (a), taken
after the Closing prohibiting the Transaction or any part thereof. 

| 
---|--- 

14.5

|

If the Conditions Precedent have been fulfilled but the Transaction has, due
to still pending merger control proceedings in jurisdictions other than those
referred to in clause 6.1 (a), not been cleared under the laws of such other
jurisdiction, Closing shall be performed to the maximum extent legally
permitted. The Purchaser shall agree to take, and/or consent to, all
appropriate measures including the conclusion of a "hold separate agreement"
for one or more Companies in order to have such Companies be exempted, for the
time being, from the consummation of the Transaction until the pending
clearances have been granted. The foregoing shall neither delay the Closing
nor affect the obligation of the Purchaser to timely pay the full Preliminary
Purchase Price. 

The Purchaser agrees and shall ensure that neither the Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates will, prior to the Closing Date, take any action that could
prevent, delay or otherwise infer with any merger clearances of the
Transaction.
