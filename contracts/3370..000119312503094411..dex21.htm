claim or right or any benefit arising under or resulting from such Purchased
Asset that is included in the Purchased Assets but is not assignable or
transferable without the consent of any Person (other than the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, or the Seller or any of its Affiliates) or for which
assignment without such consent would constitute a breach thereunder, to the
extent that such consent shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to _Section 2.07(a)(ii)_ , the Seller
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts obtain all necessary consents
to the assignment thereof and, upon obtaining the requisite third party
consents thereto, such Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising under or resulting from such Purchased Asset shall be transferred
and assigned to the Purchaser or the applicable Acquiring Entity hereunder in
accordance with _Section 2.04(a)(i)_ , at no additional consideration from the
Purchaser or such Acquiring Entity.



(ii) At any time following a reasonable determination by the Purchaser
that the Seller has failed to obtain any consent pursuant to _Section
2.07(a)(i)_ with respect to a Specified Purchased Asset, the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates shall have the right, exercisable by delivering to the
Seller a Repurchase Notice with respect to such Specified Purchased Asset, to
require the Seller to purchase, on the Specified Settlement Date, any such
Specified Purchased Asset for a price equal to the Repurchase Price set forth
in the Repurchase Notice.



(iii) The closing of each repurchase of a Specified Purchased Asset pursuant
to _Section 2.07(a)(ii)_ shall take place on the related Specified Settlement
Date. Upon each repurchase of a Specified Purchased Asset pursuant to _Section
2.07(a)(ii)_ , (A) the Seller shall pay, or shall cause any of its Affiliates
to pay, to the Purchaser or its Affiliates, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Purchaser, the
aggregate Repurchase Price with respect to such Specified Purchased Asset to
be sold at such closing, and (B) the Purchaser shall assign, or shall cause
any of its Affiliates to assign, to the Seller or any of its Affiliates on an
" _AS-IS, WHERE IS_ " basis, without representation, warranty or recourse of
any kind (other than, with respect to any Specified Purchased Asset that is a
Purchased Financing Contract, the Agreed Warranties (as defined in the Program
Agreement Term Sheet)), all of the  



 

4  Purchasers or its Affiliates right, title and interest in (1) the
Specified Purchased Asset described in the related Repurchase Notice and
for which the Seller or its Affiliates had paid the Repurchase Price as
provided in the foregoing clause (A), and (2) in the event the Specified
Purchased Asset repurchased in accordance with _Section 2.07(a)(ii)_ is a
Purchased Financing Contract, the Portfolio Property, if any, that is subject
to or governed by such Purchased Financing Contract to the extent that such
Portfolio Property shall not theretofore have been (x) transferred or sold to
an Obligor under such Purchased Financing Contract (or its Affiliate or
assignee), (y) foreclosed upon or repossessed and remarketed, or (z) sold or
re-leased following termination of such Purchased Financing Contract.



(iv) Each Repurchase Notice shall specify the Specified Purchased Asset as to
which the Purchaser or its Affiliate is exercising a Repurchase Option, a
description of the failure to receive the consent pursuant to which such
Repurchase Option is being exercised and the Repurchase Price in respect of
such Specified Purchased Asset (together with (x) a summary showing in
reasonable detail the manner in which such Repurchase Price was calculated and
(y) a duly executed certificate of the Purchaser certifying the calculation of
such Repurchase Price). Delivery of a Repurchase Notice by the Purchaser or
its Affiliate shall be irrevocable and, upon delivery thereof to the Seller,
the Seller shall be bound to pay to the Seller, on the related Specified
Settlement Date, the Repurchase Price with respect to the Specified Purchased
Asset identified in such Repurchase Notice, subject only to the condition
that the Purchaser or its Affiliate assign such Specified Purchased Asset at
the closing of such repurchase on the terms described above in _Section
2.07(a)(iii)_.



(b) With respect to any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising under or resulting from such Purchased Asset included in the
Purchased Assets that is not assigned to the Purchaser or an Acquiring Entity
at the Closing by reason of _Section 2.07(a)_ , after the Closing and until
the applicable requisite consents are obtained and the foregoing sold and
assigned to the Purchaser or the applicable Acquiring Entity, the Seller shall
provide in any lawful and reasonable manner to the Purchaser or the applicable
Acquiring Entity, in accordance with this _Section 2.07(b)_ , the benefits
under each such Purchased Asset or right or any benefit arising under or
resulting from such Purchased Asset (with the Purchaser responsible for all
Assumed Liabilities thereunder to the extent it would be liable under the
applicable Purchased Asset if the requisite consent had been obtained and such
Purchased Asset or right had been assigned to the Purchaser). In particular,
in the event that any requisite consent is not obtained prior to
Closing, then the Purchaser or the applicable Acquiring Entity and Seller
shall enter into such lawful and reasonable arrangements (including
sublicensing, subleasing or subcontracting, if permitted) to provide to the
Purchaser or such Acquiring Entity the economic and operational equivalent of
obtaining such requisite consent and assigning such Purchased Asset or right,
including enforcement for the benefit of the Purchaser or such Acquiring
Entity of all claims or rights arising thereunder, and the performance by the
Purchaser or such Acquiring Entity of the obligations thereunder. The Seller
shall take all actions reasonably requested by the Purchaser or the applicable
Acquiring Entity to enforce the rights of the Purchaser or such
Acquiring Entity under any such Purchased  



 

5  Assets, including the assertion and enforcement of any right, claim,
presentation, demand or draw under or with respect to any such Purchased
Assets. Upon the Closing, the Seller authorizes the Purchaser and the
Acquiring Entities, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at the
Purchasers expense to (x) perform all of the Assumed Liabilities under each
of the contracts and agreements that comprise the Purchased Assets but that
are not assigned to the Purchaser or an Acquiring Entity after giving effect
to _Section 2.07(a)_ and (y) amend, modify or waive any such contract or
agreement in the Sellers name and in such manner as the Purchaser or the
applicable Acquiring Entity may reasonably desire. On the Closing Date, or as
requested from time to time after the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide
to the Purchaser and the Acquiring Entities such powers of attorney as the
Purchaser may reasonably request in order to enable the Purchaser and the
Acquiring Entities to effectuate the foregoing provisions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any and all liabilities or obligations incurred by the Seller
arising out of, resulting from, based upon, in connection with or relating to
any action taken by the Purchaser or the applicable Acquiring Entity pursuant
to any such power of attorney shall be Assumed Liabilities.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each of the
Seller Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
past practices to preserve substantially intact the Business and the
Purchased Assets and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its
present business relationships consistent with past practices, including
relationships with (x) each Transferred Employee, (y) each Person that has a
business relationship which is advantageous to the Business and (z) Obligors
under Purchased Financing Contracts, in each case, where the discontinuance of
such relationships would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Purchased Assets or the billing, collection, administration or
servicing thereof. Nothing in this _Section 5.01(c)_ shall prevent the
applicable Seller Entity from applying the Risk Management Policy For Leasing
in a manner consistent with _Section 5.01(d)_.



(d) Except as otherwise expressly required by this Agreement, the Seller
Entities shall conduct the Business in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with their past practices, maintain their respective books,
accounts and records with respect to the Purchased Assets in the usual,
regular and ordinary manner, cause such books, accounts and records to be true
and complete in all material respects and comply with the provisions set forth
in the remainder of this _Section 5.01(d)_. Except as otherwise expressly
required by this Agreement, with respect to the Business, the Seller Entities
shall not: (i) waive or commit to waive any right that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) modify, replace or supercede
the Risk Management Policy For Leasing; (iii) modify, replace or supercede any
credit, underwriting or collection practices of IOS Capital with respect to,
or in any way modify the payment schedule, payment terms or any other term or
condition of, any Purchased Financing Contract, or make any advance,
extension, novation or other accommodation to any lessee or Obligor under any
Purchased Financing Contract, except, in each case, for modifications,
replacements, supersessions, advances, extensions, novations or other  



 

7  accommodations made or entered into in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with the past practices and with the Risk Management Policy For
Leasing, and reflected, to the extent applicable, in the books and records of
IOS Capital; (iv) except for Permitted Encumbrances, mortgage, pledge, or
otherwise encumber any Purchased Assets; (v) sell, lease, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets, other than any of the
following entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with the
past practices of IOS Capital: (A) leases or conditional sales of equipment
that is subject to Financing Contracts, (B) sales, leases, transfers or other
disposals of Portfolio Property following (or concurrently with) the
expiration or termination of the relevant Purchased Financing Contract and (C)
sales, leases, transfers or other disposals of obsolete tangible
personal Property that is no longer used in the Business; (vi) reclassify or
transfer employees from or to IOS Capital in excess of 20 employees or hire
new employees into IOS Capital other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices; (vii) take any action that would breach any
of the IKON Parties representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement if such representation, warranty or covenant were made at the
time of the action; or (viii) enter into any agreement, contract or
commitment (other than this Agreement) to do any of the things prohibited by
the foregoing clauses (i) through (viii); _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit (A) IOS Capital from
selling or otherwise transferring to the Seller Financing Contracts and
related equipment if such Financing Contract has reached maturity, the
customer has remained in possession of the equipment, the customer pays on a
month-to-month basis and the residual has been reduced on the books and
records of IOS Capital to $0, (B) any Seller Entity from granting Encumbrances
to secure borrowings that will be repaid at or prior to Closing or (C) any
Seller Entity from complying with each Non-Purchased Securitization Document
or continuing each Securitization Transaction in effect on the date hereof in
compliance with such Securitization Documents in effect on the date hereof,
subject to the satisfaction of the condition set forth in  _Section 6.01(l)_
, in each case, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices.



(e) The Purchaser shall not (i) take any action that would breach any of the
Purchasers representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement if such representation, warranty or covenant were made at the
time of the action; or (ii) enter into any agreement, contract or commitment
(other than this Agreement) to do any of the things prohibited by the
foregoing clause (i). 



Section 5.02. _Pending or Threatened Litigation_. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, the Seller Entities and the Purchaser shall inform
each other, promptly upon obtaining Knowledge thereof, of any pending or
threatened Action which reasonably could be anticipated to (a)
render inaccurate in any material respect any representation or warranty made
by the Seller Entities or the Purchaser (as the case may be); or (b) prohibit
or restrain or materially and adversely affect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the performance by any Seller Entity or
the Purchaser of its respective obligations hereunder.



 

8 Section 5.03. _Tax Matters_.



(a) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. As soon as practicable following the
signing of this Agreement, but in no event later than 120 days following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide to the Seller copies of IRS Form
8594 and any required exhibits thereto with the Purchasers proposed
allocation of the Purchase Price, including the Assumed Liabilities, among
the Purchased Assets and the ABS Assets. Within 60 days after the receipt of
such Form 8594, the Seller shall propose to the Purchaser any changes to such
Form 8594 or shall indicate its concurrence therewith. The failure by
the Seller to propose any such change or to indicate its concurrence within
such 60 days shall be deemed to be an indication of its concurrence with such
Form 8594. The Purchaser and the Seller shall file, and shall cause their
Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and statements, forms and schedules in
connection therewith in a manner consistent with such allocation of the
Purchase Price and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required to
do so by applicable Tax Laws. Any disputes with respect to the items on Form
8594 which the Purchaser and the Seller, acting in good faith, are unable to
resolve shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 5.05(b)_. Each of the parties
to this Agreement shall be bound by the decision rendered in accordance with
_Section 5.05(b)_.



(b) _Property Taxes_. The Seller shall bear all property and ad valorem Tax
liability with respect to the Purchased Assets and the ABS Assets if the lien
or assessment date arises on or prior to the Closing Date irrespective of the
reporting and payment dates of such Taxes. For Tax Returns with respect to
such property and ad valorem Taxes which are due on or prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller will file such Tax Returns. For Tax Returns with respect to
such property and ad valorem Taxes which are due after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser will file such Tax Returns. It will be the responsibility of the
Seller to ensure that the Purchaser receives the Tax bills that the Seller
receives from the taxing authority in a timely fashion with respect
to property and ad valorem Taxes, which are to be paid by the Seller. Except
with respect to cost per copy leases or other leases that include property or
ad valorem Taxes in the monthly payment and do not separately invoice such
Taxes, the Purchaser will invoice the lessee and remit the funds received
with respect to property and ad valorem Taxes which are to be paid by the
Seller promptly upon receipt to the Seller. The Purchaser shall bear all
property and ad valorem Tax liability with respect to the Purchased Assets or
the ABS Assets if the lien or assessment date arises after the Closing Date.



(c) _Cooperation with Respect to Tax Returns_. The Purchaser and the Seller
agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, and each at its own
expense, in a timely manner, such information (including access to books and
records) and assistance, including making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanations of any
material provided relating to the Purchased Assets as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for any audit, and for
the prosecution or defense of any claim or Action relating to any adjustment
or proposed adjustment with respect to Taxes or any appraisal of the
Purchased Assets. The Seller shall retain in its possession all Tax Returns
and Tax records relating to the Purchased Assets that might be relevant to any
Taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date until the relevant
statute of limitations has expired.  



 

9  After such time, the Seller may dispose of such materials; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to such disposition the Seller shall give
the Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to take possession of such materials,
at the Purchasers expense.



(d) _Erroneous Tax Payments_. If the Purchaser determines that any Taxes in
respect of any Purchased Financing Contract are due and the
Seller erroneously paid such Taxes at the inception of such Purchased
Financing Contract and the Purchaser is unable to collect such Taxes from the
Obligor under such Purchased Financing Contract, at the Purchasers request
the Seller shall initiate a timely and proper refund claim for the relevant
Taxes. The Seller shall promptly pay any such refund and the interest actually
received thereon to the Purchaser upon receipt thereof by the Seller, net of
any reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by the Seller in connection
with such refund claim. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall be deemed
to actually receive a refund to the extent that the making of a claim for a
refund results in a reduction of any Tax liability of the Seller.



Section 5.04. _Indemnifications, Assumptions of Liability and Related
Matters_.



(a) _Indemnification by the Seller for Breach_. Following the Closing, the
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Purchaser, its
Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against and
in respect of any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by any IKON Party in this Agreement that, as
of the Closing, has not been cured by the applicable IKON Party or waived by
the Purchaser in accordance with _Section 8.01_ ; (ii) any failure to perform
any covenant, agreement or undertaking on the part of any IKON
Party contained in this Agreement; or (iii) any breach of a representation or
warranty in or omission of information included in any certificate delivered
by or on behalf of any IKON Party pursuant to _Section 5.19_ or _Section
6.01(a)(iii)(A)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.04(a)_ , a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (other than in _Section
3.07(a)_ ) shall be deemed to exist either if such representation or warranty
is actually inaccurate or breached or if such representation or warranty
would have been breached or been inaccurate if such representation or warranty
had not contained any limitation or qualification as to materiality, Material
Adverse Effect, knowledge or Knowledge in any such representation or warranty
or any limitation expressed as a monetary amount contained in _Section 3.13_
or _Section 3.20_ , it being the intention of the parties hereto that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified and held harmless from and
against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them resulting
from, arising out of, based upon or relating to the failure of any such
representation or warranty to be true, correct and complete in any
respect, determined in each case without regard to any qualification as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, knowledge or Knowledge in any such
representation or warranty or any limitation expressed as a monetary amount
contained in _Section 3.13_  or _Section 3.20_ with respect thereto.



 

10 (b) _Limitation on Liability_.



(i) Each Purchaser Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification for any
Damages suffered or incurred by such Person resulting from, arising out of,
based on or relating to (A) a breach of any representation or warranty in
_Sections 3.01_ , _3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.16_ , _3.18(b)(iii)(B)_ , _3.19(a)_ ,
_3.20_ , _3.21(h)_ and  _3.22_ (individually a " _Seller Special
Representation_ " and collectively, the " _Seller Special Representations_ "),
or (B) a failure to perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking of any IKON
Party, shall be entitled to such indemnification for the full amount of such
Damages regardless of the amount of the Damages.



(ii) Each Purchaser Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification under
_Section 5.04(a)(i)_ or _Section 5.04(a)(iii)_ for any Damages suffered or
incurred by such Person resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating
to a breach of any representation or warranty made by a IKON Party in this
Agreement other than a Seller Special Representation or a breach of a
representation or warranty in or omission of information included in any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of any IKON Party pursuant to _Section
5.19_ or _Section 6.01(a)(iii)(A)_ , shall be entitled to indemnification from
the Seller for the full amount of all such Damages in excess of $20,000,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Sellers indemnification
obligations in respect of Damages resulting from, arising out of, based on or
relating to any such breach of representation or warranty exceed
$2,000,000,000.



(iii) With respect to any breach of the agreements and covenants contained in
_Section 5.01(a)_ and _Section 5.02_ , to the extent that the Damages claimed
by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of any such breach result from,
arise out of or are based on or relate to facts, events and circumstances
that would give rise to a claim for indemnification under _Section 5.04(a)(i)_
for a breach of representation or warranty that is not a Special
Representation, such claim for breach of _Section 5.01(a)_ and _5.02_ shall
be subject to the limitation on liability set forth in _Section 5.04(b)(ii)_
to the same extent, if any, as a claim for breach of such representation or
warranty. Subject only to the foregoing sentence, in the event that a claim
or demand for indemnification may be made under more than one provision of
this _Section 5.04_ , the Person making such claim or demand shall have the
right to elect the provision of this _Section 5.04_  pursuant to which such
claim or demand for indemnification is made.



(iv) In calculating the amount of Taxes that are indemnifiable for Damages
resulting from a breach of a representation for the purposes of _Section
5.04(a)(i)_ , _Section 5.04(b)(i)_ or _Section 5.04(b)(ii)_ , the amount
of such Damages shall be an amount equal to the excess of (i) the Tax
liability actually incurred by the Purchaser and its Affiliates over (ii) the
Tax liability that the Purchaser and its Affiliates would have incurred if
such representation was true and correct (the " _Tax Differential_ "). The
Tax director of the Purchasers Vendor Financial Services business unit (the "
_Tax Director_ ") shall make a good faith effort to establish the Tax
Differential and shall certify such amount and the rationale for  



 

11  such calculation to the Seller (the " _Tax Certification_ "). The Seller
shall pay such Tax Differential to the Purchaser within 30 days of receipt of
the Tax Certification. In the event that any item giving rise to the Tax
Differential will reverse itself in future years or otherwise result in any
Tax savings to the Purchaser and its Affiliates in future years, the Tax
Certification shall provide the Tax Directors best estimate of when the Tax
Differential will reverse itself. In addition, the Tax Director shall make a
good faith effort to calculate the actual amount of such Tax benefit and shall
certify such amount and the rationale for such calculation to the Seller
within 30 days of the filing of any of its Tax Returns which reflect the
realization of any such Tax benefit, and shall pay such amount to the Seller
at the time of such certification.



(v) Upon a breach of a representation or warranty contained in
Section 3.21(e) that under the terms of the relevant Securitization Documents
will require a repurchase of a Purchased Financing Contract from an ABS
Entity, the Seller shall (on the required date for remittance of the
repurchase price) repurchase from the applicable ABS Entity or the Purchaser,
as applicable, each Purchased Financing Contract and related Portfolio
Property to which such breach relates at the price specified in the applicable
Securitization Document for such repurchase. Upon the consummation by the
Seller of such repurchase, each repurchased Purchased Financing Contract and
related Portfolio Property shall be deemed to be an Excluded Asset for
purposes hereof.



(vi) The Purchaser acknowledges that the Program Documentation shall provide
that the remedies available thereunder in respect of an _I_ KON Servicing
Breach (as such term is defined in the Program Agreement Term Sheet) would
apply to the exclusion of any indemnification remedy under this Agreement for
Damages arising out of the failure of an Obligor to make one or more payments
under a Purchased Financing Contract as a consequence of an actual (or
asserted) IKON Servicing Breach.



(c) _Survival of Representations and Warranties of the Seller Entities_.



(i) The Seller Special Representations and indemnifications with respect to
their breach shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ _that_ the representations and
warranties in _Section 3.20_ shall survive until the expiration of 5 years
after the Closing.



(ii) The representations and warranties of the IKON Parties in this Agreement
which are not Seller Special Representations shall survive the Closing until
the expiration of 18 months after the Closing; _provided_ _that_ the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.21_ (other than
_Section 3.21(g)_ and _Section 3.21(h)_ ) shall survive until the maturity or
redemption of any indebtedness of the ABS Entities.



 

12 (iii) The representations and warranties of the IKON Parties which are
contained in _Section 3.09_  and _Section 3.21(g)_ shall survive until 60
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.



(d) _ERISA Indemnification_. Following the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless all Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them resulting from, arising out
of, based on or relating to:



(i) any Seller Benefit Plan and any Seller Title IV Plan including any
Multiemployer Plan, maintained or contributed to, at any time, by the Seller,
IOS Capital or any ERISA Affiliate, or to which any of the foregoing Persons
is obligated to contribute at any time;



(ii) the employment or termination of employment, including a constructive
termination or failure to employ, by the Seller or IOS Capital, of
any individual (including any employee of the Seller or IOS Capital)
attributable to any actions or inactions prior to the Closing;



(iii) any claims by any employee of the Business or any Governmental Entity
against the Purchaser for any statutory violation in respect of its
hiring practices based upon any exclusion by the Seller of any employee of
the Business from _Schedule 1.01(j)_ ;



(iv) any claims by any employee of any of the Seller or IOS Capital for
workers compensation and/or related medical benefits made or asserted
after the Closing, but which result from, arise out of, are based on or
relate to an injury or illness that occurred prior to the Closing; or



(v) WARN or any other statutory or common law or civil law notice, severance
pay, termination pay in lieu thereof or Damages arising as a result of
the termination or dismissal (including constructive termination or
dismissal), by the Seller or IOS Capital of any or all employees of the
Business on or prior to the Closing, provided that the Seller shall be deemed
not to be in breach of this covenant to the extent that any such requirements
result solely from the aggregation of the termination or dismissal (including
constructive termination or dismissal) of Transferred Employees by the
Purchaser following the Closing with the termination or dismissal (including
constructive termination or dismissal) of employees of the Business by the
Seller or IOS Capital on or prior to the Closing.



 

(e) _Additional Indemnification by the Seller_. Following the Closing, the
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless all Purchaser Indemnified Parties
from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to:



(i) any of the Excluded Assets or the ownership, operation, servicing, lease
or use thereof, or any action taken with respect thereto, by any IKON
Party or any other Person;



 

13 (ii) any of the Excluded Liabilities or the Specified Liabilities;



(iii) the failure of Purchaser to receive any amounts due from an
Obligor pursuant to a Purchased Financing Contract due to the misconduct or
misrepresentation by any IKON Party in the sourcing, negotiation,
documentation, credit analysis, underwriting of a Purchased Financing Contract
or otherwise in connection with the origination of such Purchased Financing
Contract, including misrepresentations by any employee, representative or
agent of such IKON Party to an Obligor, customer or an IKON Party;



(iv) the failure of the Seller to comply with the provisions of any applicable
"bulk sales" or "bulk transfer" or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may
be applicable to the sale or transfer of any or all of the Purchased Assets to
the Purchaser;



(v) the provision, administration or servicing of collateral protection
insurance to an Obligor in respect of the related equipment under a
Financing Contract;



(vi) any Environmental Loss;



(vii) any claim by a Person (other than the Purchaser, the Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates) relating to the failure of the Seller or its
Affiliates to obtain any consent, approval or Authorization necessary to sell,
assign, transfer and convey any Purchased Asset or any claim, right or benefit
arising under or resulting from such Purchased Asset; _provided, however,_
that the Damages suffered or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
respect of any such claim shall be calculated as net of any Repurchase Price
paid by the Seller in respect of such Purchased Asset; or



(viii) any claim or Action by any Person in respect of any Seller Entitys
use or licensing on or prior to the Closing of any software or intellectual
property from Progress Software Corporation.



(f) _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against and in respect of any and
all Damages suffered or incurred by any of them resulting from, arising out
of, based on or relating to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Purchaser in this Agreement that, as of the Closing, has not been
cured by the Purchaser or waived by the Seller in accordance with  _Section
8.01_ ; (ii) any failure to perform any covenant, agreement or undertaking on
the part of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement; (iii) any breach of a
representation or warranty in or omission of information included in
any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 6.02(a)(iii)(A)_ ; (iv) the Assumed Liabilities; (v) subject in all
respects to the terms and conditions set forth in the Program Documentation
(including the obligations (including any standard of care) of the  



 

14  Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, and the remedies for breach by a party thereto
of its obligations thereunder), Third Party Actions arising out of the
conduct by the Purchaser of the Business after the Closing; or (vi) WARN or
any other statutory or common law or civil law notice, severance pay,
termination pay in lieu thereof or Damages arising as a result of the
termination or dismissal (including constructive termination or dismissal), by
the Purchaser of any or all Transferred Employees following the Closing. For
purposes of this _Section 5.04(f)_ , a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by the Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to exist either if
such representation or warranty is actually inaccurate or breached or if such
representation or warranty would have been breached or been inaccurate if such
representation or warranty had not contained any limitation or qualification
as to materiality, material adverse effect or knowledge, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered or
incurred by any of them or resulting from, arising out of, based on or
relating to the failure of any such representation or warranty, to be true,
correct and complete in any respect, determined in each case without regard to
any qualification as to materiality, material adverse effect or knowledge set
forth with respect thereto.



(g) _Survival of Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser; Limitation
on Liability_.



(i) Each Seller Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification under _Section
5.04(f)(i)_ and _Section 5.04(f)(iii)_ for any Damages suffered or incurred by
such Person resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to a breach
of any representation or warranty in _Sections 4.01_ , _4.02_ , _4.03_ ,
_4.05_ and _4.06_ (individually a " _Purchaser Special Representation_ " and
collectively the " _Purchaser Special Representations_ ") shall be entitled
to indemnification from the Purchaser for the full amount of all such Damages
regardless of the amount of the Damages.



(ii) Each Seller Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification under _Section
5.04(f)(i)_ and _Section 5.04(f)(iii)_ for any Damages suffered or incurred
by such Person resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to a
breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser or Acquiring
Entity in this Agreement other than a Purchaser Special Representation shall
be entitled to indemnification from the Purchaser for the full amount of all
such Damages in excess of $20,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Purchasers indemnification obligations in respect of Damages
resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to any such breach of
representation or warranty exceed $2,000,000,000.



(iii) The Purchaser Special Representations and indemnifications with respect
to their breach shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations.



 

15 (iv) The representations and warranties of the Purchaser in this Agreement
which are not Purchaser Special Representations shall survive the Closing
until the expiration of 18 months after the Closing.



(v) The Seller acknowledges that the Program Documentation shall provide that
the remedies available thereunder in respect of an _I_ KON Servicing Breach
(as such term is defined in the Program Agreement Term Sheet) would apply to
the exclusion of any indemnification remedy under this Agreement for Damages
arising out of the failure of an Obligor to make one or more payments under a
Purchased Financing Contract as a consequence of an actual (or asserted) IKON
Servicing Breach.



(h) _Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Actions_. For the purposes of
administering the indemnification provisions of this _Section 5.04_ , the
following procedures shall apply to Third Party Actions following the Closing
Date:



(i) An Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing within 30 days
following the receipt of notice of any Third Party Action against such
Indemnitee that gives rise to a claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Section
5.04_ (any 30-day notification requirement shall begin to run, in the case of
a Third Party Action which is amended so as to give rise to an Indemnification
Event, from the first day such Third Party Action is amended to include any
claim for indemnity pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ ), such notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the basis of such Third Party Action. The
failure to give notice as required by this _Section 5.04(h)(i)_ in a timely
fashion shall not result in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder
unless the Indemnitors ability to defend against such Third Party Action is
materially and adversely affected by the failure of the Indemnitee to give
notice in a timely fashion as required by this _Section 5.04(h)(i)_.



(ii) The Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not obligated) to assume
the defense or settlement of any such Third Party Action, or to participate
in any negotiations or proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate any such
Third Party Action, if it shall provide the Indemnitee a written
acknowledgement of its liability for the indemnity against Damages relating
to such Third Party Action. If the Indemnitor assumes any such defense or
settlement or any such negotiations, it shall pursue such defense, settlement
or negotiations in good faith. If the Indemnitor fails to elect in writing
within 15 Business Days of the notification referred to above to assume the
defense, the Indemnitee may engage counsel to defend, settle or otherwise
dispose of such Third Party Action which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise any such Third Party Action without
the prior written consent or agreement of the Indemnitor (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



(iii) In cases where the Indemnitor has assumed the defense or settlement
with respect to a Third Party Action, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to  



 

16  assume the defense or settlement thereof with counsel of its own choosing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that: (A) the Indemnitee (and its counsel) shall be
entitled to continue to participate at its own cost (except as provided below)
in such Third Party Action and to participate in any negotiations or
proceedings to settle or otherwise eliminate, any such Third Party Action; (B)
the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to settle or compromise any such Third
Party Action without the consent or agreement of the Indemnitee (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that
if and only if such consent is withheld and the settlement or compromise
involves only the payment of monetary damages and provides an unconditional
release of the Indemnitee, the Indemnitors liability shall be limited to the
amount for which the Indemnitor agreed with the claimant to settle and the
Indemnitor shall remain responsible for its costs and attorneys fees to the
date such settlement was rejected by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee shall
be responsible for the attorneys fees and disbursements in respect of such
claim thereafter; and (C) after written notice by the Indemnitor to the
Indemnitee (as provided above) of its election to assume control of the
defense or settlement of any claim, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to
such Indemnitee hereunder for any attorneys fees and disbursements
subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection therewith (except as
provided below).



(iv) In the event indemnification is requested, the relevant Indemnitor, its
representatives and agents shall have access to the premises, books and
records of the Indemnitee or parties seeking such indemnification and their
Affiliates to the extent reasonably necessary to assist it in defending or
settling any such Third Party Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
access shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the operation of the business of the Indemnitee or Indemnitees. Except as
reasonably necessary to assist it in defending or settling such Third Party
Action, the Indemnitee shall not be required to disclose any information with
respect to itself or any of its Affiliates (or former Affiliates), and the
Indemnitee shall not be required to participate in the defense of any claim to
be indemnified hereunder (except as otherwise expressly set forth herein),
unless otherwise reasonably required or necessary in the defense of any claim
to be indemnified hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall any Indemnitee be obligated to make any
disclosure, or to take or refrain from taking any action, that in its
reasonable judgment, could prejudice its position or waive any privilege in
respect of any claim for indemnification against the Indemnitor pursuant
to this _Section 5.04_. All costs and expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in
connection with any access or cooperation requested by the Indemnitor shall be
borne by the Indemnitor. The Purchaser and the Seller shall reasonably
cooperate to attempt to resolve or mitigate Damages with respect to any such
Third Party Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall a partys
compliance with the foregoing obligation to reasonably cooperate be a basis
for any claim that any such party shall have waived, limited, relinquished or
otherwise impaired, any rights such party may have pursuant to this Agreement
or be raised as a defense to any such rights.



 

17 (v) In the event the Indemnitor shall request that an Indemnitee participate
in the defense or settlement of an Indemnification Event, the Indemnitor
shall pay the costs incurred by the Indemnitee.



(vi) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Seller, have the
sole right to (x) defend any Action in respect of a Non-Assumable Claim and
(y) settle or otherwise dispose of any Non-Assumable Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall conduct the defense or settlement of Non-
Assumable Claims diligently and in good faith. With respect to any Non-
Assumable Claim that the Purchaser is defending, settling or otherwise
disposing of, the Seller shall be permitted to participate at its own expense
in the defense of such Non-Assumable Claims but shall not be entitled to
assume the defense thereof.



(B) The Purchaser shall keep the Seller timely apprised of the status of all
Non-Assumable Claims and shall notify the Seller promptly of any material
developments (including any material developments relating to settlements and
proposed settlements) relating to a Non-Assumable Claim. Without limiting the
foregoing, no more frequently than once a fiscal quarter, the Purchaser shall
provide the Seller with a written report summarizing in reasonable detail
the status of any pending Non-Assumable Claims (including a summary of any
material settlement discussions). Without limitation of the foregoing,
promptly after the receipt by the Purchaser of a Qualifying Offer relating to
a Non-Assumable Claim, the Purchaser shall promptly provide the Seller with a
copy of such Qualifying Offer or, in the case of an oral Qualifying Offer, a
written summary thereof. In the event that the Purchaser receives a Qualifying
Offer relating to a Non-Assumable Claim that (1) includes a full, final and
unconditional release of the Purchaser from all Damages with respect thereto
and (2) requires only (a) the payment of money for which, as between the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, the Seller has sole liability under this Agreement (a " _Monetary
Settlement_ ") or (b) a Monetary Settlement and any action by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates (any such offer of compromise, a " _Non-Assumable Claim
Offer_ "), then the Seller shall have no further liability to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties with respect to such Non-Assumable Claim upon receipt by
the Purchaser of (x) the amount contained in such Non-Assumable Claim Offer
and all other Damages suffered or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
in respect of such Non-Assumable Claim, in the form of immediately available
funds from the Seller, (y) a fully executed agreement of the Seller and its
Affiliates agreeing to the terms of the actions to be taken by the Seller or
any of its Affiliates pursuant to such Non-Assumable Claim Offer, if any, and
(z) if the Purchaser has accepted the terms of such Non-Assumable Claim Offer,
a full, final and unconditional release, as applicable, of each of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from all liabilities or obligations with respect
thereto, executed by each of the third party claimants in such Non-Assumable
Claim; _provided_ , _ however_ , if the Purchaser has not accepted the terms
of such Non-Assumable Claim Offer, the Seller shall have no further liability
to  



 

18  the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to such Non-Assumable Claim
upon receipt by the Purchaser from the Seller of the amounts and agreements
set forth in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y).



(C) At any time during the defense by the Purchaser of a Non-Assumable Claim,
the Seller shall have the right to require the Purchaser (1) to proffer to the
third party claimants under such Non-Assumable Claim, a written offer of
compromise that consists solely of the payment of money for which, as between
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the
other hand, the Seller has sole liability under this Agreement and/or any
action by the Seller or any of its Affiliates in exchange for a full, final
and unconditional release from such claimants of the Purchaser from all
Liability with respect thereto, and (2) if such offer of compromise is
accepted by such third party claimants, to settle such Non-Assumable Claim on
the terms contained in such offer of compromise, including the full, final and
unconditional release of the Purchaser from all liabilities and obligations
with respect thereto.



(i) Any payments under _Section 5.04_ shall be treated by the parties hereto
for federal, state and local income Tax purposes (whether foreign or domestic)
as a non-taxable reimbursement or purchase price adjustment, except to the
extent that a contrary treatment is required by Law.



(j) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to claims based on fraud and/or
claims seeking non-monetary equitable remedies, the indemnification remedies
set forth in this Agreement (including the repurchase rights in respect of
_Section 2.07_ and _Section 5.04(b)(v)_ ), shall constitute the sole
and exclusive monetary remedies of the parties hereto after the Closing with
respect to any breach of representation, warranty or obligation under this
Agreement. Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Exhibit
B_ , _Exhibit C_ and the Program Documentation, none of the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates or the Seller or any of its Affiliates makes or has made any
representations or warranties, whether express or implied, oral or written,
with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the ABS Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 5.05. _Preparation of Closing Date Schedule and Final Adjusted Closing
Date Schedule_.



(a) _Preparation of Closing Date Schedule_.



(i) As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Purchaser
shall prepare, with the cooperation and assistance of the Seller, a draft of
the Closing Date Schedule. The Closing Date Schedule shall reflect the
Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities. The draft of the Closing Date
Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if the Accounting Principles do not
specifically address a particular matter necessary to prepare the Closing Date
Schedule, then the Accounting Principles shall be supplemented in accordance
with GAAP, applied consistently with the  



 

19  past practices and procedures of IOS Capital, but only to the extent
necessary to address such matter and (B) to the extent that any accounting
principle, method, practice or procedure included in the Accounting
Principles is not in accordance with GAAP, such accounting principle, method,
practice or procedure shall be disregarded for purposes of preparing the
Closing Date Schedule but shall be treated as a Special Adjustment for
purposes of preparing the Final Adjusted Closing Date Schedule. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the draft of the Closing Date Schedule to be completed within 60
days following the Closing Date and, upon completion, such draft schedule
shall promptly be provided to the Purchasers Accountants, the Seller and the
Sellers Accountants.



(ii) Immediately following the preparation and distribution of the draft
of the Closing Date Schedule, the Purchaser shall cause the Purchasers
Accountants to audit the draft Closing Date Schedule, and such audit shall be
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and shall
be sufficient to permit the Purchasers Accountants to deliver a special
report certifying that the Closing Date Schedule fairly presents the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, qualified only to the extent, if any, that the
Purchasers Accountants deem such qualification necessary on account of any
dispute between the Purchasers Accountants and the Sellers Accountants that
is resolved by the conflict resolution mechanism set forth in _Section
5.05(b)_ or agreed by the Purchaser and the Seller, in either case, in a
manner that in the Purchasers Accountants sole judgment precludes the
Purchasers Accountants from issuing an unqualified certification. The
Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Purchasers Accountants to
deliver the draft audited Closing Date Schedule to each of the Seller, the
Sellers Accountants and the Purchaser within 60 days following the date of
their receipt of the draft of the Closing Date Schedule.



(iii) Concurrently with the preparation and delivery to the Purchaser, the
Seller and the Sellers Accountants of the draft of the audited Closing Date
Schedule, the Purchaser shall cause the Purchasers Accountants to
prepare (after consultation with the Purchaser, the Seller and the Sellers
Accountants ), and to deliver to the Purchaser, the Seller and the Sellers
Accountants, a draft of the adjusted Closing Date Schedule that reflects the
Special Adjustments. The Special Adjustments shall be applied in creating the
draft of the adjusted Closing Date Schedule, whether or not the Sellers
Accountants or the Purchasers Accountants believe the Special Adjustments are
or are not in accordance with GAAP or are or are not in accordance with the
historic practices of the Business. During the 30 day period following their
receipt of each of the draft audited Closing Date Schedule and the draft
adjusted Closing Date Schedule reflecting the Special Adjustments
(collectively, the " _Draft Closing Statements_ "), both the Purchaser (in
consultation with the Purchasers Accountants) and the Seller (in consultation
with the Sellers Accountants) shall have the opportunity to review the Draft
Closing Statements (together with the Purchasers Accountants working papers,
including any portion thereof pertaining to any proposed  



 

20  adjustment) and, during such 30 day period, the Seller, the Purchaser and
the Sellers Accountants shall have the right to propose to the Purchasers
Accountants those changes to the Draft Closing Statements that the Seller, the
Purchaser or the Sellers Accountants determine to be appropriate in order to
cause the Draft Closing Statements to conform, in all respects, to
the standards set forth in _Section 5.5(a)(i)_ and _5.5(a)(iii)_ , as
applicable.



(iv) In the event of any dispute between the Seller and the Sellers
Accountants, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Purchasers
Accountants, on the other hand, regarding any of the adjustments proposed by
the Seller or the Sellers Accountants, on the one hand, or the Purchaser or
the Purchasers Accountants, on the other hand, with respect to any item of
the Draft Closing Statements, which the Seller and the Sellers Accountants,
on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Purchasers Accountants, on the
other hand, cannot resolve within 45 days after the receipt thereof, as the
case may be, either the Seller or the Purchaser shall have the right,
upon delivery of written notice to the other party, to require that such
dispute be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section
5.05(b)_. Promptly following the resolution of any disputes with respect to
any proposed adjustments to the Draft Closing Statements, the Purchaser shall
cause the Purchasers Accountants to prepare and deliver to the Seller and the
Purchaser the final audited Closing Date Schedule and the Final Adjusted
Closing Date Schedule (collectively, the " _Final Closing Statements_ "),
each of which shall reflect all adjustments thereto which have been agreed
upon by the Seller and the Sellers Accountants, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser and the Purchasers Accountants, on the other hand, or which have
been resolved pursuant to _Section 5.5(b)_ , together with the Purchasers
Accountants special report on each Final Closing Statement.



(v) Each of the Purchaser, the Seller, the Purchasers Accountants and the
Sellers Accountants shall have full access to all relevant accounting,
financial and other records and personnel reasonably requested by it in
connection with the preparation, confirmation or review of the Draft Closing
Statements, as well as to the Purchasers Accountants working papers with
respect thereto and special report thereon.



(b) _Conflict Resolution Mechanism_. Any dispute involving any adjustment to
the Draft Closing Statement proposed by the Seller, the Sellers Accountants,
the Purchaser or the Purchasers Accountants (including any interpretation or
application of any provision of this Agreement affecting the preparation of
the Draft Closing Statement) not resolved by the Seller, the
Sellers Accountants, the Purchaser and the Purchasers Accountants within 45
days of the relevant date of receipt thereof, shall upon the election of the
Seller or the Purchaser, be resolved by the Selected Accounting Firm. The
Selected Accounting Firm shall resolve only issues upon which the Purchaser,
the Purchasers Accountants, the Seller and the Sellers Accountants have been
unable to agree. The Selected Accounting Firm shall be prohibited from
changing any item of the Draft Closing Statements expressly agreed among the
Purchaser, the Purchasers Accountants, the Seller and the Sellers
Accountants. The Selected  



 

21  Accounting Firm (i) in resolving any issue with respect to the Closing Date
Schedule, shall apply the Accounting Principles in all instances,
including whether or not the Selected Accounting Firm believes the Accounting
Principles are or are not in accordance with the historic practices of the
Business or (subject to the Special Adjustments) are or are not in accordance
with GAAP and (ii) in resolving any issue with respect to the adjusted
Closing Date Schedule, the Selected Accounting Firm shall apply the Special
Adjustments, whether or not the Selected Accounting Firm believes the Special
Adjustments are or are not in accordance with the historic practices of the
Business or are or are not in accordance with GAAP. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause the decision of
such Selected Accounting Firm to be rendered within 20 Business Days after
appointment of the Selected Accounting Firm. The decision of the Selected
Accounting Firm shall be submitted in writing and shall be final and binding
upon the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate of all
amounts in dispute with respect to all disputes referred to in this _Section
5.05(b)_ shall be less than $100,000, such disputes shall not be resolved by
the Selected Accounting Firm, but shall instead be resolved as follows: 50% of
the aggregate of all amounts in dispute shall be deemed to have been resolved
in the Sellers favor and 50% of the aggregate of all amounts in dispute shall
be deemed to have been resolved in the Purchasers favor.



(c) _Payment of Fees_. (i) The Purchaser shall pay all of the fees of the
Purchasers Accountants and all expenses incurred by such firm in connection
with the tasks outlined in this _Section 5.05_ , and the Seller shall pay all
fees of the Sellers Accountants and all expenses incurred by such firm
in connection with the tasks outlined in this _Section 5.05_. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall each pay one-half of the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with any disputes that are resolved by the Selected Accounting Firm
pursuant to  _Section 5.05(b)_.



(ii) On the date of the delivery of the Closing Date Schedule in accordance
with Section 5.05(a), the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account designated to the Seller in writing by the
Purchaser prior to such delivery date).



(d)  _Cooperation_. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Sellers Accountants
and the Purchasers Accountants to cooperate with each other in connection
with all of their activities undertaken in connection with this _Section
5.05_.



(e) _System and Data Back-up_. The Seller Entities shall take or cause to be
taken commercially reasonable actions necessary to complete, at or prior to
the Closing Date at a time to be mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the
Purchaser, an archival back-up onto appropriate electronic storage media of
(i) all Business Technology and the Sellers ORACLE "Financial System"
(accounts payable system) and (ii) all material databases, file servers and
other computer hardware systems used by or on behalf of the Seller Entities to
support the operation of the Business Technology and the Sellers ORACLE
"Financial System" (accounts payable system), including the IOSC
Unix Hardware, the IOSC OS/390 Hardware, the NT Hardware-IDC Support, and the
 



 

22  Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) system. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Seller Entities shall not be required pursuant to this 
_Section 5.05(e)_ to make any copy of any Business Technology if the making of
such copy would violate any license agreement applicable to such Business
Technology. The Seller or IOS Capital shall promptly deliver such electronic
storage media to the Purchaser upon completion of all archival back-up
activities.



Section 5.06. _Insurance; Risk of Loss_. (a) Except in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practices, the Seller shall neither terminate
nor cause to terminate or allow to be terminated (subject to applicable Law)
any occurrence liability policies with respect to the Purchased Assets and ABS
Assets so as to prevent the Purchaser from recovering under such policies for
losses from events occurring prior to the Closing, to the extent that coverage
for such losses was otherwise provided by any such policy.



(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.06(a)_ , to the extent that (i) any insurance
policies owned or controlled by the Seller (collectively, the " _Seller s
Insurance Policies_") cover any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to, any
Purchased Asset or ABS Asset (the " _Seller Liabilities_ ") and resulting
from, arising out of, based on or relating to occurrences prior to the Closing
and (ii) the Sellers Insurance Policies permit claims to be made thereunder
with respect to Seller Liabilities resulting from, arising out of, based on or
relating to occurrences prior to the Closing (the " _Seller Claims_ "), the
Seller shall cooperate and shall cause its Affiliates to cooperate with the
Purchaser, in submitting Seller Claims (or pursuing Seller Claims previously
made) on behalf of the Purchaser under any Sellers Insurance Policies.



Section 5.07. _Pre-Closing Actions_. Effective as of the time immediately

(e) Since September 30, 2003, there has been no change in the Risk Management
Policy For Leasing.



Section 3.08. _Employee Benefit Plans, Etc_.



(a) The Seller has previously delivered to the Purchaser a complete and

Multiemployer Plan subject to Section 4063 and 4064 of ERISA, and neither the
IKON Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to contribute to, or
has any withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.08(a)_ ,
none of the Seller Benefit Plans are sponsored, or have ever been sponsored,
or maintained, or have ever been maintained, by IOS Capital. There is no
amount or payment arising from or in connection with any Seller Benefit Plan,
including any Seller Title IV Plan, with respect to which any of the
Purchaser or the Acquiring Entities are or will be liable to any Person,
including any Governmental Entity or any employee of any of the Seller, IOS

all Taxes shown as due and payable to any Governmental Entity, relating to
the Purchased Assets and the ABS Assets or have provided for all such Taxes
on their books and records and in accordance with the Accounting Principles,

and the ABS Assets, for any period for which Tax Returns have not yet been
filed, or for which Taxes are not yet due or owing or which are being
contested in good faith, the Seller and IOS Capital have made due and
sufficient current accruals for such Taxes on their books and records and in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, including the Financial Statements;



(b) To the Knowledge of the Seller, neither the Seller nor IOS Capital has
received any notice from any taxing authority that it is conducting or
intends to conduct an audit or investigation with respect to the Purchased
Assets or the ABS Assets. No issue has been raised by a taxing authority in
any current or prior examination which, by application of the same or similar
principles, would reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency
for any post-Closing period with respect to the Purchased Assets or the ABS
Assets. There are no outstanding waivers in writing or comparable material
binding consents regarding the application of any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes relating to any Purchased Assets or the ABS Assets. No claim
has been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Seller or
IOS Capital does not file Tax Returns to the effect that the Seller or IOS
Capital is, or may be subject to taxation by that Governmental Entity by
reason of any Purchased Asset;



(c) None of the Purchased Assets or the ABS Assets is a debt obligation that

7701(i) of the Code, or (ii) an interest in a partnership, trust or REMIC
within the meaning of Section 7701(a) of the Code; and

stated in such Tax-Exempt Public Sector Financing Contract and (ii) all
filings with the IRS or other Governmental Entity as are necessary to preserve
the tax exempt nature of such interest have been made, including Form 8038 G
or Form 8038 GC.



Section 3.10.  _Real Property_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ , none
of the Purchased Assets are comprised of a fee or leasehold interest in any
real Property. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ , the Seller has good
and valid title in the leasehold interests set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ (such
interests and the premises with respect thereto, the " _Real Properties_ ",
and each a " _Real Property_ "), free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than (i) the Encumbrances described in clauses (i), (iii) and (vi) of
the definition of Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) such Encumbrances as may be set
forth in _Schedule 3.10_ , as may be updated by a title search prior to the

Seller (as successor by merger to IOS Capital)) currently uses the space and
facilities described on _Schedule 3.10_ and, other than as set forth on
_Schedule 3.10(i)_ or as contemplated by the Program Documentation, no other
space or facility is used by IOS Capital (or, after giving effect to the Pre-
Closing Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to IOS Capital)) in
connection with the conduct or operation of the Business."



 

Section 3.11. _Personal Property_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11_ ,
all material tangible personal Property of the Business is in sufficient
operating condition to continue the operations of the Business in the ordinary
and usual course of business consistent with past practices of the applicable
Seller Entity. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11_ , the applicable Seller
Entity owns and has good title to all owned tangible personal Property of the
Business, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than those Encumbrances
described in clauses (i), (iii) and (vi) of the definition of Permitted
Encumbrances. All leases of material tangible personal Property of which IOS
Capital (and, after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller (as
successor by merger to IOS Capital)) is the lessee or obligor and which are
utilized in connection with the conduct and operation of the Business are in
full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms (subject to
such modification to such leases necessary for the replacement and
substitution of such personal Property in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with IOS Capitals past practices) and there are no outstanding
defaults by any IKON Party thereunder (nor to the Seller Entities Knowledge
are any of the other parties thereto in default); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that this _Section 3.11_ shall not apply to Purchased Financing Contracts or
Portfolio Property, such items being the subject of _Sections 3.18_ and _3.19_
, respectively.

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ , no IKON Party is, nor to the
Seller Entities Knowledge is any other party, in material breach of or in
material default under any Material Contract and no event has occurred which,
with notice and/or lapse of time, would constitute a material default by an
IKON Party under any Material Contract. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.12(a)_ , no IKON Party has received any written notice from or given any
written notice to any other party indicating that it or such other party, as
the case may be, is in default under or in breach or violation of any
Material Contract in any material respect.



(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.12(b)_ , neither IOS Capital (and,

merger to IOS Capital)) is party to, bound by or subject to any Material
Contract, and none of such Persons or any ABS Entity is party to, bound by or
subject to any other agreement constituting a Purchased Asset or Assumed
Liability (or an asset or liability of an ABS Entity) of the following kinds:

future payments under all other agreements, contracts or commitments relating
to the same capital project, exceed $100,000, (v) any guarantee or
indemnification by the relevant IKON Party running to any Person which

case, other than the Securitization Documents and the Non-Purchased
Securitization Documents (and, prior to the Closing, the Conduit Facility
Documents) which if consummated on or prior to the date hereof would
result in the exclusion of such Financing Contracts from the Purchased
Assets, (ix) any agreement containing any covenant or provision limiting the
freedom of a Seller Entity or any of its Affiliates to engage in any line of
business or compete with any Person in any geographic area, (x) any
agreement, not made in the ordinary course of business, relating to the sale
or lease of Real Property set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ , (xi) any agreement in

each agreement set forth thereon is valid, binding and enforceable against
the parties thereto in accordance with its terms except to the extent the
foregoing may be limited by the Bankruptcy Exception and, except as otherwise
noted on such Schedule, is in full force and effect without any
material default thereunder by a Seller Entity or, to the Seller Entities
Knowledge, by any other party thereto.



 

B-8 Section 3.13. _Litigation and Liabilities_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.13_ , there are no civil, criminal or administrative Actions pending
(including any counterclaims) or, to the Seller Entities Knowledge,
threatened, against any Seller Entity or ABS Entity relating to or affecting
any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities which if adversely
determined against any such Seller Entity or ABS Entity would reasonably be
likely to result in Damages in excess of $100,000. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.13_ , no Seller Entity and no ABS Entity is or has been the
subject of, nor to the Seller Entities Knowledge, threatened with, any Action
or Order of any Governmental Entity nor to the Seller Entities Knowledge have
there been any investigations or any threat of investigation, in either case
relating to any of the Purchased Assets, ABS Assets or Assumed Liabilities or
the business practices of the Business (including with respect to the
origination, collection, administration, enforcement or foreclosure in respect
of any Purchased Assets or ABS Assets) from October 1, 2002, through the
Closing Date.



Section 3.14. _Intellectual Property_.



(a) _Schedule 3.14(a)_ accurately lists and identifies by registration number
or application number, if applicable, all of the material Intellectual
Property utilized by IOS Capital (and, after giving effect to the Pre-Closing
Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to IOS Capital)) in connection with
the conduct and operations of the Business, other than "shrink-wrap" software
readily available in the marketplace (the " _Business Intellectual Property_
"). The Business Intellectual Property and the rights being conveyed to the
Purchaser pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements represent all material
Intellectual Property that is used in the Business as currently conducted.
Unless otherwise indicated on _Schedule 3.14(a)_ , IOS Capital (and, after
giving effect to the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to
IOS Capital)) exclusively owns the entire right, title and interest in and
to the Business Intellectual Property (including but not limited to the
exclusive right to use and license the same) free and clear of any
Encumbrance, other than (i) Business Intellectual Property of which IOS
Capital and/or the Seller is a licensee, or (ii) licenses granted to Persons
who are authorized licensees under the Business Intellectual Property. Unless
otherwise indicated on _Schedule 3.14(a)_ , following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Acquiring
Entities will have the right to utilize for the uses in which it is currently
employed all Business Intellectual Property of which IOS Capital and/or the
Seller is a licensee, without the necessity of obtaining consent from or
paying a fee to another Person. Unless otherwise indicated on _Schedule
3.14(a)_ , to the Seller Entities Knowledge, no Person other than IOS Capital
(and, after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller (as successor
by merger to IOS Capital)) or the Seller has or has made any claim of
ownership or right to use any of the Business Intellectual Property that is
owned by IOS Capital and/or the Seller, other than those Persons who are
authorized licensees under the Business Intellectual Property. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.14(a)_ , to the Seller Entities Knowledge, no IKON Party
has received any written notices or claims which claim infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property owned or licensed by any Person
other than an IKON Party. No IKON Party is aware of infringement or
misappropriation by any Person of the Business Intellectual Property owned or
used by IOS Capital (and, after giving effect to the Pre-  



 

B-9  Closing Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to IOS Capital)). To the
Seller Entities Knowledge, all Business Intellectual Property is
valid, enforceable and in full force and effect. IOS Capital (and, after
giving effect to the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to
IOS Capital)) has not granted to any Person any license or other rights under
the Business Intellectual Property that would conflict with the terms of this
Agreement or that would interfere with the Purchasers and/or the Acquiring
Entities ability to conduct the Business after the Closing Date.



(b) _Schedule 3.14(b)_ contains a complete and accurate list and description
of all material mainframe, telecommunication and computer programs and
software and related data necessary to perform, as presently performed, the
specific applications and operations which are material to the operation of
the Business as presently conducted (the " _Business Technology_ "). All
Business Technology is either owned or licensed pursuant to a written
licensing agreement by or on behalf of IOS Capital (and, after giving effect
to the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to IOS
Capital)), which licensing agreement (except as indicated on _Schedule
3.14(b)_ ) has been provided to the Purchaser by the Seller or IOS Capital.
_Part 2 of Schedule 3.14(b)_ sets forth all Business Technology owned by the
Seller and used solely in the Business. Each such licensing agreement is a
valid and binding agreement of the Seller or IOS Capital and is in full force
and effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(b)_ , to the Knowledge of
the Seller Entities, none of the Seller, IOS Capital, or any other party
thereto is in default under the terms of any such licensing agreement. Neither
the Seller nor IOS Capital has received notice of any pending or
threatened bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding with respect to any
other party to any such licensing agreement. Unless otherwise indicated on
_Schedule 3.14(b)_ , following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Acquiring Entities will
have the right to utilize all of the Business Technology (i) for the uses in
which it is currently employed (whether through its ownership thereof, or as a
direct licensee thereof under the applicable license agreement); and (ii) at
a site other than the site at which it is currently utilized, in each case
without the necessity of obtaining consent from or paying a fee to another
Person. In the event that IOS Capital and/or the Seller has created a
derivative work based on a program or software listed on _Schedule 3.14(b)_
and owned by any Person other than an IKON Party, IOS Capital and/or the
Seller created said derivative work in connection with proper authority from
that Person.

relate to the ownership, use or operations of any of the Purchased Assets as
of the date hereof, all of which are in full force and effect, and no written
notice of cancellation or non-renewal has been received by any Seller Entity
in respect of any such policies of insurance.

Ancillary Agreements (i) are sufficient for the Purchaser to carry on the

Capital (and after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller (as
successor by merger to IOS Capital)), consistent with its past practices, (ii)

(immediately prior to the Pre-Closing Merger) and (y) the other activities
relating to the Program (as such term is defined in the Program Agreement Term
Sheet) contemplated by the Program Documentation and (iii) except for
Excluded Assets, constitute all of the Property used or held by IOS Capital
(and following the Pre-Closing Merger, the Seller as successor by merger to

servicing of the Financing Contracts constituting the Specified IKON Assets.



Section 3.17. _Conduct of Business_. Since September 30, 2003, IOS Capital has
used reasonable efforts to preserve substantially intact the Business and has
used commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its present relationships
consistent with past practices with (i) each Transferred Employee and (ii)
each Person having any business relationship which is advantageous to
the Business, or the discontinuance of which would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Since September 30, 2003, IOS Capital has
conducted business with its Affiliates only in the ordinary and usual course
and has not dealt with or entered into any contracts, commitments or
arrangements with its Affiliates on terms and conditions less favorable to it
than would be available in a comparable transaction with a Person not an
Affiliate of IOS Capital.

Contract or Credit Enhancement in accordance with its written terms; (ii) no
Seller Entity or ABS Entity is in breach of or default under any Purchased
Financing Contract or Credit Enhancement, and, to the Seller
Entities Knowledge, no other event has occurred which, with notice and/or

Seller Entities has entered into a Purchased Financing Contract for the
purpose of enabling the Obligor under such Purchased Financing Contract to
acquire any interest in or the use of any Portfolio Property pursuant to such
Financing Contract for personal, family, household or agricultural use or (B)
no Obligor is required under any applicable Law to withhold from payments on
such Purchased Financing Contracts any interest or other withholdings for
payment of Taxes to any Governmental Entity; (iv) except for OP Rental
Financing Contracts identified by the codes set forth on _Schedule 3.18(g)_ ,
no Purchased Financing Contract is terminable at the option of the

not less than the present value of all remaining scheduled payments thereunder
discounted at the implicit rate of such Purchased Financing Contract; (v) all
payments pursuant to each Purchased Financing Contract are made directly to a
Seller Entity; and (vi) each Seller Entity has approved credit applications
and otherwise entered into commitments with respect to Purchased Financing
Contracts (including Backlog) in a manner consistent with the Risk Management
Policy For Leasing, collateral eligibility standards, credit quality
classifications and other financing origination policies of IOS Capital in
effect at the time such Purchased Financing Contracts were originated.



(c) No Purchased Financing Contract is subject to any debt subordination
agreement, participation agreement, intercreditor agreement, owner
trust agreement, purchase agreement, collateral sharing agreement, residual
sharing agreement, remarketing agreement or vendor recourse agreement and no
Purchased Financing Contract is subject to any Syndication Agreements, in each
case, that is not in writing and accurately reflected in the credit and legal
files for such Purchased Financing Contract.



(d) _Schedule 3.18(d)_ sets forth a list of each Credit Enhancement that is a
letter of credit with a maximum amount drawable thereunder in excess
of $50,000, in  



 

B-12  the case of any Credit Enhancement in respect of any Financing Contract

Merger, the Seller (as successor by merger to IOS Capital)) has collateral
monitoring systems which accurately reflect and track the expiration dates of
all Credit Enhancements in respect of the Purchased Assets and ABS Assets
which are in the form of letters of credit.



(e) Each Purchased Financing Contract and Credit Enhancement comprising part

a state of the United States, and each Obligor under a Purchased Financing
Contract comprising part of the Purchased Assets or the ABS Assets is located
in the United States.

against the Seller as a result of IOS Capital originating such Financing
Contract, at the request of the Seller, despite material noncompliance of

Management Policy for Leasing in effect at the time such Financing Contract
was originated. Upon a Financing Contract being included in IOS Capitals
"Historic Exceptions List", such Financing Contract remains on such list
until such Financing Contract is paid (including paid upon upgrade of the
relevant equipment), written off or repurchased by the Seller.

respect of such Portfolio Property, and no Seller Entity has
amended, cancelled, modified, assigned or encumbered any of such warranties
(other than as provided in the related Purchased Financing Contracts); and

Obligor under a Purchased Financing Contract (and not a Seller Entity or any
other Person) is required to provide insurance against loss or damage with
respect to the Portfolio Property subject to or governed by such Purchased

of material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
