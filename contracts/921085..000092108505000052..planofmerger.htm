all such Contracts, and all amendments thereto, have been made available to VIB.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term &#147;Contracts&#148; will not be

Exception. Except as described in <U>Confidential Schedule 3.11</U>, all rent

Except as set forth on <U>Confidential Schedule 3.28(d)</U>, no transaction
prohibited by ERISA &sect; 406 and no &#147;prohibited transaction&#148; under
Code &sect; 4975(c) has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan. There have
been no breaches of fiduciary duty or any other material breaches or material
violations of any law applicable to the Employee Plans that would subject VIB,
CCB, the Bank or any Employee Plan to any taxes, penalties, or other
liabilities. Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Code

from the IRS that it is qualified under Code &sect; 401(a) as to form and that
its related trust is exempt from federal income tax under Code &sect; 501(a).
Each such Plan materially complies in form and in operation with the
requirements of the Code and meets the requirements of a &#147;qualified
plan&#148; under &sect; 401(a) of the Code. To the knowledge of CCB, no event
has occurred or circumstance exists that will or could give rise to
disqualification or loss of tax exempt status of any such plan or trust. Except
as disclosed on <U>Confidential Schedule 3.28(d)</U>, no Employee Plan holds any
stock or other securities of CCB or the Bank. There are no pending claims,
lawsuits or actions relating to any Employee Plan (other than ordinary course
claims for benefits) and, to the Knowledge of CCB, none are threatened. Except
as disclosed on <U>Confidential Schedule 3.28(d)</U>, none of CCB, the Bank or
any Employee Plan provides (or is obligated to provide) benefits to any employee
or dependent of such employee after the employee terminates employment other
than as required by law. To the knowledge of CCB, except as disclosed on
<U>Confidential Schedule 3.28(d)</U>, no written or oral representations have
been made to any employee or former employee of CCB or the Bank promising or
guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the continuation of medical,
dental, life or disability coverage or any other welfare benefit (as defined in
ERISA &sect; 3(1)) for any period of time beyond the end of the current plan
year (except to the extent of coverage required under Code &sect; 4980B).
Compliance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards 87, 106, 132 and

will not cause a termination or partial termination, or otherwise accelerate the
