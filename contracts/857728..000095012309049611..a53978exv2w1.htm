reasonably designed to ensure that all material information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Company&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and
to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the

management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of SOX for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective.
