-19-  


 

 

SECTION 2.7 _Determination and Allocation of the Merger Consideration_. No
later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
deliver to Parent the  Allocation Schedule. The Allocation Schedule will
provide for the allocation of the Merger Consideration to the Company

will be calculated net of the aggregate balance of each such Company
Shareholder's Employee Loans (including any accrued interest thereon) that
have  not been repaid to the Company or its Subsidiaries by such Company
Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.8 _Payment of the Initial Merger Consideration_.

 


 

 

(a) _Deposit of Funds_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with
this  _Article II_ through the Paying Agent, cash in an amount equal to the
Initial Merger Consideration _minus_ the Aggregate Employee Loan Amount. Such
funds will  be invested by the Paying Agent if and as directed by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the
Company Shareholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such
cash will be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States in commercial paper obligations  rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, in

commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion,  or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing, and, in any such case, no such instrument will have a maturity 
exceeding three months, and that no such investment or loss thereon will
affect the amounts payable to the Company Shareholders pursuant to _Sections
2.6(b)_ and _2.11(e)_   (if any) and to the extent of any such loss, Parent
will promptly fund additional cash amounts to the Paying Agent sufficient to
enable payment of such amounts. Earnings from such investments will be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent and  the Surviving Corporation, and no
part of such earnings will accrue to the benefit of the Company Shareholders.

 


 

 

(b) _Payment of the Initial Merger Consideration_. At the Closing or as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date Parent will cause the Paying Agent
to pay to  each Company Shareholder that holds Class A Shares or Class B
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount equal to the portion
of the Initial Merger Consideration allocable in respect of such Class A
Shares or Class B Shares of such  Company Shareholder (which amount will be
set forth in the Allocation Schedule) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of such Company Shareholder identified in the
Letter of Transmittal for such Company Shareholder.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-20-  


 

 

(c) _Exchange Procedure_. Prior to the Closing, the Company will cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Company Shareholder a letter of transmittal,
which will be  in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit F_ , with such
changes as may be agreed to between the Company and Parent prior to the
Closing or as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "). Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in _Article
VII_ , in the event that at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date
a  Company Shareholder of (i) Class A Shares or (ii) Class B Shares delivers
to the Paying Agent a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, then
such Company Shareholder will be entitled to receive on the Closing Date the
cash payments such  Company Shareholder is entitled to pursuant to _Section
2.8(b)_. Any Initial Merger Consideration not paid at Closing due to failure
by a Company Shareholder to deliver a duly executed and completed  Letter of
Transmittal at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date will be held
by the Paying Agent until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed
Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent. Upon delivery of such duly
executed  Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent, such Company Shareholder
will be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Initial Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement
in respect of his, her or its  Class A Shares or Class B Shares, as
applicable, no later than five Business Days after the date the Paying Agent
receives such duly executed Letter of Transmittal.

 


 

 

(d) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the funds made available to the
Paying Agent which remains undistributed to Company Shareholders 12 months
after the  Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or
its designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Effective Time who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ will  thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of
their claims for Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Shareholders' Representative, the Paying Agent or any other
Person  will be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

 


 

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ will be  deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares, and, from and
after the Effective Time, the Company Shareholders will cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares, except as otherwise  expressly
provided for in this Agreement. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company will be closed, and thereafter there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of any
shares of  the Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.9 _Dissenting Shareholder_. Any holder of Class A Shares or Class B
Shares who perfects such holder's appraisal rights in accordance with and as
contemplated by  Sections 1571 through 1580 of the PBCL (such holder, a "
_Dissenting Shareholder_ ") will be entitled to receive from Parent, in lieu
of such

 


 

 


 

 

 

-21-   
   

Dissenting Shareholder's portion of the Merger Consideration allocated to such
Dissenting Shareholder in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_ ,  the value of
such Company Shares as to which dissenters' rights have been perfected (such
Company Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), in each case, in cash as
determined pursuant to such provision of the  PBCL; _provided_ that no such
payment will be made to any Dissenting Shareholder unless and until such
Dissenting Shareholder has complied with all applicable provisions of the
PBCL, and surrendered to  Parent the certificate or certificates representing
the Class A Shares or Class B Shares (as applicable) for which payment is
being made. In the event that after the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shareholder fails to perfect, or effectively  withdraws or loses, such
Dissenting Shareholder's right to appraisal of and payment for such Dissenting
Shareholder's Dissenting Shares, each of such Dissenting Shareholder's
Dissenting Shares, as the case may be, will thereupon be treated as  though
such Class A Shares or Class B Shares had been converted into the right to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_.
The Company will give prompt notice to Parent  of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any Class A Shares or Class B Shares, and Parent will
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,  the Company will
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.10 _Other Settlements_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent will
pay, or cause to be paid, (a) the unpaid Transaction Costs by wire transfer of
immediately  available funds as directed by the Company at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, (b) the Estimated Company Indebtedness by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated in any
payoff letters or other  customary documentation evidencing the repayment or
redemption of the Estimated Company Indebtedness delivered in accordance with
_Section 6.19_ , (c) the Escrow Funds into an escrow account to be held by 
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and (d) the Shareholders' Representative's Expense Funds by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the Shareholders'

avoidance of doubt, each Company Shareholder's outstanding Employee Loans as
of the Effective Time, if any, will be satisfied in full simultaneously upon
the completion of the payments to  be made pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_.

 


 

 

SECTION 2.11 _Adjustment_.

Company Cash as of the Reference Time, but giving effect to any cash 
dividends or distributions after the Reference Time and prior to the Closing
(such estimate, the " _Estimated Company Cash_ "), (B) the unpaid Transaction
Costs as of the Closing (such estimate, the " _Estimated Transaction Costs_
"), (C) the Indebtedness of the Company as of the Reference Time, but giving
effect to any incurrence of

 


 

 


 

 

 

-22-  


 

 

Indebtedness after the Reference Time and prior to the Closing (such estimate,
the " _Estimated Company Indebtedness_ ")         and (D) Net Working
Capital as of the Reference Time determined in accordance with the Agreed
Accounting Principles and Sample Net Working Capital Statement (such estimate,
the " _Estimated Working Capital_ ");         and (ii) the resulting
calculation of the Initial Merger Consideration.

 


 

 

(b) _Closing Statement_. Within 90 calendar days after the Effective Time,
Parent will prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to
the  Shareholders' Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "),
setting forth Parent's calculation of: (i) Company Cash as of the Reference
Time, but giving effect to any cash dividends or  distributions after the
Reference Time and prior to the Closing (as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.11(b)_ and _Section 2.11(c)_ , the " _Final Company Cash_ "),
(ii) the unpaid Transaction Costs as of the Closing (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.11(b_ ) and _Section 2.11(c)_ , the " _Final
Transaction Costs_ "), (iii) the Indebtedness of the Company as of the
Reference Time, but giving effect to any incurrence of Indebtedness after
the  Reference Time and prior to the Closing (as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.11(b)_ and _Section 2.11(c)_ , the " _Final        
Company Indebtedness_ "), (iv) the Net Working Capital as of the Reference
Time, prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles and the
Sample Net Working Capital Statement (as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.11(b)_ and _Section 2.11(c)_ , the " _Final Working Capital_ ") and
(v) a line by line reconciliation of the  Estimated Company Cash and the
Final Company Cash, the Estimated Transaction Costs and Final Transaction
Costs, the Estimated Company Indebtedness and Final Company Indebtedness and
the Estimated Working Capital and the Final Working Capital,  respectively.
The determination of Final Company Cash, Final Transaction Costs, Final
Company Indebtedness and Final Working Capital will be based solely on facts
and circumstances as they are known to exist prior to the Effective Time and
will  exclude the effect of any fact, event, change, circumstance, act or
decision occurring at or after the Effective Time. If for any reason Parent
fails to deliver the Closing Statement within 60 days after the Effective
Time, then the Pre-Closing  Statement prepared and delivered by or on behalf
of the Company to Parent prior to the Effective Time will be considered the
Closing Statement for all purposes of this Agreement from which the
Shareholders' Representative will have all of its  rights under this _Section
2.11_ with respect thereto, including the right to dispute the calculations
set forth therein in accordance with the provisions set forth in
_Section         2.11(c)_.

 


 

 

(c) _Dispute_. Following receipt of the Closing Statement, the Shareholders'
Representative will have 60 calendar days (the " _Review        
Period_ ") to review the Closing Statement. In connection with the review of
the Closing Statement, Parent will give, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to give,
to the  Shareholders' Representative and its representatives prompt
reasonable access to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the
personnel of, and work papers prepared by or for, Parent and the Company or
their respective Affiliates or

 


 

 


 

 

 

 

-23-  

 

 


 

 

representatives, including to such historical financial information relating
to any of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries as 
Shareholders' Representative or its representatives may request, in each case,
in order to permit the timely and complete review of the Closing Statement by
the Shareholders' Representative in accordance with this
_Section         2.11(c)_. If the Shareholders' Representative has
accepted such the Closing Statement in writing or has not given written notice
to Parent setting forth any objection of the Shareholders' Representative to
such Closing Statement (a " _Statement of Objections_ ") prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Closing Statement will be final and
binding upon the parties. In the event that the Shareholders' Representative
delivers a  Statement of Objections during the Review Period, each of Parent
and Shareholders' Representative will work in good faith to resolve such
objections within 30 calendar days following the receipt by Parent of such
Statement of Objections (any  unresolved objection following such 30 calendar
day period, a " _Dispute_ "). After such 30 calendar day period, any item or
matter that is not a Dispute will become final and binding. If Parent and
the  Shareholders' Representative are unable to resolve all Disputes during
such 30 calendar day period, then any remaining Disputes, and only such
remaining Disputes, will be resolved by Grant Thornton LLP or, if such Person
is not available for such  engagement or at the time of such proposed
engagement is no longer independent, such other nationally recognized
independent certified public accounting firm reasonably agreed to by Parent
and the Shareholders' Representative (Grant Thornton LLP or  such other
accounting firm agreed to by Parent and Shareholders' Representative, the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). If Parent and the Shareholders' Representative cannot
agree on an accounting firm within 40  calendar days of determining that an
Accounting Firm other than Grant Thornton LLP must be appointed as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, then the Shareholders' Representative
and/or Parent may submit a request to the American Arbitration  Association
requesting appointment of a nationally recognized independent certified public
accounting firm to serve as the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm will act
as an expert and not an arbitrator and will be instructed to resolve within
45  calendar days after its appointment any such remaining Disputes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the Agreed Accounting
Principles, the Sample Net Working Capital Statement and the books and records
of the Company and its  Subsidiaries. The resolution of such Disputes by the
Accounting Firm will: (i) be set forth in a reasoned written report; (ii) be
within the range of values established for such amount as determined by
reference to the value assigned to such  amount by the Shareholders'
Representative in the Statement of Objections and by Parent in the Closing
Statement (to the extent such item was included therein, and in the event such
item was not included therein, such amount assigned to such item  will be
deemed to be zero); (iii) constitute an arbitral award; and (iv) be conclusive
and binding upon all of the parties (absent manifest error) upon which a
judgment may be rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of Parent
and the  Shareholders' Representative agrees that it will not have any right
to, and will not, institute any Proceeding of any kind challenging such
determination by the Accounting Firm, except that the foregoing will not
preclude a Proceeding to

 


 

 

 

-24-  


 

 

enforce such determination or to challenge the Accounting Firm's determination
on the ground that such determination is inconsistent with the terms of  this
Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this _Section 2.11(c)_ will be borne by the non-prevailing party,
which will be the party whose values assigned  and submitted to the
Accounting Firm with respect to any amounts in Dispute is furthest from that
determined by the Accounting Firm; provided that if the Shareholders'
Representative is the non-prevailing party, then the Shareholders' 
Representative will satisfy the payment of all such fees, costs and expenses
solely out of the Escrow Funds and the Shareholders' Representative will not
be individually liable with respect to such amounts. The date on which the
Closing Statement  is finally determined and delivered in accordance with
this _Section 2.11(c)_ is hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination
Date_."

 


 

 

(d) _Access_. For the purpose of complying with the terms set forth in
_Section 2.11(c)_ , Parent, on the one hand, and  the Shareholders'
Representative, on the other hand, will, and will cause their respective
representatives, including their respective accountants, to, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and representatives, 
including their respective accountants, to, cooperate with and make available
to the Accounting Firm and each other and their respective representatives,
including their respective accountants, interviews with such individuals and
all information,  records, data and work papers, and will permit access to
its facilities, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation and review of the Closing Statement and the resolution of any
Disputes thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the accountants of each of
Parent, the Shareholders' Representative and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will not be obligated to make any  work papers available to each
other or their respective representatives, including their respective
accountants, or the Accounting Firm except in accordance with such
accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only after the proposed 
recipient has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. If
Parent, on the one hand, or the Shareholders' Representative, on the other
hand, breach their  respective obligations under this _Section 2.11(d)_ , the

Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of their 
applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Tax Law; provided that prior to making any such
deduction or withholding, the  applicable withholding entity will provide
notice, at least 10 days prior to the Closing Date, to the recipient of the
amounts subject to withholding and a reasonable opportunity for such recipient
to provide forms or evidence that would exempt  such amounts from withholding
Tax. Any amounts so withheld and paid over to an applicable Governmental
Authority as required by applicable Law will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which  such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any
of their applicable Subsidiaries or the Paying Agent.

 


 

 

(b) (i) Parent and the Company agree, (A) as soon as practicable but no later
than 25 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, to jointly submit or
cause to be submitted, on behalf of Parent and the  Company Shareholders that
are not individuals, to the relevant PRC Governmental Authority the Tax
reports and other documentation required under Article 9 of Announcement 7
(the " _Indirect Transfer Tax Filing  Documents_ ") relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Joint Filing_ "); (B) that
the Company will prepare the draft of the Indirect Transfer Tax Filing
Documents for  the review and comment by Parent; and (C) at least 10 calendar
days prior to making such submission, (x) jointly determine the timing and
venue of such submission and (y) jointly determine the final version of the
Indirect Transfer Filing Documents  to be submitted to the competent PRC
Governmental Authority; provided, however, that Parent shall be entitled to
submit or cause to be submitted the Indirect Transfer Tax Filing Documents to
the competent PRC Governmental Authority on an  individual basis if the Joint
Filing does not take place within 25 calendar days after the date of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

(ii) if the Company or Parent receives any written communication from any
competent PRC Governmental Authority in relation to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Joint Filing, such recipient will
promptly  forward the communication to the Company or Parent, as applicable.
The Company and Parent agree to cooperate with each other in respect of the
Joint Filing. If the Company or Parent receives a written notification from
the competent PRC  Governmental Authority prior to the Closing which
determines that Parent is required to withhold Chinese WHT, Parent will deduct
an amount equal to such Chinese WHT in accordance with Section 2.12(a).

 


 

 

SECTION 2.13 _Tax Treatment_. For all Tax purposes, each Company Shareholder
will be treated as receiving the full amount of their allocated portion of the
Merger  Consideration (without any reduction with respect to any Employee
Loans of such Company Shareholder) in exchange for their Company Shares in the
Merger and then immediately thereafter, if applicable, using a portion of such
Merger Consideration

 


 

 

 

 

-27-

(including any accrued interest thereon) that have not been repaid to the

SECTION 5.6 _Financial Resources; Solvency_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the fully
executed debt commitment letter, together with any related fee letters (in the
case of the fee letters, redacted in a customary  manner), dated as of the
date of this Agreement, between Barclays and Parent providing for debt
financing as described therein (together, including all exhibits, schedules
and annexes, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "),         pursuant to
which, upon the terms and subject solely to the conditions set forth therein,
Barclays has agreed to lend the amounts set forth therein, for the purpose of,
among other things, paying the Merger Amounts (as defined below). As of the 
date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect
and constitutes the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and,
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its  terms, in each case, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the
full amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
other than the conditions precedent set  forth the Debt Commitment Letter
(such conditions precedent, the " _Financing Conditions_ "). As of the date of
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in
any manner, and  the respective commitments contained therein have not been
terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect by Parent or, to
the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, and no such termination,

date of this Agreement, assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company made to Parent such that the condition set forth 
in Section 7.2(a) is satisfied, (ii) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1
are satisfied and (iii) the Company's compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) and
Section 7.2(c) are  satisfied, Parent has no reason to believe that (A) any
of the Debt Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on or prior to the
Closing Date or (B) the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter will not be available to Parent on  the Closing Date. As of the date
of this Agreement, Parent is not in default or breach under the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter. Except for an engagement letter
(which engagement letter does not affect the conditionality or  amount of the
Debt Financing), as of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to funding of the
full amount of the Debt Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates
is  a party that would be reasonably likely to affect the Debt Financing

set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent or an Affiliate thereof on its
behalf has fully paid  any and all commitment or other fees and amounts
required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement. Parent will have at and as of the Closing Date sufficient

discharged in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby) and all premiums and fees required to be paid in
connection therewith and all other amounts to be paid  pursuant to this
Agreement and associated costs and expenses of the Merger (such amounts,
collectively, the " _Merger Amounts_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that the  representation contained in the
immediately preceding sentence will not be true at and as of the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that it is not a condition to the  Closing under this
Agreement for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain any financing (including the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter) for the purpose of
consummating the Merger, including the payment of the Merger Consideration 
and any other amounts payable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

familiar with such uncertainties, (x) Parent is taking full responsibility for

any Person with respect to such any projections, estimates or budgets

liability or obligation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or

documents, forms, filings or submissions required of  such party (or, as
reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company, filings that are advisable to be
made by such party) under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as  promptly
as practicable, and in any event within 15 Business Days in the case of the
HSR Act, after the date of this Agreement, and seek early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with
any  request for additional information, documents or other materials
(including a "second request" under the HSR Act) received by such party from
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the  Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any
other Governmental Antitrust Authority under any applicable Antitrust Laws
with respect to such filings or such  transactions, and (iii) act in good
faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any
such filings and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Antitrust  Authority under
the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. The filing fees relating to any such filings
under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws will be paid by 
Parent.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the
Company, without the other party's prior written consent will (i) enter into
any timing, settlement or similar Contract, or  otherwise agree or commit to
any arrangement, that would have the effect of extending, suspending,
lengthening or otherwise tolling, the expiration or termination of the waiting
period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or (ii) enter into  any
timing or similar Contract, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement,
that would bind or commit the parties not to complete the Merger (or that
would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from completing the Merger);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed to the extent that the purpose of any such Contract or
arrangement  is to extend the waiting period or deadline under an Antitrust
Law in order to satisfy the condition in _Section 7.1(a)_ prior to the
Termination Date. Neither Parent nor the Company will take or permit  any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
receipt of approval under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

 


 

 

(d) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, each of Parent and the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other party all
information required for any application or other  filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other written materials made to or
received from any

 


 

 

 

 

-57-  


   


 

 

applicable Governmental Antitrust Authority; _provided_ that materials may be
redacted (i) to remove  references concerning the valuation of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each  of Parent and the Company will
give the other reasonable and prompt prior notice of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or Contract with, any Governmental
Antitrust Authority regarding any such filings or any such  transaction, and
keep the other informed as to the status of any request, inquiry, objection,
charge or other action, actual or threatened, by or before any Governmental
Antitrust Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company will not independently participate
in any substantive meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with
any Governmental Antitrust Authority in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other  inquiry without giving such other party prompt prior
notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by any such
Governmental Antitrust Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate in
such meeting or conversation. Subject to _Section 6.3(f)_ , each of Parent and
the Company will use its respective reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Antitrust Authority
with respect to  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws. Subject to _Section 6.3(f)_ , each
of Parent and the Company will use its respective reasonable best  efforts to
take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible and
in any  event prior to the Termination Date. Without limiting the generality
of any of the obligations in this _Section 6.3_ , (x) if any Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the Company will, and will cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, cooperate and use reasonable
best  efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Proceeding, and (y)
each of Parent and the Company will, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of (or, if such  is entered, to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned) any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that prohibits, prevents,
restricts or delays the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, including by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, in each case subject
to _Section 6.3(f)_. Subject to  the consent of the Company (which may be
granted or withheld in the Company's sole discretion), Parent will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, defend through litigation on the merits any
Proceeding in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or  terminated, any
decree, Order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section
6.3_ will limit the right of Parent or the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , so

 


 

 


 

 

 

-58-  


 

 

long as Parent or the Company, as applicable, has, up to the time of
termination, complied in all respects with its obligations under this _Section
6.3_.

 


 

 

(e) Parent and the Company will cooperate regarding (i) the strategy for
obtaining any consents, waivers and approvals from any Governmental Antitrust
Authorities concerning the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement and
(ii) the positions to be taken, the regulatory actions to be requested and the
submissions to be made (including, any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) in any filing with  any
Governmental Antitrust Authorities concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any related investigation, inquiry, litigation or other
regulatory matter by or before, or any negotiations with, any Governmental
Antitrust  Authorities.

 


 

 

(f) Parent will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, take all
actions necessary to procure, as promptly as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the Termination Date), clearance  from all Governmental
Antitrust Authorities reviewing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the  sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product
lines or assets of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that, after
the Closing Date, would limit  Parent's or the Company's or their respective
Subsidiaries' or Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or its or
their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Parent, the Company and their respective  Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction, in
any Proceeding under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, which would 
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, and in that regard,
Parent will agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take
or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to
Parent's, the  Company's or their respective Subsidiaries' or Affiliates'
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (all such
actions, " _Remedial Actions_ "). Notwithstanding anything else contained
herein, neither the provisions of this _Section 6.3_ nor any other provision
of this Agreement will be construed to  require Parent or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries to undertake (or to request or authorize the Company or any of
the Company's Subsidiaries to undertake) any Remedial Action that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, individually or taken  together with all
other Remedial Actions, result in a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations or financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including for this purpose the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a 
whole, with material adverse effect measured against an enterprise the size of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (without giving effect to
the Merger). The Company and its Subsidiaries will cooperate with Parent to
implement any  Remedial Actions, and will agree to any Remedial Action to the

 


 

  
 

 

 

-59-  


   

extent and only as directed by Parent, so long as the effectiveness of such
Remedial Action is conditioned on the Closing.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.4 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 


 

 

(a) _Maintenance of Compensation and Benefits_. Subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 6.4_ , for a period of  12 months from and
following the Closing (the " _Relevant Period_ "), Parent will provide (or
cause one of its Affiliates after the Closing to provide) each Continuing
Employee with (i) an annual base salary  or wage rate, (ii) target bonus,
incentive compensation or commission opportunities (excluding any signing,
retention, transaction or other special or one-time bonuses or incentives),
and (iii) other compensation that are each at least equal to his  or her
annual base salary or wage rates, bonus, incentive compensation or commission
opportunities and other compensation in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. In addition, Parent will provide (or cause one of its Affiliates
after the  Closing to provide) to Continuing Employees during the Relevant
Period benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits
provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing. With
respect to any individual  Continuing Employee who enters (or has entered)
into an agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries governing the
compensation and benefits applicable to such individual Continuing Employee,
Parent will maintain the compensation and each  benefit arrangement for the
individual Continuing Employee in accordance with the terms and conditions
thereof, unless further modified by the mutual agreement of Parent and the
individual Continuing Employee. Where required by local Law, Parent  will
either obtain (or cause the Surviving Corporation or the appropriate
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to obtain) the consent of the relevant
Continuing Employee before making any changes to the terms and conditions of
the Continuing  Employee's employment (including compensation and benefits)
following the Closing, or will otherwise make the change in accordance with
local Law.

 


 

 

(b) _Service Credit_. For purposes of determining eligibility, vesting,
benefit accrual and level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its  Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employee
after the Closing (excluding any employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Affiliates that are frozen or otherwise closed to new hires) (the " _New
Plans_ "),         each Continuing Employee will receive full credit
for such Continuing Employee's years of service with the Company and its
Affiliates before the Closing (including predecessor or acquired entities or
any other entities for which the Company and its  Affiliates have given
credit for prior service), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, prior to the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
or comparable Company Plan (except to the extent such credit would  result in
a duplication of benefits). For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent will credit each Continuing Employee with
all paid time off accrued and unused by such Continuing Employee through the
Closing  Date.

 


 

 

 

-60-  


 

 

(c) _Eligibility_. Parent will, to the extent permitted by the applicable plan
documents and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ensure that:
(i) at  such time at or after the Closing that a Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in any New Plan(s), such Continuing Employee will be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in such New
Plan to the extent such  waiting time was satisfied under a similar or
comparable Company Plan in which the Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Closing (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_
"), (ii) all  pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations and actively-
at-work requirements of each New Plan will be waived or satisfied for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or
satisfied under the analogous Old  Plan as of the Closing and (iii) all
eligible expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Continuing Employee's participation in the  corresponding New Plan
begins will be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for 
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 


 

 

(d) _Vacation_. With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which
any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy or
individual  agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (the " _Vacation Policy_ "),
Parent will, or will cause any of its Affiliates after the Closing  to, (i)
allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued vacation and (ii) if any
Continuing Employee's employment terminates during the Relevant Period, pay
the Continuing Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued
vacation  time to the same extent that the Continuing Employee would have
received a cash payment therefor under the Vacation Policy or the applicable
Company Plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(e) _Retiree Medical Benefit Plans_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in _Section 6.4(a)_ , subject to _Section 6.4(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, with respect to former Employees of the Company who were at the time
of their retirement not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and who
at the time  of the Closing are covered under the Company Plans set forth on
_Section 6.4(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, Parent will continue (or
will cause one of its Affiliates after the Closing to continue)  retiree
medical benefit plan coverage under the Company Plans set forth on _Section
6.4(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or under comparable Plans of Parent
or one of its Affiliates for a period of  one year from and following the
Closing, on the same terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior
to the Closing under the Company Plans set forth on _Section 6.4(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure  Letter. In addition, subject to _Section 6.4(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, any Continuing Employee who has satisfied as of the
Closing, or who satisfies within the one year period after the  Closing, the
eligibility requirements for participation in the Company Plans set

 


 

 


 

 

 

-61-  


 

 

forth on _Section 6.4(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, will also be
entitled to the coverage described  in the preceding sentence upon the
retirement of such Continuing Employee within the one-year period following
the Closing. Coverage of the type described in this _Section 6.4(e)_ with
respect to hourly  employees to whom such benefits are provided under a
collective bargaining agreement will be provided on the terms and conditions
provided in such collective bargaining agreement (subject to the right of
Parent or an Affiliate of Parent to  renegotiate such collective bargaining
agreement).

 


 

 

(f) _Incentive Plans_. Except as otherwise set forth on _Section 6.4(f)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, from and  after the Closing, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation will maintain the Incentive Plans through the end of the
applicable performance period, with payments pursuant to the Incentive Plans
(i) made at the time provided for in the applicable  Incentive Plan and (ii)
solely with respect to the ongoing Lord Corporation Performance Sharing
Incentive Plan, based on the actual performance of the Company and the
Surviving Corporation, considered together, during the applicable plan year.

 


 

 

(g) _Section 280G of the Code_. Subject to _Section 6.4(g)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, prior to the Closing, the  Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each individual set forth on _Section 6.4(g)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter to enter into an agreement with the Company
providing for "best net  after tax" cutback treatment (in a manner consistent
with such provisions set forth in the Company's form of Change in Control
Severance Agreement) with respect to any "excess parachute payment" as defined
in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 


 

 

(h) _Collective Bargaining/Works Council Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 6.4_ ,  Parent will comply (or cause one of
its Affiliates after the Closing to comply) with the terms of any collective
bargaining, works council or other labor agreement covering any Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

 


 

 

(i) _Employee Communications_. The Company and Parent will cooperate in
communications with Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to employee  compensation and benefit plans maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Parent and with respect to other matters arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

(j) _Acknowledgement_. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees
that nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_   will be construed to limit in
any way the ability of Parent or its Subsidiaries (which will include from and
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee from and after  the
Closing; _provided_ that such termination is in accordance with applicable
Law.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-62-  


 

 

(k) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 10.12_ , nothing in this _Section 6.4_ , express or implied, is
intended to confer any third party beneficiary or other rights, benefits,
remedies or Liabilities under this Agreement upon any Person (including any
Continuing Employees  or other current or former Employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period or continued participation in any Company
Plan, of any nature or kind whatsoever  under or by reason of this _Section
6.4_. No provision of this _Section 6.4_ is intended to and such provisions do
not modify, amend or create any employee  compensation or benefit plan of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates.

 


 

 

(l) _Cooperation_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company recognize it to
be in the best interests of the parties and their respective Employees that
the  transactions in this _Section 6.4_ be effected in an orderly manner and
agree to devote their respective reasonable best efforts and to cooperate
fully in complying with the provisions of this _Section 6.4_. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties agrees to execute,
deliver and file all documents and to take all such actions (including
providing census data with  respect to the Employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries consistent with applicable Law) as are deemed necessary or
desirable in order to carry out and perform the purpose of this _Section 6.4_
and to  facilitate the transactions referred to in this _Section 6.4_.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.5 _WARN Act; Workers Compensation_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent agrees to provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, any required
notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 and
any similar federal, state or local Law or  regulation (collectively, the "
_WARN Act_ ") and to otherwise comply with the WARN Act, in each case with
respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act)
or group termination or  similar event affecting Employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including as a result of the Merger) and occurring on
and after the Effective Time. None of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates will take any action  before or after the Closing that
would cause any termination of employment of any Employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that occurs before the Effective Time to constitute a
"plant closing" or "mass layoff" or group termination under  the WARN Act.

 


 

 

(b) The parties will reasonably cooperate in connection with any required
notification to, or any required consultation with, the Employees, employee
representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and  relevant government
agencies concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
respect to the Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-63-  


 

 

(c) From and as of the Closing, Parent will establish and maintain appropriate
workers' compensation insurance with respect to claims relating to Continuing
Employees.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.6 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective representatives
will not  contact or communicate with any person known by Parent to be an
Employee, customer or supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with, or relating in any way to, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, without the  prior written consent of the Company (which
consent may be withheld in the Company's sole discretion). In the event that
the Company provides such consent, a management Employee of the Company will
at all times accompany Parent, Merger Sub or  their respective
representative(s), as applicable, to any meeting with such Employees,
customers, suppliers or other business relations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and will participate with such Person in any such discussions,
except  to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.7 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 6.3_ , each of the
parties will use all reasonable best efforts to take,  or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and
other papers, as may be required or reasonably requested to consummate  or
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.8 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

 


 

 

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement (including _Section 2.10_
), all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party
incurring such expense; _provided_ that Parent will be responsible for the
costs and expenses incurred by the Company and its  Subsidiaries in _Sections
6.3(b)_ , _6.8(b)_ and _6.9(a)_ and will be responsible for the costs and
expenses of the  Paying Agent relating to the Paying Agent Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) All Transfer Taxes arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other transfer or documentary Taxes in connection therewith
will be borne by Parent. Parent and the  Shareholders' Representative agree
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Taxing Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Transfer Taxes. Parent and the  Shareholders'
Representative will reasonably cooperate to prepare and timely file any Tax
Returns relating to any such Transfer Taxes.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.9 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

 


 

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to (including by Parent providing sufficient funds to the
Surviving Corporation or the applicable Subsidiary  of the Surviving
Corporation), (i) indemnify and hold harmless, all past and present directors,
officers and Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in all of
their

 


 

 


 

 

 

-64-  


 

 

capacities), all fiduciaries under any Company Plans and each other Person
who, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries is or was serving as a director or officer of any other Person
(collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") against any and all costs,
expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses  and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, Proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that  such DandO Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or
Employee of any of the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries or a
fiduciary under any Company Plan or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as  a director, officer or Employee of any
other Person whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing
(including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby), and
provide advancement of expenses to the DandO Indemnified Parties (within 10 days
of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
from a DandO Indemnified Party of a request therefor), in  all such cases to
the greatest extent that such Persons are indemnified or have the right to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company and its Subsidiaries' 
certificates of incorporation, bylaws, other comparable organizational
documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement, (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest extent
permitted by  applicable Law, include and cause to be maintained in effect in
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries' (or any of their successors')
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other comparable organizational
documents for a period of six  years after the Closing, the current
provisions regarding elimination of Liability of directors, and
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, officers and
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, contained in the  certificates
of incorporation, bylaws and other comparable organizational documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (iii) not settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding or threatened Proceeding (and in 
which indemnification could be sought by a DandO Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all Liability arising out of such
Proceeding or  such DandO Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing, and
cooperates in the defense of such Proceeding or threatened Proceeding.

 


 

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide or maintain in effect for six years,
through the purchase of "run-off" coverage or  otherwise, directors' and
officers' and corporate liability insurance covering those individuals who are
covered by the directors' and officers' and corporate liability insurance
policy or policies provided for directors and officers of the Company  and
its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the " _Existing Policy_ ") on terms
comparable in all material respects to the Existing Policy and such coverage
will contain minimum aggregate limits of liability  for directors' and
officers' and corporate liability insurance coverage for

 


 

 


 

 

 

-65-  


 

 

directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the amount of
coverage at least equal to that of the Existing Policy and deductibles no 
larger than the Existing Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such "run-
off" or other coverage is not available at a cost not greater than 300% of the
annual  premiums paid as of the date hereof under the Existing Policies, then
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain as
much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such
annual premiums as do not  exceed the 300% of the annual premiums paid as of
the date hereof under the Existing Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, any
policies purchased pursuant to this _Section 6.9(b)_ will be paid for by 
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

 

(c) If Parent or, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) will
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or  legal entity and
will not be the continuing or surviving corporation or legal entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) will transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper 
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns, as the case may be, will assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 


 

 

(d) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.9_ will be
in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have under the 
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or
the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, or under any applicable
Contracts or Laws, and  Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by any of them.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.10 _Document Retention; Post-Closing Access_. From and after the
Closing, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, preserve  and keep the records held by them as of the
Closing relating to the respective businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a period of seven years from the Closing Date (or longer if
required by applicable Law or Contract) and will make such  records (or
copies) and reasonably appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times
and upon reasonable advance notice, to the Shareholders' Representative, any
Company Shareholder and any of their respective Affiliates or representatives
as  may be reasonably required by such Person in connection with any
insurance claims by, Proceedings or Tax audits against, governmental
investigations of, compliance with Law by, or the preparation of financial
statements of, the Shareholders'  Representative, any Company Shareholder or
any of their respective Affiliates or otherwise in connection with any other
matter relating to or resulting from this Agreement.

SECTION 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will promptly notify the other
of:

 


 

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger); and

 


 

 

(b) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in contained this
Agreement of such party of which it obtains knowledge that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Sections         7.1_ (in the case of either
party), _7.2_ (in the case of Parent) or _7.3_ (in the case of the Company)
not to be satisfied;

 


 

 

_provided_ that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such
notification, will affect any representation, warranty,  covenant or
obligation of any party.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.12 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
will cause each of the steps set forth on _Section 6.12_   of the Company
Disclosure Letter to be consummated at least two Business Days prior to the

respective businesses, (B) require the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
any of the Company  Representatives to pay any fees or expenses or otherwise

none of Parent's or Merger Sub's respective obligations  hereunder are
conditioned in any manner upon Parent or Merger Sub obtaining financing in

consideration to be payable or incurred by Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries following the Closing and all payments thereunder to

Parent informed on a reasonably current basis  with respect to the status

SECTION 6.20 _Financing_.

in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and any Definitive Debt 
Financing Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder; (ii) satisfy
or, if applicable, use reasonable best efforts to cause to be satisfied (or,
if deemed advisable by Parent, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions to the  funding of the Debt Financing (including the Debt
Financing Conditions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements; and (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive debt financing agreements on the terms and  subject to the
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including, if
necessary, any "flex" provisions) (the " _Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements_ "). Upon the reasonable request of the  Company, Parent will
provide the Company information in reasonable detail about the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and any other financing related to the Merger and will give the 
Company prompt notice of any fact, change, event or circumstance that is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on the Debt Financing necessary to pay the Merger Amount
contemplated by the Debt  Commitment Letter.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent will not, and will not permit Merger Sub to,
agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement or other
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt  Financing
Agreements if such termination, amendment, replacement or modification (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions or other terms or otherwise modifies any of the
conditions to the  receipt of the Debt Financing or other terms in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the Closing or (y)
make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing  materially less likely to occur,
other than, in each case, (A) a waiver of any closing conditions by lender(s)
or their agent or (B) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt  Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof or to reassign titles to such parties who had executed
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Upon any such amendment,
replacement or modification, the term " _Debt  Commitment Letter_ " and "
_Definitive Debt Financing Agreement_ " will mean the Debt Commitment Letter
or Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended, replaced
or  modified. Parent will promptly deliver to the

 


 

 


 

 

 

-70-  


 

 

Company copies of any such amendment, replacement or other modification of the
Debt Commitment Letter.

 


 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 6.20(b)_ to the contrary,
in addition to the rights of Parent set forth in _Section        
6.20(b)_ , Parent will have the right to substitute the proceeds of
consummated equity offerings or debt offerings or incurrences of debt, or
unrestricted cash or cash equivalents held by Parent, for all or any portion
of the Debt  Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter by reducing
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that (i) to the extent
any such equity or debt has a scheduled special or mandatory redemption right,
such right is not  exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation of
the Merger on the Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement and the
Termination Date and (ii) the conditions to the use of such proceeds to pay
the Merger Amounts will be no more  restrictive than the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 


 

 

(d) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary for Parent to pay
the Merger Amount becomes unavailable, then Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as  practicable, from the
same and/or alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
pay the Merger Amounts. In the event any alternative financing is  obtained
in accordance with this _Section 5.12(d)_ (" _Alternative Financing_ "),
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing will also be deemed to
refer  to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters
or definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered
into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Debt  Commitment Letters and the Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements will also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters and
definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and
all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.20_ will be applicable
thereto to the same extent as Parent's obligations with respect to the Debt
Financing.

 


 

 

SECTION 6.21 _Specified Matters_. The parties agree to the provisions set
forth in _Section 6.21_ of the Company Disclosure  Letter and will comply
with the terms thereof.

that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that

specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform
or any such breach. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and hereby  agree
that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub,  on the one hand, and each the Company, on the other

other party (as applicable), and to  specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as
applicable) under this Agreement, without proof of actual  damages or
inadequacy of legal remedy and without bond or other security being required.
The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by any party
will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue
any  other right or remedy (whether at Law or in equity) to which such party
may be entitled at any time.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-75-  


 

 

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,

remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.

 


 

 

(c) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to  prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, or Parent or Merger
Sub, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or  to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Company or Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, under this Agreement. The parties further
acknowledge and agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
_Section 9.2_ , a party will not in any respect waive its right to seek at any
time any other form or amount of relief that may be available to a party under
this Agreement (including monetary damages) and (ii)  nothing set forth in
this _Section 9.2_ will require any party to institute any Proceeding for (or
limit any party's right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 9.2_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination
right under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination
(subject to the terms of  this Agreement)), nor will the commencement of any
Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 9.2_ restrict or limit any  party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 


 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise, if
a court has determined to grant an award of damages in connection with any
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of the terms or  conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Shareholders' Representative may, on behalf of the Company
Shareholders, enforce such award and accept damages for such breach. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that any award of damages in  connection
with any breach by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub of the terms or
conditions set forth in this Agreement will not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and will, in addition to any damage to the
Company,  Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company Shareholders,
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be (taking into consideration all
relevant matters, including the  loss of the expected premium, other

act, consent or instruction of each such Company Shareholder. Each of Parent,

 


 

 

 

-77-  

 


   

Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Affiliates
and representatives are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person  for
any acts done by any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders' Representative.

 


 

 

(c) _Liability of the Shareholders ' Representative_. None of the
Shareholders' Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect
to any action or  omission by the Shareholders' Representative in connection
with the Shareholders' Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement or
any of the other Company Documents or the Parent Documents, except in the
event of liability directly  resulting from the Shareholders'
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders'
Representative will not be liable for any action or omission taken in good
faith upon the advice of counsel. The Company Shareholders will  indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Shareholders' Representative from and against any
and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and  experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising
out of or in connection with the Shareholders' Representative's  execution
and performance of this Agreement and any of the other Company Documents or
the Parent Documents, in each case, as such Representative Loss is suffered or
incurred; _provided_ that in the event  that any such Representative Loss is
finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Shareholders' Representative, the Shareholders'
Representative will reimburse the Company Shareholders the  amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Any such Representative Losses will first be
recovered by the Shareholders' Representative from the funds in the 
Shareholders' Representative's Expense Funds; _provided_ that while this
_Section 10.2(c)_ allows the Shareholders' Representative to be paid from
the  aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company
Shareholders from its obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Shareholders'
Representative from seeking any  remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In no event will the Shareholders' Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Shareholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any  restrictions or
limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company
Shareholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be 
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholders' Representative
under this _Section 10.2(c)_. The foregoing indemnities will survive Closing,
the resignation or removal of the Shareholders'  Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(d) The Shareholders' Representative's Expense Funds will be used for the
purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Shareholders'

 


 

 


 

 

 

-78-  


 

 


 

 

Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement the
other Company Documents or the Parent Documents. The Company Shareholders 
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Shareholders'
Representative's Expense Funds and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Shareholders' Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or  earnings. The Shareholders' Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Shareholders' Representative's
Expense Funds other than as a result of its bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Shareholders'  Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to its creditors in the event of  bankruptcy. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the Shareholders' Representative's
responsibilities, the Shareholders' Representative will deliver any remaining
balance of the Shareholders' Representative's Expense Funds to the  Paying
Agent for disbursement to the Company Shareholders. For tax purposes, the
Shareholders' Representative's Expense Funds will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by Company Shareholders at the time of
Closing.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.3 _Materiality; Company Disclosure Letter_. As used in this
Agreement, unless the context would require otherwise, the term "material" and
the concept of the  "material" nature of an effect upon the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries will be measured relative to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is currently being conducted. There  have been included in the
Company Disclosure Letter and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement
items which are not "material" within the meaning of the immediately preceding
sentence for informational purposes and in order to avoid any 
misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
will not be deemed to be an agreement by the Company or Parent that such items
are "material" or to further define the meaning of such term for purposes of
this Agreement.   With respect to the Company Disclosure Letter, any
disclosures made on the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to any
representation or warranty will be deemed to be made with respect to any other
representation or warranty to which such  disclosure's relevance is
reasonably apparent based on such disclosure. Nothing contained in the Company
Disclosure Letter should be construed as an admission of liability or
responsibility of any party to any third party in connection with any 
pending or threatened Proceeding or otherwise. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, in no event will the listing or
disclosure of any information or document in the Company Disclosure Letter or
in the documents  referred to or incorporated by reference in the Company
Disclosure Letter constitute or be deemed to imply any representation,
warranty, undertaking, covenant or other obligation of the Company not
expressly set out in this Agreement or will such  disclosure be construed as
extending the scope of any representation or warranty, undertaking, covenant
or obligation set out in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.4 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified
or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by the  Company and Parent. Any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement, which may be lawfully waived, may be waived in writing at any time
by each party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of
the provisions of this  Agreement by a party will be binding only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such party. No
failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will be deemed to or will
constitute a waiver of such provision and no  waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor will such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the  provisions set
forth in this _Section 10.4_ and _Sections 2.10(d)_ , _3.1(e)_ , _10.2_   and
_10.9(c)_ and the definition of the "Shareholders' Representative's Expense
Funds," to the extent such provisions affect the rights and obligations of the
Shareholders' Representative, in each case,  may not be amended, supplemented
or waived in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to the
Shareholders' Representative without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders' Representative and (b) the provisions set forth in this _Section
10.4_ and _Sections 10.1(b)_ , _10.12_ , _10.13_ , _10.14_ and _10.21_ , to
the extent such provisions affect the rights and obligations of the Debt
Financing Parties, in each case may not be amended, supplemented or  waived
in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to any Debt Financing
Party without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Party.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.5 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder will not be assignable or transferable (including by operation of
Law or otherwise) (a)  by Parent or Merger Sub without the prior written
consent of the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or Shareholders'
Representative (from and after the Effective Time) and (b) by the Company
(prior to the Effective Time) or the Shareholders'  Representative (from and
after the Effective Time) without the prior written consent of Parent.

IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN
ANY COURT RELATING  TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF,

OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN  CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT

Parent under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or

SECTION 10.16 _Legal Representation_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees
that, as to all communications between and among legal counsel (including
Jones Day) for the  Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by or in
connection with this Agreement (including the Merger) (collectively, the "
_Privileged  Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence with respect to the Privileged Communications
belongs to the Company Shareholders and may be controlled by such Company
Shareholders (via the  Shareholders' Representative) and will not pass to or
be claimed by Parent or any of its respective Affiliates (including, following
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries). The Privileged
Communications are the property of  the Company Shareholders and, from and
after the Closing, none of Parent, its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through Parent or such  Subsidiaries will
seek to obtain the Privileged Communications, whether by seeking a waiver of
the attorney-client privilege or through other means. Parent and

 


 

 


 

 

 

-84-  


 

 

its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
and the Subsidiaries), together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or  assigns, further agree that no such Person may use or rely on
any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving the
Shareholders' Representative or any of the Company Shareholders or any of
their respective Affiliates after  the Closing. The Privileged Communications
may be used by the Shareholders' Representative, the Company Shareholders or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates
to the transactions contemplated by or in  connection with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and a third  party
(other than a party to this Agreement or any of its Affiliates) after the
Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to  prevent disclosure of confidential communications by counsel to
such third party, _provided_ that neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its 
Subsidiaries) may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the Shareholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Shareholders. If the
Company Shareholders or the Shareholders' Representative so desire, and
without the need for  any written consent or waiver by Parent, Merger Sub, or
the Surviving Corporation, Jones Day is permitted to represent any of the
Company Shareholders and/or the Shareholders' Representative after the Closing
in connection with any matter related  to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.17 _Non-Recourse_. Except as set forth in the Confidentiality

whatsoever (whether at  Law or in equity, whether sounding in Contract, tort,
statute or otherwise) may be asserted by Parent, any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) or any Person claiming by, through or  for the benefit of any
of them, and Parent, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries) and any
Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of any of them covenants 
never to assert or voluntarily assist any Person in asserting any such claim,
against any Person who is not party to this Agreement (and with respect to the
Shareholders' Representative, only to the extent of its duties hereunder),
including any  direct or indirect past, current or future equityholders,
partners, partnerships, limited liability companies, joint ventures, members,
controlling Persons, directors, officers, Employees, incorporators, managers,
agents, representatives or  Affiliates of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective estates, heirs, executors,
administrators, successors or assigns (each a " _Non-Party_ ") with respect to
any matters directly  or indirectly arising under or relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including with respect to the operation of their
respective businesses prior to the Closing or any other transaction,
circumstance or state of facts involving the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing), this Agreement or its negotiation,
performance or subject matter or the transactions contemplated hereby or with
respect to any actual or alleged inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions 
with respect to

 


 

 


 

 

 

-85-  


 

 

information or documents provided or otherwise furnished to any Person by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Non-Party
concerning the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries (including with respect to
the operation of their respective businesses prior to the Closing or any other
transaction, circumstance or state of facts involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing),  this Agreement or its negotiation,
performance or subject matter or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.18 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation), on its own
behalf and on behalf of  each of its respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns (each a " _Releasing Person_ "), hereby fully and unconditionally
releases, acquits and forever discharges the current and former managers,
members,  partners, officers and directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in such capacities, the Company Shareholders in such capacities
and each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns and each other
Non-Party (each a " _Released Person_ ") from all debts, demands, causes of
action, suits, covenants, torts, damages and any and all claims, defenses,
offsets, judgments, demands and liabilities whatsoever, of every name and 
nature, whether in Law (including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, §§ 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq. and other
Environmental Laws) or in equity, whether in  Contract or in tort or
otherwise, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued, which have been or could
have been asserted against any Released Person, which any Releasing Person has
or ever had, which arises out of or in any way relates to events, 
circumstances or actions occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the
Closing Date in respect of matters relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each a " _Released Claim_ "), except for Fraud.   Each of
Parent, the Company and Merger Sub covenants and agrees (i) that it will not,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates not
to, take any action inconsistent with this _Section  10.18_ (including
commencing any litigation with respect to, or, directly or indirectly,
transferring to another Person, any Released Claim) and (ii) to indemnify and
hold harmless each Released Person from and against and in respect  of any
and all losses incurred by any such Released Person as a result of any such
action by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation that is inconsistent
with this _Section 10.18_. This _Section 10.18_ will survive the Closing, is
intended for the benefit of and may be enforced directly by each of the
Released Persons, and will be binding on all successors and permitted assigns
of the Company  and the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.19 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform all of their
respective agreements,  covenants and obligations under this Agreement on a
timely basis. Parent unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company
and, to the extent set forth in _Section 10.12_ , the other Persons who  are
entitled to the benefit of this Agreement, the full and complete performance
by each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation of its respective
obligations under this Agreement and will be liable for any breach of any
representation,  warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation under this Agreement. Parent hereby waives diligence,
presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require
any

 


 

 


 

 

 

-86-   
   

Proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation any protest,
any notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of
its obligations  set forth in this _Section 10.19_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.20 _Construction; Cooperation_. The parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or
question of intent or  interpretation arises, this Agreement will be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party because of the authorship
of any provision of this Agreement. Any  language from prior drafts of this
Agreement, to the extent not included in the definitive version of this
Agreement executed by the parties, will not be deemed to reflect the intention
of any party, or otherwise serve as parole evidence of any  kind, with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

SECTION 10.21 _Lender Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company, the Shareholders' Representative
and their  respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members and shareholders will not have any rights or
claims against any Debt Financing Party, in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or in respect  of any document or transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,  and
(b) no Debt Financing Party will have any liability (whether in contract, in
tort or otherwise) to the Company, the Shareholders' Representative or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers,  members, representatives and shareholders for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect any oral or written representations made or alleged to have
been made in connection  herewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise; _provided_ that, notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above,
the foregoing will not apply to or otherwise be binding upon Parent,  Merger
Sub and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members and shareholders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Debt Financing Parties are
intended  third-party beneficiaries of, and will be entitled to the
protections of, this provision.
