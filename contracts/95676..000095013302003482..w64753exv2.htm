Agreement to the contrary, shares (the &#147;Appraisal Shares&#148;) of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (&#147;Section
262&#148;) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section&nbsp;2.01(c), but instead such holder
shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;262. At the Effective Time,
all Appraisal Shares shall be automatically canceled, shall cease to
exist and shall no longer be outstanding, and each holder of Appraisal
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section&nbsp;262, or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section&nbsp;262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holder&#146;s Appraisal Shares under Section&nbsp;262 shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section&nbsp;2.01(c). The Company shall
serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.</FONT></TD>

Services, LLC or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the

Merger Consideration. From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall

Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate (i)&nbsp;a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may specify and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall,
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;II.

any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this

cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to
receipt of the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
