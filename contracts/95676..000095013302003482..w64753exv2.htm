     | AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of
October 19, 2002, among KING PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Tennessee
corporation ("Parent"), MERLIN 2002 ACQUISITION CORP., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and
MERIDIAN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").  
  

 WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company ("Company Voting Common Stock") and each issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company ("Company Nonvoting Common Stock", and, together with the Company Voting Common Stock, "Company Common Stock"), other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the Company and (ii) the Appraisal Shares, will be converted into the right to receive $44.50 in cash; and   

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I  

 _The Merger_   

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall  ##### 

  

 succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on the first business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".   

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").   

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.   

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate") shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so amended, such Company Certificate shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   

 (b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the direc-  ##### 

  

tors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.   

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.   

ARTICLE II  

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent 
 Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_  

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:       |   
---|--- 
     | (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding
share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  
     
     | (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._
 Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the
Company, Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  
     
     | (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.01(b) and the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive $44.50 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.  ##### 

         |   
---|--- 
     | (d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such
holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective
Time, all Appraisal Shares shall be automatically canceled, shall cease
to exist and shall no longer be outstanding, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262
shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of
the foregoing.  
  

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ As of the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Mellon Investor Services, LLC or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration as and when required to be paid pursuant to this  ##### 

  

Agreement(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may specify and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business  ##### 

  

on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery
of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.   

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.   

 (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receipt of the Merger Consideration as provided herein.   

 (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such  ##### 

  

Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
thereto.   

 (h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.   

ARTICLE III  

 _Representations and Warranties_   

 SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._  Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:        |   
---|--- 
     | (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is incorporated and has all requisite corporate power and
authority and possesses all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations
and approvals necessary to enable it to use its corporate name and to
own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets
and to carry on its business as presently conducted and as currently
proposed by its management to be conducted, except where the failure to
possess such governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals individually or in the aggregate has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
the ownership, leasing or operation  ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed individually or in the aggregate has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
delivered to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement true, complete
and correct copies of the Company Certificate and its By-laws (the "Company
By-laws"), and the comparable organizational documents of each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date hereof. The Company has
made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the minutes
(or, in the case of minutes that have not yet been finalized, drafts thereof)
of all meetings of the stockholders of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and the committees of each of such Board of Directors, in each
case held since January 1, 1999.  
     
     | (b) _Subsidiaries._ (i) Section 3.01(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists each of the Subsidiaries of the Company and,
for each such Subsidiary, the state of incorporation and each jurisdiction
in which such Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business. All
the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company
free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances
or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens"), and free of any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity
interests. Except for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity
interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or equity
interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or
other entity.  
       |   
---|--- 
     | (ii) The information set forth on Section 3.01(b)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter is true and correct in all material respects.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, whether
direct or derivative, to any of the stockholders of MTEC, Inc. with respect
to actions taken or events that have occurred prior to the date of this
Agreement, including by virtue of any liability that the   ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than MTEC, Inc.) may
have to MTEC, Inc., except, in the case of MTEC, Inc., any liability owed to
such stockholders representing a claim to such stockholders proportionate
share of the current net assets of MTEC, Inc.  
       |   
---|--- 
     | (c) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of 17,800,000 shares of Company Voting Common
Stock, 200,000 shares of Company Nonvoting Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company Preferred Stock"). At
the close of business on October 18, 2002, (i) 4,514,145 shares of Company
Voting Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) 30,176 shares of
Company Voting Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury, (iii)
1,392,747 shares of Company Voting Common Stock were reserved and available
for issuance pursuant to the 1986 Stock Option Plan of the Company, as
amended, the Brunswick Biomedical Corporation 1993 Stock Option Plan, the
1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan of the Company, as amended, the 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan of the Company, as amended, and the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan of the Company (such plans, collectively, the "Company Stock Plans") (of
which 1,246,059 shares of Company Voting Common Stock were subject to
outstanding Company Stock Options), (iv) no shares of Company Nonvoting
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding or were
held by the Company as treasury shares and (v) warrants to acquire 127,262
shares of Company Common Stock from the Company pursuant to the warrant
agreements identified on Schedule 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and previously delivered in complete and correct form to Parent
(the "Warrants") were issued and outstanding. Except as set forth above
in this Section 3.01(c), at the close of business on October 18, 2002,
no shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity interests
of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire or
receive any such stock, securities or interests were issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding stock
appreciation rights, "phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights to
receive shares of Company Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights
(other than Company Stock Options and Warrants) that are linked to the value
of Company Common Stock (collectively, "Company Stock-Based
Awards"). Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true, complete and correct list, at the close of business on October 18,
2002, of all outstanding  ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively,
"Company Stock Options") and all outstanding Company Stock-Based Awards
granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (other than rights under
the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP")), and all outstanding
Warrants, the number of shares of Company Common Stock (or other stock)
subject thereto, the grant dates, expiration dates, exercise or base prices
(if applicable) and vesting schedules thereof and the names of the holders
thereof. All (i) outstanding Company Stock Options (other than rights under
the ESPP) and (ii) other outstanding Company Stock-Based Awards are evidenced
by stock option agreements or other award agreements, in each case in the
forms set forth in Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and
no stock option agreement or other award agreement contains terms that
are inconsistent wit h such forms. The Company does not have any rights
to repurchase at a fixed purchase price outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock and no Company Stock Options or other outstanding
Company Stock-Based Awards are evidenced by restricted stock purchase
agreements. Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise
price of each other Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market
value of a share of Company Common Stock as determined on the date of grant
of such Company Stock Option. At the close of business on October 18,
2002, there were outstanding Company Stock Options (other than rights under
the ESPP) to purchase 1,246,059 shares of Company Common Stock with
exercise prices on a per share basis lower than the Merger Consideration, and
the weighted average exercise price of such Company Stock Options was

     | Documents"). As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and none of the SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained
in any SEC Document has been revised or superseded by an SEC Document
filed by the Company and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (a "Filed SEC Document"), none of the SEC Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact

periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end audit adjustments). Except as set forth in the most recent
financial statements included in the Filed SEC Documents, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liabilities of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) other
than liabilities arising after the date of the balance sheet included in
such financial statements which were incurred in the ordinary course
of business of the Company consistent with past practice. None of
the Subsidiaries of the Company are, or have at any time since January
1, 1999 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a)
and 15(d) of the Exchange Act or similar foreign Legal Provisions.  #####

is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that
no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub in writing specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(sometimes referred to herein as a "Company Pension Plan"), each Company
Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans. The Company has
made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (A) each
Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plans,
descriptions thereof), (B) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500
required to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (C)
the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for
which such summary plan description is required and (D) each trust agreement
and insurance or group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan,
if any. Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. The Company, its Subsidiaries and all
the Company Benefit Plans are all in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable laws relating to the Company Benefit Plans, including laws of
foreign jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and
the European Union) relating to the Company Benefit Plans, and the terms
of all collective bargaining agreements.  
     
     | (ii) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified
(other than any Company Multiemployer Pension Plan) have received
favorable determination letters from the IRS with respect to "TRA" (as
defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39), and have timely filed with the
IRS determination letter applications with respect to "GUST" (as defined
in Section 1 of Notice 2001-42), to the effect that such Company
Pension Plans are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such
determination letter has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
has revocation been threatened) and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination
letter or application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan
that would materially adversely affect the qualification of such
Company Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or
require security under Section 307 of ERISA. All Company Pension Plans
required by applicable law to have been approved by any foreign
Governmental Entity, including any Governmental   ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | Entity of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland or the European
Union, have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked (or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened) and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the most
recent approval or application therefor relating to any such Company Pension
Plan that would materially affect any such approval relating thereto or
materially increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has made
available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the most recent
determination letter received with respect to each Company Pension Plan, if
any, as well as a true, complete and correct copy of each pending application
for a determination letter, if any. The Company has also made available
to Parent a true, complete and correct list of all amendments to any
Company Pension Plan as to which a favorable determination letter has not
yet been received.  
     
     | (iii) No Company Pension Plan, other than any Company Pension
Plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Company Multiemployer Pension Plan") is subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA. No liability
under Title IV of ERISA which has not been satisfied in full has been or
is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) or
Company Multiemployer Pension Plan, in each case currently or formerly
maintained or contributed to (or required to be maintained or contributed to)
by any of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Commonly Controlled Entity.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred a "complete
withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections
4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date of such
Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect to any Company Multiemployer Pension
Plan.  
     
     | (iv) Except as would not give rise to any material liability,
all material reports, returns and similar documents with respect to
all Company Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental
Entity or distributed to any Company Benefit Plan participant have been duly
and timely filed or distributed. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has received written notice of, and to the Knowledge of
the Company, there are no investigations by any Governmental Entity   ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | with respect to, termination proceedings or other claims (except
claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit
Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Company Benefit Plan
or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material
liability, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts that
could give rise to any material liability in the event of any
such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.  
     
     | (v) Except as would not give rise to any material liability,
all contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of
the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit
Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the most
recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference into
the Filed SEC Documents.  
     
     | (vi) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (A) there has
not occurred any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of
such Company Benefit Plan, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any agent
of the foregoing, has engaged that could subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, or a
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created under any
Company Benefit Plan, to a material tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or sanction imposed under
Title I of ERISA and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other
fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing,
has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in
any manner, that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary, to any liability for breach
of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any material liability for breach
of fiduciary duty under any other applicable law. No Company Benefit Plan or
related trust has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event"
(as that term is defined in Section   ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not
been waived with respect to any Company Benefit Plan during the last five
years.  
     
     | (vii) Section 3.01(m)(vii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter discloses whether each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan is (A) unfunded or self-insured, (B) funded through
a "welfare benefit fund", as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of
the Code, or other funding mechanism or (C) insured. Each such
employee welfare benefit plan may be amended or terminated (including with
respect to benefits provided to retirees and other former employees)
without material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any
time after the Effective Time. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries complies in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state statute
with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as
such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such state statute.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material obligations
for retiree health, dental or life insurance benefits under any
Company Benefit Plan (other than (i) for continuation coverage required
under Section 4980(f) of the Code, (ii) death or retirement benefits under
any Company Pension Plan or (iii) benefits, the full cost of which,
including any cost to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is payable by
current or former employees or directors (or their beneficiaries)).  
     
     | (viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as
a result of any termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
or termination pay, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise)
of, compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any breach or violation of,
or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.  
     
     | (ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any material liability or obligations,   ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | including under or on account of a Company Benefit Plan, arising
out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or independent
contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  
     
     | (x) No deduction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in respect of any "applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning
of Section 162(m) of the Code) has been disallowed or is subject
to disallowance by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.  
     
     | (n) _No Excess Parachute Payments._ Other than payments
or benefits that may be made to the persons listed in Section 3.01(n) of
the Company Disclosure Letter ("Primary Company Executives"), no amount
or other entitlement or economic benefit that could be received (whether
in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the
Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for the
benefit of any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or
any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term
is defined in the 1989 proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
under any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise would
be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no disqualified individual
is entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any other person in the
event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed
on such disqualified individual (a "Parachute Gross Up Payment").
Section 3.01(n) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, calculated as of
the date of this Agreement, (i) a good faith estimate of the "base
amount" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for
each Primary Company Executive and each other disqualified individual
(defined as set forth above) whose Company Stock Options will vest pursuant
to their terms in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, the consummation
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (including as a result of any termination of employment on or
following the   ##### 

       |   
---|--- 
     | Effective Time) and (ii) the estimated maximum amount that could
be paid or provided to each Primary Company Executive as a result of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time).  
     
     | (o) _Taxes._ (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and each Company Consolidated Group has filed or has caused to be filed
all material tax returns required to be filed by it, and all such returns
are complete and accurate in all material respects. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and each Company Consolidated Group has paid or
caused to be paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf) all material taxes
due and owing, and the most recent financial statements contained in
the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any
reserves for deferred taxes) for all material taxes payable by the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof accrued
through the date of such financial statements.  
     
     | (ii) No deficiencies, audit examinations, refund
litigation, proposed adjustments or matters in controversy for any taxes have
been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Company Consolidated Group which have not
been settled and paid. All assessments for taxes due and owing by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Consolidated Group with
respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded litigation have
been paid. There is no currently effective agreement or other document
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries extending, or
having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of
any taxes.  
     
     | (iii) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will
be required to include in a taxable period ending after the Effective
Time taxable income attributable to income that accrued in a prior
taxable period but was not recognized for tax purposes in any prior
taxable period as a result of the installment method of accounting, the
completed contract method of accounting, the long-term contract method
of accounting, the cash method of accounting or Section 481 of the Code
or comparable provisions of United States Federal, state, local or
United Kingdom,   #####

or (B) which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series
of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) in conjunction with the Merger.  
     
     | (v) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules

3402 of the Code and similar provisions under any United States Federal,
state or local or United Kingdom, Northern Ireland or other European Union
or other non-United States tax laws) and have, within the time and
the manner prescribed by law, withheld from and paid over to the
proper Governmental Entities all material taxes required to be so withheld
and paid over under applicable laws.  
     
     | (vi) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was, at
any time during a period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code,

     | (vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) is a
party to any tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement other than
an agreement exclusively among the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (B)

     | (p) _Title to Properties._ (i) Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or valid
leasehold interests in, all its real property and personal property except
for such as are no longer used or useful in the conduct of its business or as

similar encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate have not
materially interfered with, and could not reasonably be expected to
materially interfere with, its ability to conduct its business as
presently conducted and as currently proposed by its management to be
conducted. All such real property and personal property, other than real
property and personal property in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, are free and clear of all Liens,

     | (ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each third party has complied in all material
respects with the terms of all leases to which the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries is a party and under which it is in occupancy, and all
such leases are in full force and effect. Each of the Company and

     | Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received a written notice
from any third party of a fact that could reasonably be expected to be
materially detrimental to the continued enjoyment by the Company or any of

disputes, charges, conflicts, actions, allegations or challenges that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing or violating or has
infringed or violated or will infringe or violate (including with respect to
the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, importation or exportation by

 (c) _Advice of Changes; Filings._ The Company and Parent shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing of (i) any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Sub) contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality being or becoming as of any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Date untrue or inaccurate at such time in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified being or becoming as of any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Date untrue or inaccurate at such time in any material respect or (ii) the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall promptly provide the other copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the portions of such filings that include confidential information not directly related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Closing Date so that after such date neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.   

 The Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing a certificate from the Company, dated no more than 30 days prior to the Closing Date and signed by a responsible corporate officer of the Company under penalties of perjury, to the effect that, to such responsible corporate officers knowledge and belief, the Company has not been at any time in the previous five years a "United States real property holding corporation", as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code.   

 SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 4.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and request  ##### 

  

the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and Gerard Klauer Mattison and Co. or another
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover
Proposal was unsolicited and made after the date hereof and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may, if its Board
of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and Gerard Klauer Mattison and Co. or another financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Legal Provisions, and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c)
and after giving Parent written notice of such determination, (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement, _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.   

 The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the shareholders of any person would own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any resulting parent company of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  ##### 

   

 The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third party that if consummated would result in such person (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and Gerard Klauer Mattison and Co. or another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) (i) would result in greater value to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)); _provided_ , however, that the Company shall not be prohibited from entering into an agreement referred to in and in accordance with Section 7.01(f)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply  ##### 

  

with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Legal Provisions.   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully informed on a current basis of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal.   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) communicating information about any Takeover Proposal to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Legal Provisions.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof of such Board of Directors or such committees approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall afford to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access (including for the purpose of coordinating integration activities and transition planning with the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report,  ##### 

  

schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Except for
disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality letter
agreement dated as of August 28, 2002, between Parent and the Company (as it
may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent
shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information
received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party
hereto pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or
warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the
conditions hereunder to the obligations of the parties hereto.   

 SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall (1) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or  ##### 

  

any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any
state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to
agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of
any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.   

 SECTION 5.04. _Company Stock Options; Warrants._ (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following:        |

     | (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options
(other than rights under the ESPP) as necessary to provide that, at
the Effective Time, each such Company Stock Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
be canceled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive,
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, a single lump sum
cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (2) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of such Company Stock Option;  
     
     | (ii) terminate the ESPP (and any then outstanding offering
period thereunder) at the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP as in effect on the date hereof and refund without interest to
each participant (or such participants beneficiary) as soon as
practicable thereafter the entire amount, if any, in each participants
account thereunder; and  
     
     | (iii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as
the Company and Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to
the Merger.  
  

 (b) All amounts payable to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 5.04(a)(i) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest as soon as practicable following the  ##### 

  

Effective Time.   

 (c) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option (or former holder of a Company Stock Option) or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).   

 SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws or any indemnification agreement between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors; or (ii) this Agreement and Plan of Merger, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Legal Provisions), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the  ##### 

  

event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them and to Parent. Parents obligations under this Section 5.05(b) continue
in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim
(a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Claim.   

 (c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05.   

 (d) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a true, complete and correct copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable in any material respect than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such directors and officers; _provided further_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.05(d) Parent shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (which premiums for coverage for such last full fiscal year are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be $89,500), it being understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such annual 200% amount.   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or  ##### 

  

otherwise.   

 SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.   

 (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (iii) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal,(B) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if a vote to obtain the Stockholder Approval or the Stockholders Meeting has not been held) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal (solely for purposes of Section 5.06(b)(iii), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to "20%" shall be deemed references to "50%"), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $7,400,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) or (ii) above, on the date of termination of this Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment required by clause (iii) above, on the date of the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (iii)(C).   

 (c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.    ##### 

   

 SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Legal Provisions, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.   

 SECTION 5.08. _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.   

 SECTION 5.09. _Employee Matters._ (a) Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, for the six-month period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Affected Employees") who continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the Company Benefit Plans (other than the Company Stock Plans and any other plans to the extent they provide for the issuance of Company Common Stock or benefits based on the value of Company Common Stock) without any benefit reduction or elimination. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any of their subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of shares of capital stock, warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements.   

 (b) Subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, commencing upon the expiration of the six-month period referred to in Section 5.09(a), with respect to any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), severance or vacation plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and made available to Affected Employees ("Parents Plans"), service with the Company or  ##### 

  

any of its Subsidiaries shall be treated for all purposes (other than for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan and other
than as would result in the duplication of benefits) as service with Parent
and its Subsidiaries (solely to the extent such service was recognized for
such purposes under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan, if any such
corresponding Company Benefit Plan exists immediately prior to the Effective
Time). Any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions
and requirements to show evidence of good health contained in any of Parents
Plans that provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits shall not apply

Affected Employee would have been granted or accrued for such calendar year
had the Affected Employee been covered under Parents vacation plan or policy
for the entirety of such calendar year.
