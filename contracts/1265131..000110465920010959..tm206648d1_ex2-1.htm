actual or deemed sale of the stock of the Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiaries in
the Carrier Entities Transaction, Buyer shall pay over the Tax Amount to
Seller no later than five (5) business days after the due date for filing IRS
Form 8023.

  



  

(ii) _Closing Financial Statements and Post-Closing
Adjustment Notice_. As promptly as practicable, but no later than 75 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver, or shall cause to be
prepared and delivered, to Seller (A) a balance sheet of NLC, prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with the accounting
principles, practices, procedures, methodologies and policies that were
employed in preparing the NLC Financial Statements (with consistent
classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and
estimation methodologies) (the " _NLC Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as of the
Closing Date except that the NLC Closing Balance Sheet shall not give effect
to the transactions described in Section 2(a), and (B) a statement (the "
_Post-Closing Adjustment Notice_ ") setting forth (1) the Tangible Book
Value of NLC on the NLC Closing Balance Sheet, as calculated as set forth on
Section 2(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _NLC Closing Tangible
Book Value_ ") and the amount by which the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value is
greater than or less than the NLC Pre-Closing Tangible Book Value and (2) any
disagreement with (or adjustment to) Seller's calculation of the Tax Amount.
Buyer agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the NLC Closing
Tangible Book Value is finally determined in accordance with this Section
2(c), it will not take any actions with respect to any accounting
books, records, policies or procedures on which the NLC Pre-Closing Balance
Sheet is based, or on which the NLC Closing Balance Sheet is to be based,
that are inconsistent with the ordinary course past practice of the Business
(or of Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Business) prior to
the Closing or that would impede or delay the final determination of the NLC
Closing Tangible Book Value. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no changes shall be made (including any changes reflected in
the NLC Closing Balance Sheet) in any reserve or other account existing as of
the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the NLC Financial
Statements or other amount reflected in such balance sheet, except as a result
of events occurring after such date and prior to the Closing and, in such
event, only in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Business
using the same accounting principles, practices, policies, procedures and
methodologies (with consistent classifications, judgments,
inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and
applied in the preparation of the NLC Financial Statements.

(iii) _Review of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Notice_. Seller shall have 30 days from the date on which the NLC Closing
Balance Sheet and the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice are delivered to review
such documents (the " _Review Period_ "). Seller and its accountant shall be
provided with reasonable access to the related work papers of Buyer in
connection with such review. If Seller disagrees in any respect with any item
or amount shown or reflected in the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice, Seller
may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to
Buyer setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item or amount and
the basis for Seller's disagreement therewith, together with reasonably
detailed supporting calculations (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Dispute
Notice shall set forth Seller's good faith position as to the amount of the
NLC Closing Tangible Book Value and the Tax Amount, in each case, if disputed.
If no Dispute Notice is received by Buyer on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, the NLC Closing Balance Sheet and the Post-Closing Adjustment
Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller.

  



  

(iv) _Consultation Period_. During the 30 days
immediately following Buyer's receipt of a Dispute Notice (the "
_Consultation Period_ "), Seller and Buyer will use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Dispute Notice.

  



  

(v) _The Accountant_. After the end of the
Consultation Period, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain KPMG LLP (or
another accounting firm of national reputation mutually agreed upon by Buyer
and Seller) to resolve such of the issues set forth in the Dispute Notice as
shall not have been resolved by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller
prior to such date. If for any reason KPMG LLP (or such other mutually agreed
upon firm) shall not be available to resolve such issues consistent with this
Section 2(c), Buyer and Seller shall promptly retain the services of a
national or regional independent accounting firm with experience in
preparing GAAP financial statements for holding companies with Texas domestic
property/casualty insurance companies, which does not at the time of
retention provide, and has not in the prior three years provided, services to
Buyer or Seller (or to their Affiliates). If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on
the independent accounting firm to be retained within 30 days, Buyer and
Seller shall each submit the name of one accounting firm that satisfies the
qualifications set forth in this Section 2(c)(v), and the
independent accounting firm shall be selected by lot from those two firms.
The independent accounting firm retained by Buyer and Seller pursuant to this
Section 2(c)(v) (the " _Accountant_ ") shall conduct such review of the NLC
Closing Balance Sheet, the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice and the Dispute
Notice, any supporting documentation and any related work papers as the
Accountant in its sole discretion deems necessary to resolve the issues
raised in the Dispute Notice, and the Accountant shall conduct such hearings
or hear or review such oral or written presentations by the Parties as the
Accountant in its sole discretion deems necessary to resolve such issues.

  



  

(vi) _The Accountant 's Report_. The Accountant
shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than 30 days
following the date of its retention, deliver to Seller and Buyer a written
report (the " _Accountant 's Report_"), in which the Accountant shall, after
considering all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice (other than those
resolved by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller), determine the
amount of the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value and the Tax Amount, in
each case, if disputed. The Accountant's Report shall set forth, in
reasonable detail, the Accountant's determination with respect to each of the
disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice (other than those
resolved by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller), and the revisions,
if any, to be made to the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice, the amount of
the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value and the Tax Amount, together with
supporting calculations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if the NLC
Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount identified by Buyer in the Post-
Closing Adjustment Notice is higher than the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value
or the Tax Amount identified by Seller in the Dispute Notice, then the
Accountant shall not, and shall have no authority to, determine that the NLC
Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount, as applicable, is greater than
the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount, as applicable,
identified by Buyer in the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice, or less than the
NLC Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount, as applicable, identified
by Seller in the Dispute Notice (in each case as adjusted by any issues
resolved by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller after delivery of the
Dispute Notice and prior to engagement of the Accountant) and (b) if the NLC
Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount identified by Buyer in the
Post-Closing Adjustment Notice is less than the NLC Closing Tangible Book
Value or the Tax Amount identified by Seller in the Dispute Notice, then the
Accountant shall not, and shall have no authority to, determine that the NLC
Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount, as applicable, is greater than
the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount, as
applicable, identified by Seller in the Dispute Notice, or less than the NLC
Closing Tangible Book Value or the Tax Amount, as applicable, identified by
Buyer in the Post-Closing Adjustment Notice (in each case as adjusted by any
issues resolved by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller after delivery of the
Dispute Notice and prior to engagement of the Accountant). The fees and
expenses of the Accountant incurred in connection with the matters referred
to in this Section 2(c)(vi) shall be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by
Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually
contested but not awarded to Seller or Buyer, respectively, bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by Seller and Buyer. The
Accountant's Report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and
shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is enforceable pursuant to the
terms of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.

Notice (if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered) by agreement of the Parties,
or (iii) the issuance of the Accountant's Report (if a timely Dispute Notice
is delivered and the Parties do not resolve all matters by agreement prior to
issuance of the Accountant's Report), as the case may be, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the excess of the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value
and the Tax Amount (as finally determined) over the NLC Pre-Closing Tangible
Book Value and the Tax Amount or Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the excess of the NLC Pre-Closing Tangible Book Value and the Tax Amount over
the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value and the Tax Amount (as finally
determined), in either case plus interest at an annual rate of 5.0% on
the amount of such payment from and including the Closing Date to, but

shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West
52nd Street, New York, New York 10019 commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time on
the last business day of the calendar month in which all conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transaction (other than
conditions with respect to actions the respective Parties will take at the
Closing itself) are satisfied or waived by the appropriate party, or such
other appropriate date as the Parties may mutually determine (the "
_Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of 11:59

(f) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, each Party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration otherwise payable under the terms of this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold pursuant to any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld and
timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. In the event that any Party determines
that withholding from any payment contemplated hereunder is required under
applicable Tax Law and permitted under this Agreement such Party will use
reasonable efforts to notify the applicable recipient at least five business
days prior to the Closing Date that the applicable payment is to be made so as
to provide such recipient with an opportunity to provide any form or
documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding.

reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied by Buyer on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be
available to Buyer on the date of the Closing. Buyer has paid in full any and
all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms

(cc) _Systems_.  The computer, information technology and data
processing systems used by NLC or its Subsidiaries, including all software,
hardware, networks, communications facilities, platforms and related systems
and services (collectively, the " _Systems_ "), are reasonably sufficient to
permit NLC or its Subsidiaries to conduct the Business as currently conducted.
All Systems, other than software that is duly and validly licensed to NLC or
its Subsidiaries, are owned and operated by and are under the control of
Seller, NLC or such Subsidiaries, and are not wholly or partly dependent on

Section 5. _Pre-Closing Covenants_. On or before the Closing,
each of the Parties shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, do the
following:

  



  

(a) _General_.  Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Law to
consummate and make effective in the most expeditious manner possible the
Transaction and, as applicable, the Carrier Entities Transaction, including
(i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices
required to be filed to consummate the Transaction and, as applicable, the
Carrier Entities Transaction, as soon as practicable, (ii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transaction and, as applicable, the Carrier Entities Transaction, and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction, and, as
applicable, the Carrier Entities Transaction, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyer agrees to file or cause to be filed within 40 days following the
execution of this Agreement "Form A" statements or equivalent change of
control applications with respect to the Transaction and the Carrier Entities
Transaction with the insurance regulators or other Governmental Authorities
in each jurisdiction where required by applicable Law (it being
understood that such applications will include any material agreements
relevant to the operation of the Carrier Business following the
Carrier Entities Closing, including one or more managing general agent
agreements proposed to be entered into between the Agency Business and the
Carrier Business); _provided_ that the post-closing transaction structure
contemplated by any such application shall be substantially consistent with
_Schedule 3_ (unless an alternative transaction structure is required by the
insurance regulators or other Governmental Authorities) or as otherwise
mutually agreed by Buyer (upon the advice and consent of RIH) and Seller.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall take all actions
necessary to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in obtaining) any
Governmental Approvals (which actions shall include furnishing all information
required in connection with such Governmental Approvals) required to be
obtained or made by Buyer, Seller, RIH, NLC or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transaction, and, as applicable, the Carrier Entities
Transaction. Additionally, each of Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement (including
those set forth in Section 7(a)) and shall not take any action after the date
of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to impair or materially
delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Governmental Approval
necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing or the Carrier Entities Closing.
To the extent that transfers of any permits are required as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transaction, or, as
applicable, the Carrier Entities Transaction, the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to effect such transfers.

  



  

   

-35-

 



    

  



  

(b) _Notices and Consents_.

  



  

(i) Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of NLC and its Subsidiaries to give any notices to third
parties, and shall cause each of NLC and its Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents, referred to in the
items set forth in Section 5(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Each of the
Parties will (and Seller will cause each of NLC and its Subsidiaries to) make
any necessary Governmental Filings, and use reasonable best efforts to obtain
any Governmental Approvals (including, without limitation, approvals by the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, if Buyer elects
to file a notification thereunder, and the Texas Department of Insurance)
that may be or become necessary for their respective execution and delivery
of, the performance of their respective obligations pursuant to, and the
consummation of the Transaction, and, as applicable, the Carrier Entities
Transaction, and shall take all actions as may be requested by any such
Governmental Authorities to obtain such Governmental Approvals; provided,
however, that in no event shall any Party or RIH or any of their respective
Affiliates be required to agree to (A) the divestiture of any business or
entity, (B) any requirement imposed by a Governmental Authority that would
reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or (C) take
or refrain from taking any action or to become subject to any condition,
limitation, restriction or requirement that would reasonably be expected to
result in a Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this Agreement, 
"Burdensome Condition" means a term or condition of any Governmental Approval
that (a) would reasonably be expected to result in a required contribution of
more than $15,000,000 in additional capital (i.e., in excess of the amount set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) to the Carrier Entities or would
reasonably be expected to result in an adverse effect on NLC and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, of more than $15,000,000 (either such
circumstance, an " _Aggregate Adverse Effect_ ") or (b) would reasonably be
expected to result in an adverse effect on the aggregate value of the Carrier
Entities, taken as a whole, of more than $7,500,000 or the aggregate value of
the Agency Entities, taken as a whole, of more than $7,500,000 (either such
circumstance, a " _Separate Adverse Effect_ "). If an Aggregate Adverse Effect
occurs, then Buyer shall have the option in its sole and exclusive discretion
to (i) terminate this Agreement without liability of any kind, subject
to Section 8(b), or (ii) require Seller and/or its Affiliates (excluding NLC
and its Subsidiaries) to lend to Buyer an amount of up to $15,000,000 (the "
_Seller Debt_ ") to the extent that the Seller Debt will serve to mitigate the
adverse effect sufficiently to cause Buyer to not exercise the termination
right in Buyer's sole determination; provided that the Seller Debt shall be
issued on an unsecured basis with a maturity of two years and an annual
interest rate of 5% and such other terms as are mutually agreed by Seller and
Buyer. If a Separate Adverse Effect occurs, then Buyer shall have the option
(and RIH shall have the right to cause Buyer to exercise such option) in its
sole and exclusive discretion to (x) terminate this Agreement (provided that
each of Buyer and RIH shall receive no less than ten business days' notice of
the other Party's intention to effect such termination) or (y) require Seller
and/or its Affiliates (excluding NLC and its Subsidiaries) to provide
the Seller Debt to the extent that the Seller Debt will serve to mitigate the
adverse effect sufficiently to cause Buyer to not exercise the termination
right. If Buyer or RIH causes the termination of this Agreement as a result of
a Separate Adverse Effect, then Seller will receive a fee in the amount of
$5,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that Seller will receive
the Termination Fee if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8(a)(ii) and, at the time of such termination, (I) Buyer or RIH shall have
had the right to cause the termination of this Agreement as a result of a
Separate Adverse Effect (but not as a result of an Aggregate Adverse Effect)
and (II) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7(a) and Section 7(b)
shall have been satisfied or validly waived (other than one or both of (x)
Section 7(a)(i) or Section 7(a)(ii) and (y) those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions were
then capable of being satisfied if the Closing had occurred on the date of
such termination). In either circumstance described in the preceding
sentence, the Termination Fee shall be paid one-half (½) by Buyer and one-half
(½) by MGI by wire transfer of same-day funds within ten business days
following the date of termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Buyer determines to terminate this Agreement or RIH determines
to cause Buyer to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Separate Adverse
Effect, then Buyer or RIH (whichever was not so adversely affected by such
Separate Adverse Effect) shall have the right to prevent such termination and
acquire all of NLC and its Subsidiaries prior to the Outside Date in
accordance with the terms hereof, in which case no Termination Fee will be
due under this Agreement and in which case the Seller Debt shall be made
available to the party exercising its right to acquire all of NLC and its
Subsidiaries pursuant hereto.

  



  

  

(ii) Prior to the Closing, each of the Parties
shall promptly notify one another of any communication it receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Transaction, and, as applicable, the
Carrier Entities Transaction, and permit the other Party and RIH to review in
advance any proposed material written communication by such Party to the
Governmental Authority and shall provide each other and RIH with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between such Party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members
of its staff, on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Buyer may
redact from such correspondence, filings and communications any confidential
financial or competitive information of Buyer and its Affiliates and (B) no
Party shall be required to share information with the other if the sharing of
such information would violate any Laws or would be inconsistent with the
confidentiality provisions contained or referred to in Section 5(g)
hereof. The Parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other Party
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

(c) _Operation of Business_. Seller will not cause or permit NLC
or any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any practice, take any action, or
enter into any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of Business except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or with the prior written consent of
Buyer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and without the prior

consent of such party may be required by reason of the Transaction or, as
applicable, the Carrier Entities Transaction,

any other distribution in respect of any shares of capital stock or other
equity interests or repurchase, redeem or otherwise reacquire any shares of
capital stock, equity interests or other securities;

  



  

(E) sell, issue, grant or authorize the issuance or grant of (1)
any capital stock or other security, or (2) any instrument convertible into
or exchangeable for any capital stock, equity interests or other security;

  



  

(F) amend or waive any of its rights under, or accelerate the
vesting under, any provision of any of NLC's or its Subsidiaries' stock

Disclosure Letter, (1) grant to any Business Employee any material increase

limitation period applicable to any material Tax claim or assessment;

  



  

(M) commence or settle any material Legal Proceeding;

  



  

(N) willfully and intentionally take or omit to take any action
that is designed or reasonably likely to result in any of its

material respect at any time at or prior to the Closing;

  



  

(O) (i) change its investment guidelines attached hereto as

(d) _Full Access_. Seller will permit, and Seller will cause NLC
and each of its Subsidiaries to permit, representatives of Buyer and RIH
(including legal counsel and accountants) to have full access at all
reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of NLC and its Subsidiaries, to all premises, properties,

, Seller may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (i) applicable
Law requires Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit such
access; (ii) providing such access would breach a confidentiality obligation
to a third party after taking into consideration Buyer's obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement; (iii) such books, records, Contracts, and
documents relate solely to the sale process in connection with the Transaction
or the Carrier Entities Transaction; or (iv) providing such access would
reasonably be expected to result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client
or other applicable privilege or protection.

  



  

(e) _Notice of Developments_.

  



  

(i) Seller may elect at any time to notify Buyer
of any development, event or circumstance first occurring after the date
hereof that would have been required to have been disclosed in the Seller
Disclosure Letter if it had occurred prior to the date hereof. Unless Buyer
has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a)(vi) by
reason of the development and exercises that right within the period of 40
business days referred to in Section 8(a)(vi), the written notice pursuant to
this Section 5(e) will be deemed for the purposes of Section 7(b)(i) only
(and not for any other purpose, including, without limitation, with respect
to any indemnification rights in Section 9) to have: (A) amended the Seller
Disclosure Letter with respect to Section 4, (B) qualified the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4, and (C) cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have existed
with respect to Section 4 by reason of the development.

  



  

(ii) Each Party will give prompt written notice to
the other Party of any development causing a breach of any of its own
representations and warranties in Section 3 and Section 4 that would permit
the other Party to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 8(a)(iv)
or Section 8(a)(v), as applicable. Except as provided in Section 5(e)(i), no
disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section 5(e)(ii), however, shall be
deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Letter or Buyer Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, or to prevent or cure any misrepresentation or breach
of warranty.

(f) _Exclusivity_. Seller will not (and Seller will not cause or
permit NLC or any of its Subsidiaries to), directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or
take or permit any other action that results in, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to the submission of, any proposal or offer, from any Person
relating to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the capital stock
or assets of NLC or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange). Seller
shall promptly (and in any event, within 24 hours of becoming aware of any
such inquiries or proposal) advise Buyer orally and in writing of any such
inquiries or proposals of which Seller becomes aware. Seller shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates and representatives to, immediately discontinue
any ongoing discussions or negotiations (other than any ongoing discussions
with Buyer) relating to a possible acquisition transaction.

  



  

(g) _Confidentiality_. The terms of the letter agreement dated
September 12, 2019 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between Buyer and
NLC shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If, for any reason,
the Transaction is not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(h) _Change of Control of NLIC and NLASCONL_. Seller shall take
such actions as are necessary to cause, or cause its Affiliates to cause, the
following to occur on the Closing Date: (i) the resignation of the

Seller Disclosure Letter and the transfer and assignment of their
respective guaranty fund shares in NLIC and the rights and obligations under
their respective Trust Agreements with Excalibur Financial Corporation, in
the manner requested by Buyer (at the direction of RIH), to successor
underwriters designated by Buyer (at the direction of RIH); (ii) the
resignation of the directors and officers of NLASCONL set forth on Section
5(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter; and (iii) such other actions as may be
requested by Buyer (or, with respect to the Carrier Entities, the Carrier
Business or the Carrier Entities Transaction, RIH), including,
without limitation, executing related necessary or appropriate documentation,
in order to facilitate a change of control of NLIC and NLASCONL.

  



  

(i) _Financing_.

  



  

(i) Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain funds sufficient to fund the Required Amounts on or prior
to the date upon which the Transaction is required to be consummated pursuant
to the terms hereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the

promptly as possible but in any event prior to the date upon which the
Transaction is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof,
including by (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii)
negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and
conditions contained therein and (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all

(ii) Buyer shall not, on or prior to the Closing
Date, without the prior written consent of Seller: (A) permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements if such amendment,
modification, waiver or remedy (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any
existing) conditions to the consummation of all or any portion of the
Financing, (2) reduces the amount of the Financing, (3) adversely affects the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements, relative to the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date hereof or (4) could otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Transaction; or
(B) terminate the Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement. Buyer shall
promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment, modification, waiver
or replacement.

  



  

(iii) In the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Buyer will
(A) use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with the available portion of the Debt
Financing, to consummate the Transaction and to pay the Closing Purchase
Price) from the same or other sources and which do not include any conditions
to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous
than the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing and (B) promptly notify
Seller of such unavailability and the reason therefor. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include
any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question). Buyer shall provide Seller with
prompt oral and written notice of any actual or threatened breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters or
any Definitive Agreement and a copy of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender or Investor or other financing source with
respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
the Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof.
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a current basis of the status
of its efforts to consummate the Financing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, compliance by Buyer with this Section 5(i)(iii) shall not
relieve Buyer of its obligations to consummate the Transaction whether or not
the Financing or any other financing is available.

(iv) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide, and
shall cause NLC to provide, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause
their respective representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Buyer in writing necessary for the arrangement of the
Debt Financing, including by using reasonable best efforts to (A) to the
extent required by the Debt Financing, facilitate the pledging of collateral,
effective no earlier than the Closing, (B) furnish Buyer and the Lenders and
Investors as promptly as reasonably practicable following the delivery of a
request therefor to Seller by Buyer (which notice shall state with
specificity the information requested) such financial and other information
regarding NLC as is reasonably available to Seller at such time and is
customarily required in connection with the execution of financings of a type
similar to the Debt Financing ( _provided_  that Seller will have no
obligation to prepare pro forma financial information or post-Closing
financial information), and (C) provide all documentation and other
information about NLC and its Subsidiaries required by the Debt Financing
Sources to comply with "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, Title
III of Pub. L. 107-56, in each case as reasonably requested by Buyer at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; it being understood that
Seller shall have satisfied its obligations set forth in clauses (A) through
(C) of this sentence if Seller shall have used its reasonable efforts to
comply with such obligations whether or not any applicable deliverables are
actually obtained or provided. The foregoing notwithstanding, none of Seller
or its representatives shall be required to take or permit the taking of any
action pursuant to this Section 5(i)(iv) that: (i) would require Seller, NLC
or any of their respective Affiliates or any Persons who are officers or
directors of Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates to pass
resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Financing
or enter into, execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or
agreement or agree to any change or modification to any existing certificate,
document, instrument or agreement, (ii) would cause any representation or
warranty in this Agreement to be breached by Seller, (iii) would require
Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing (in the case of NLC and its Subsidiaries) prior
to the Closing or (in the case of Seller and its Affiliates other than NLC
and its Subsidiaries) at any time, (iv) would cause any director, officer or
employee or stockholder of Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates
to incur any personal liability, (v) would conflict with the
organizational documents of Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates
or any Laws, (vi) would reasonably be expected to result in a material
violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both) under, any contract to which Seller, NLC or any of their respective
Affiliates is a party, (vii) would require Seller, NLC or any of their
respective Affiliates, or any representatives of any of the foregoing, to
provide access to or disclose information that Seller, NLC or any of their
respective Affiliates determines would jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege of Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates, (viii)
would require Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates, or any
representatives of any of the foregoing, to prepare any financial information
or statements that are not available to Seller, NLC or any of their respective
Affiliates and prepared in the ordinary course of financial reporting
practice or (ix) would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Seller, NLC or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained in this
Section 5(i)(iv) or otherwise shall require NLC or any of its Subsidiaries,
prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Debt Financing. Nothing contained in this Section 5(i)(iv) or otherwise shall
require Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than NLC and its
Subsidiaries), at any time, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to
the Financing. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives in connection with such
cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective representatives from and against any and all losses
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Buyer pursuant to this
Section 5(i)(iv) and any information used in connection therewith (other than
information provided in writing by Seller or any of its Affiliates
specifically in connection with Seller's obligations pursuant to this Section
5(i)(iv)). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this Section 5(i)(iv) represent the sole
obligation of Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any financing (including the Financing) to be obtained by
Buyer with respect to the Transaction and no other provision of this
Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto) shall be deemed to
expand or modify such obligations. In no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Financing) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any other financing
or other transactions be a condition to any of Buyer's obligations under this
Agreement.

with the Financing;  _provided_ that such trademarks and logos are used

amendments thereto to be amended in order to make such sublease coterminous
with the existing term under that certain Office Lease, dated February 29,

(b) _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any
Party actively is contesting or defending against any Legal
Proceeding, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) the

its counsel in the contest or defense, make available his, her, or its
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to his, her, or its books

all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless
the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under Section 9 below).

  



  

(c) _Transition_. Seller will not take any action that is
designed or intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor,
licensor, customer, supplier, or other business associate of NLC or any of
its Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with NLC
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing and the Carrier Entities Closing as it
maintained with NLC and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and the Carrier
Entities Closing.

  



  

(d) _Insurance_. The Business and the operations and assets and
liabilities in respect thereof shall cease to be insured by Seller's or its
Affiliates' insurance policies, and neither Buyer nor its Affiliates
(including the Business) shall have any access, right, title or interest to
or in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and rights to make
claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover the Business or the operations or
assets or liabilities in respect thereof. Seller or its Affiliates may amend
any insurance policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to
this Section 6(d). Buyer shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for the Business and the operations and assets and

Affiliate's group health plans.

  



  

(v) With respect to each Transferred Business

who, as of immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to participate in a
tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller 401(k) Plans_"). As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, the Seller 401(k) Plans shall, to the
extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of the Code, make distributions
(including loans) available to Transferred Business Employees, and the Buyer
401(k) Plan shall accept any such distribution (including loans) as a
rollover contribution if so directed by the applicable Transferred
Business Employee.

11(b), the provisions of this Section 6(e) are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and neither RIH nor any current or former
employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan for any purpose.

  



  

(x) With respect to each Transferred Business
Employee whose employment is transferred from Buyer and its Affiliates to RIH
and its Affiliates in connection with the Carrier Entities Transaction (each
such Transferred Business Employee, a " _Divested Business Employee_

(g) _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing and the Carrier
Entities Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall cause their
respective representatives to maintain in confidence, and not use to the
detriment of Buyer, RIH or their respective Affiliates (including for the
purposes of competing with Buyer, RIH or their respective Affiliates), any
written, oral or other information relating to or obtained from Buyer, RIH or
their respective Affiliates, except that the foregoing requirements of this

provide Buyer written notice prior to such disclosure, or (C) any such
information was or becomes available to such Party on a non-confidential
basis and from a source (other than a Party to this Agreement or RIH or

and warranties contained in Section 3(a) or Section 4 of this Agreement shall
fail to be true and correct or Seller shall have breached or failed to perform

condition set forth in Section 7(b)(i) or Section 7(b)(ii) and has not been
cured by the earlier of (i) the date that is 60 business days after the date
that Buyer has notified Seller of such failure or breach and (ii) the Outside

and warranties contained in Section 3(b) of this Agreement shall fail to be

material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, and such failure or breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7(c)(i) or Section 7(c)(ii) and has not been
cured by the earlier of (i) the date that is 60 business days after the date
that Seller has notified Buyer of such failure or breach and (ii) the Outside

(vi) by Buyer by giving written notice to Seller at
any time prior to the Closing in the event (A) Seller has within the then
previous 40 business days given Buyer any notice pursuant to Section 5(e)(i)
and (B) the development that is the subject of the notice reflects any
failure of Seller's representations and warranties contained in Section 3(a)

not been cured by the earlier of (i) the date that is 20 business days after
the date that Seller has given Buyer such notice and (ii) the Outside Date;
or

expenses, regardless of whether arising out of third party claims (including

actually incurred in connection therewith, (y) direct, indirect, incidental,
consequential and special damages, but only to the extent such damages are
reasonably foreseeable, but excluding any punitive damages, except to the
extent such damages are awarded by a Judgment against, and paid by, a Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to a Third Party Claim and (z) any damages awarded by a
Judgment against, and paid by, a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to a Third Party
Claim) (collectively,  " _Losses_ ") that a Buyer Indemnitee suffers or
incurs (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Losses sustained or suffered
indirectly by a Buyer Indemnitee that are incurred by NLC or its Subsidiaries)
to the extent directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of or based
upon:

  



  

(A) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller set forth in this Agreement (other than any representation or
warranty contained in Section 4(m));

  



  

(B) any breach or non-fulfillment of any of the covenants or
agreements of Seller set forth in this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents;

  



  

(C) without duplication of any amounts taken into account in the
calculation of NLC Closing Tangible Book Value, (i) all Taxes of NLC and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and
the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_ "), (ii) any and all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which NLC or any of
its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, for which NLC or such Subsidiary is
liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or
similar state, local, or non-U.S. Law, (iii) any and all Taxes of any person
(other than NLC and its Subsidiaries) imposed on NLC or any of its
Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
Law, which Taxes arise from any action or transaction taken or entered into
by NLC or such Subsidiary before the Closing and (iv) any and all Taxes
arising from any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller
set forth in Section 4(m)(ix);

  



  

(D) any claims of any brokers or finders claiming by, through or
under Seller or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Transaction; or

  



  

   

-51-

 



    



  

(E) any Seller's Transaction Expenses (to the extent not paid by
or on behalf of Seller at the Closing).

  



  

(ii) _Provisions Relating to Seller 's Indemnity_.
Seller will not be liable for any Loss described in Section 9(a)(i)(A)
unless and until the aggregate of all Losses for which Seller is liable is in
excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the " _Threshold Amount_ "),
in which case the Buyer Indemnitees may make claims for indemnification for
all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ , that with respect
to any claim as to which a Buyer Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification
under Section 9(a)(i)(A), Seller shall not be liable for any individual or
series of related Losses which do not exceed Twenty Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000.00) (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") (which Losses shall not be counted
toward the Threshold Amount); _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section
9(a)(i)(A) shall in no event exceed Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000.00)
(the " _Cap_ ") ( _provided_ , that as it relates to Losses arising out of
any and all claims with respect to Fundamental Representations and Warranties
of Seller, the Cap shall not apply and the aggregate liability of Seller
relating thereto, together with all other Losses, will not exceed the Closing
Purchase Price) and (ii) Seller's aggregate liability for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9(a)(i)(B) and Section 9(a)(i)(C) will not, together with
all other Losses, exceed the Closing Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary above, the provisions relating to Seller's indemnity in this
Section 9(a)(ii) shall not limit any claim for indemnification by a Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9(a)(i)(A), Section 9(a)(i)(B) or otherwise as
a result of any fraud by Seller. The Threshold Amount and De Minimis Amount
shall not limit any claim for indemnification by a Buyer Indemnitee with
respect to a breach of any Fundamental Representations and Warranties.

  



  

(iii) Solely for purposes of determining Seller's
indemnification obligations under this Section 9(a) (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether any conditions
precedent to Closing under Section 7 have been satisfied), any qualifications
in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect to a Business
Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar terms shall be disregarded,
and such qualifications will not have any effect with respect to the
determination of whether there has been a breach of any representations,
warranties or covenants or the calculation of the amount of any Losses
attributable to a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of
Seller set forth in this Agreement or in exhibits, annexes or
schedules hereto, or in any Transaction Documents or certificates or other
instruments delivered by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
any taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, the
portion of periodic Taxes that are not based on income or receipts ( _e.g._ ,
property Taxes) for such period attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be computed based upon the ratio of the number of days in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the number of days in the entire period, and the
portion of any other Taxes that shall be attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be computed on a "closing of the books" basis, as if such period
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_.

  



  

(i) To the extent set forth in this Section 9(b),
from and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnitees against and in respect of all Losses that a Seller
Indemnitee suffers or incurs to the extent directly or indirectly resulting
from, arising out of or based upon:

  



  

(A) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

(B) any breach or non-fulfillment of any of the covenants or
agreements of Buyer set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

(C) any Taxes of NLC and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
commencing after the Closing Date and the portion starting after the Closing
Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date, other than Taxes for which Seller indemnifies Buyer pursuant to Section
9(a)(i)(C); or

  



  

(D) any claims of any brokers or finders claiming by, through or
under Buyer with respect to the Transaction.

  



  

(ii) _Provisions Relating to Buyer 's Indemnity_.
Buyer will not be liable for any Loss described in Section 9(b)(i)(A)
unless and until the aggregate of all Losses for which Buyer is liable is in
excess of the Threshold Amount, in which case the Seller Indemnitees may make
claims for indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount;
_provided_ , that with respect to any claim as to which a Seller Indemnitee
may be entitled to indemnification under Section 9(b)(i)(A), Buyer shall
not be liable for any individual or series of related Losses which do not
exceed Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) (which Losses shall not be
counted toward the Threshold Amount); _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) the
aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer is liable pursuant to Section
9(b)(i)(A) shall in no event exceed the Cap ( _provided_ , that as it relates
to Losses arising out of any and all claims with respect to Fundamental
Representations and Warranties of Buyer, the Cap shall not apply and the
aggregate liability of Buyer relating thereto, together with all other Losses,
will not exceed the Closing Purchase Price), and (ii) Buyer's aggregate
liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 9(b)(i)(B) and Section
9(b)(i)(C) will not, together with all other Losses, exceed the Closing
Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, the
provisions relating to Buyer's indemnity in this Section 9(b)(ii) shall not
limit any claim for indemnification by a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 9(b)(i)(A), Section 9(b)(i)(B) or otherwise as a result of any fraud
by Buyer.

  



  

(iii) Solely for purposes of determining Buyer's
indemnification obligations under this Section 9(b) (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether any conditions
precedent to Closing under Section 7 have been satisfied), any qualifications
in the representations, warranties and covenants with respect to a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect, materiality or similar terms shall be disregarded,
and such qualifications will not have any effect with respect to the
determination of whether there has been a breach of any representations,
warranties or covenants or the calculation of the amount of any Losses
attributable to a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer
set forth in this Agreement or in exhibits, annexes or schedules hereto, or
in any Transaction Documents or certificates or other instruments delivered by
or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

   

-53-

 



    



  

(c) _Notice and Defense of Claims; Settlements_.

  



  

(i) If any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee
seeks indemnification under this Section 9, such Person (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to other (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after receiving written notice of any Legal
Proceeding against it (if by a Third Party, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or
discovering the liability or facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, describing in reasonable detail the claim, the amount thereof
(if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure of the Indemnified Party to timely give the notice provided in
this Section 9(c)(i) to the Indemnifying Party shall not preclude the
Indemnified Party from recovering damages unless and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party can demonstrate that it was actually prejudiced and
damaged by such failure.

  



  

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
with respect to any such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall give written
notice to the Indemnified Party, promptly but in no event greater than 30
days after receipt of written notice of the indemnification sought, of the
dispute and describing those portions and the amount (if known and
quantifiable) of the claim in dispute, and the basis of the dispute. Upon the
Indemnified Party's receipt of a timely notice of dispute, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations within 15 days of the
Indemnified Party's receipt of the dispute of the claim, such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(iii) If a Third Party Claim is made which, if
adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity
pursuant to this Section 9, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party of the same in writing, specifying in reasonable detail
the basis of such claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in, or by giving written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim
at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own
counsel (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party), and
the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
in good faith in such defense.

  



  

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party shall control the
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to, at its own expense,
employ one counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party
in any such Legal Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of
such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying Party has
been advised in writing by counsel that an actual conflict of interest exists
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(v) If the Indemnifying Party shall control the
defense of any such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or
ceasing to defend such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement
or cessation, injunction or other equitable relief will be imposed against
the Indemnified Party, if such settlement does not expressly unconditionally
release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities with respect to such claim
and all other claims arising out of the same or similar facts and
circumstances, with prejudice, or if such settlement could adversely affect
any Tax or other liability of the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim.

  



  

   

-54-

 



    



  

(vi) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend any
Third Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Person in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 9(c)(v), pay, compromise and defend
such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses to the
extent resulting from, arising out of or based upon such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(vii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other
than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(viii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 9(c):

  



  

(A) If a Third-Party Claim includes or could reasonably be
expected to include both a claim for Taxes imposed on or payable by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than NLC and its Subsidiaries) (including by
reason of _Section 9(a)_) and a claim for Taxes that are imposed on or
payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including NLC and its
Subsidiaries), Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
sever such Third-Party Claim into separate Tax Proceedings relating to Taxes
payable by Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (other than NLC and its
Subsidiaries) and Taxes payable by Buyer and/or any of its
Affiliates (including NLC and its Subsidiaries), respectively. If such Third-
Party Claim is not so severable, Seller (if the claim(s) for Taxes that are
payable by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than NLC and its
Subsidiaries) exceeds or reasonably could be expected to exceed in amount the
claim(s) for Taxes that are payable by Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates
(including NLC and its Subsidiaries)) or otherwise Buyer (Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, the " _Tax Controlling Party_ "), shall be entitled to
control the defense of such Third-Party Claim (such Third-Party Claim, a "
_Tax Claim_ "). In such case, (1) the other party (the " _Tax Non-Controlling
Party_ ") shall be entitled to participate fully (at the Tax Non-Controlling
Party's sole cost and expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim, (2) the Tax
Controlling Party shall provide the Tax Non-Controlling Party with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Claim, (3) the Tax
Controlling Party shall consult with the Tax Non-Controlling Party before
taking any significant action in connection with such Tax Claim, (4) the Tax
Controlling Party shall consult with the Tax Non-Controlling Party and offer
the Tax Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any
written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax
Claim, (5) the Tax Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Claim diligently
and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with
such Tax Claim, and (6) the Tax Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of
the Tax Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The reasonable costs and expenses of
conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably
apportioned based on the relative amounts of the claim for Taxes payable by
Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (other than NLC and its Subsidiaries) and
Taxes payable by Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates (including NLC and its
Subsidiaries).

  



  

   

-55-

 



    



  

(B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall have the exclusive right to control any Tax Proceeding with
respect to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than NLC and its
Subsidiaries) or any consolidated, affiliated, fiscal, loss sharing, combined
or similar group of which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than NLC
and its Subsidiaries) is a member.

  



  

(d) _Survival_.  The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained herein and made pursuant to this
Agreement, and the rights of the Parties to seek indemnification with respect
thereto, shall survive the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except in
respect of any claims for indemnification as to which written notice shall
have been duly given pursuant to Section 9(c) prior to the expiration date
set forth below, (i) such representations and warranties, and the rights of
the Parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall expire on
that date that is 18 months following the Closing Date and (ii) such covenants
and agreements that require performance in full prior to the Closing, and the
rights of the Parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall
expire on that date that is 18 months following the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that those covenants and agreements which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing
indefinitely; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3(a)(i) (Organization of Seller), Section
3(a)(ii) (Authorization of Transaction), Section 3(a)(iv) (Brokers' Fees),
Section 3(a)(v) (NLC Shares), Section 4(a) (Organization, Qualification, and
Corporate Power), Section 4(b) (Capitalization), Section 4(c) (Brokers' Fees)
and Section 4(m)(ix) (Tax Matters) as well as Section 3(b)(i) (Organization
of Buyer), Section 3(b)(ii) (Authorization of Transaction) and Section
3(b)(iv) (Brokers' Fees) shall survive until thirty (30) days following the
expiration of all relevant statutes of limitations (it being understood that
"statutes of limitations" shall mean all statutes of limitations applicable
to the subject matter at issue and not merely the statute of limitations with
respect to a breach of contract claim); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4(m) (Tax Matters) other
than the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4(m)(ix) shall
not survive the Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, any claim for indemnification on account of breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement will survive the applicable
expiration date if a Party, prior to such expiration date, asserts such claim
in writing in good faith, specifying in reasonable detail the basis under this
Agreement for such claim.

  



  

   

-56-

 



    



  

(e) _Mitigation_.  Each of the Parties agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to Losses indemnifiable hereunder.

  



  

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, absent fraud,
claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9 and claims for specific
performance of the covenants and obligations of the other Party under this
Agreement will, collectively, be the sole and exclusive remedies for claims
and damages available to Seller and Buyer arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the purchase and sale of the NLC Shares or any certificate or
document delivered in connection herewith and all other rights and
remedies (whether at law or equity) are hereby expressly waived.

  



  

(g) _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all
Losses indemnifiable hereunder shall be net of (a) any net Tax Benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party in connection with the incurrence
of such Loss in or prior to the taxable year in which the indemnity payment is
made or in the next taxable year, calculated on a "with and without" basis,
net of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection therewith and (b) and third-party insurance proceeds that have
been recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification, net of costs reasonably incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection therewith (it being agreed that if any Tax
Benefit, third-party insurance proceeds in respect of such facts are actually
realized or recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying
Party's making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its
applicable indemnification obligation, the amount of such Tax Benefit which is
realized in the taxable year after the indemnification payment is made or in
the next taxable year or such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made). The
Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery under applicable insurance policies
covering such loss to the same extent as it would if such loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder.

  



  

Section 10. _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare or shall cause to be
prepared (i) any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than NLC and its Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and any of NLC and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and
shall include the income of NLC and its Subsidiaries required to be included
on such Tax Return (including, if applicable, any deferred items triggered
into income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-12 and any excess loss
account taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19 and any
such items under applicable analogous provisions of state, local or non-U.S.
Law) (a " _Combined Tax Return_ "), and (ii) any other Tax Return required to
be filed by or with respect to NLC and any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date (a  " _Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Return_ "). Buyer shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax
Return or any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). At Seller's request, Buyer shall file, or cause to
be filed, amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns; provided that Seller
shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the preparation and filing
of any such amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return. Except for any Combined
Tax Return or Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return, Buyer shall prepare and timely
file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to
NLC and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Buyer Tax Return_ "). If the preparation
and filing of or the payment of Taxes with respect to any Buyer Tax Return
would reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnification claim
pursuant to Section 9(a), affect the calculation of the NLC Closing Tangible
Book Value pursuant to Section 2(c) or would otherwise reasonably be expected
to increase the Tax liability of Seller or any of its Affiliates, Buyer shall
deliver to Seller for its review and comment a copy of each such Buyer Tax
Return at least 45 days prior to the due date thereof (taking into account
any extensions), or as soon as reasonably practicable if the applicable
due date is less than 45 days after the Closing or the end of the applicable
Tax period. Buyer shall revise such Buyer Tax Return to reflect any
reasonable comments (except to the extent any such comments would not "more
likely than not" be sustained on the merits within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6694-2(b)) received from Seller not later than 15
days before the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions), or as
soon as reasonably practicable if the applicable due date is less than 15
days after delivery of such Buyer Tax Return. Except as provided in Section
10(b), Buyer shall not amend or revoke any such Buyer Tax Returns without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

   

-57-

 



    



  

(b) _Certain Tax Refunds_. Any refunds or credits against Tax in
lieu of a refund attributable to Taxes for which Seller indemnifies
Buyer under Section 9(a) shall be for the account of Seller, and Buyer shall
promptly claim (including by filing any necessary Tax Returns, including
amended Tax Returns, if applicable, at the sole cost and expense of Seller)
and pay over to Seller any such amounts which Buyer has received in cash or
as a credit against Tax, net of any increased Tax liability of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including NLC and its Subsidiaries) by reason of the
receipt of such refund or credit and of any reasonable expenses of obtaining
such refund or credit, except to the extent such amounts have been or will be
taken into account in calculating the NLC Closing Tangible Book Value.

  



  

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. To the extent relating to NLC or any
of its Subsidiaries, Seller shall terminate or cause to be terminated, on or
before the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements or arrangements, if any,
to which any of NLC or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than NLC or any of its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, are parties, and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of NLC or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any rights or
obligations thereunder after the Closing.

  



  

(d) _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any applicable analogous provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Law), Seller, Buyer, NLC and their respective Affiliates shall treat any and
all payments under Section 2(c)(vii), Section 9(a) or Section 9(b) as an
adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price for Income Tax purposes.

  



  

   

-58-

 



    



  

(e) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Each Party shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other Party such
reasonable cooperation, documentation and information relating to NLC and its
Subsidiaries as either of them may request that is reasonably necessary in
(i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii)
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, (iii)
preparing any financial statement in relation to Taxes, or (iv) conducting
any Tax Proceeding or other claim or proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of
relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents
relating to relevant rulings or other relevant determinations by Tax
Authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of
relevant property and other relevant information, which any such Party may
possess; provided, however¸ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Party shall be required to provide any Person with
any Tax Return or copy of any Tax Return of (A) such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than NLC and its Subsidiaries) or (B) a consolidated,
combined or unitary group that includes such Party and any of its
Subsidiaries. Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

  



  

(f) _Post-Closing Tax Covenants; Certain Tax Returns_. Buyer shall
not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates (including NLC
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) to (i) make any election under
Section 338 or 336(e) of the Code with respect to the acquisition of any of
NLC or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) make, change or
revoke any Tax election (including any entity classification election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3) with respect to NLC
or any of its Subsidiaries that has retroactive effect to any taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, (iii) take any
action on the Closing Date or after the Closing that is outside the ordinary
course of business with respect to NLC or any of its Subsidiaries except to
the extent any such transaction is treated as occurring after the
Closing Date and is reported solely on Tax Returns of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including NLC and its Subsidiaries after the Closing), or (iv)
take any action or enter into any transaction, in each case, not required by
applicable Law or this Agreement that could reasonably be expected to
increase the liability of any of Seller or its Affiliates (other than NLC and
its Subsidiaries) for Taxes. Seller shall make an election pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) and Section 1.1502-36(e)(5)
to reduce its basis in the NLC Shares if such shares are "loss shares" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(f)(7).

  



  

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall each pay, when due, and be
responsible for, fifty percent (50%) of any sales, use, transfer (including
real estate transfer), documentary, stamp, value added, goods and services or
similar Taxes and related fees imposed on or payable in connection with the
Transaction (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The Party responsible under applicable
Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall
prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such
Tax Return to the other Party. Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate to timely prepare and file any
Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any
claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any
Transfer Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing Purchase Price set
forth in this Agreement is exclusive of Transfer Taxes.

Section 11. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. No Party shall
issue any press release or make any public announcement relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the
other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party will use its best efforts to advise the other
Party prior to making the disclosure).

(including the documents referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement
among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or

right, power or remedy accruing to any Party or RIH, upon any breach or
default of any other Party, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of
such non-breaching or non-defaulting Party nor shall it be construed to be a

authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign Law shall be deemed also to refer to all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires

(p) _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably, and in a manner
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, in the event any

specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
agrees that the other Parties (and RIH, with respect to the Carrier Entities,
Carrier Business and Carrier Entities Transaction) shall be entitled to an

Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States

(q) _Parent Guaranty_. To induce the Seller to enter into this
Agreement, Parent absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
Seller (the "Guaranty"), on the terms and conditions set forth herein the due,
full and punctual (i) payment of any amount payable by Buyer or any amount
due hereunder; and (ii) performance of all of Buyer's obligation pursuant to
this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). All payments hereunder
shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available
funds. The Guaranty is one of payment, not collection and Parent acknowledges
that a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against
Parent for the full amount of the Guaranteed Obligations to enforce
this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Buyer or
whether Buyer is joined in any such action or actions. Parent agrees that the
Guaranteed Obligations hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole
or in part, or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure or delay of Seller to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against
Buyer; (ii) the addition, substitution or release of any Person now or
hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting
Buyer; or (iv) the adequacy of any other means Seller may have of obtaining
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, Parent hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses
arising by reason of any Law that would otherwise require any election of
remedies by Seller. Parent hereby waives presentment, demand for payment,
notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of the
incurrence of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other notices of any
kind (other than notices expressly required to be provided to Buyer pursuant
to this Section 11(q)), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any
right to require the marshaling of assets of Buyer, and all suretyship
defenses generally.

  



  

(r) _Certain Financing Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Seller on behalf of itself, its
Subsidiaries and each of its controlled Affiliates hereby: (i) agrees that

or otherwise, involving the Financing Parties, arising out of or relating to,

any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so
long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof
and each Party irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any
such proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) agrees that
any such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in
the application of the laws of another state), except as otherwise provided
in the Debt Commitment Letter or other applicable definitive document relating
to the Debt Financing, (iii) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of
its controlled Affiliates to bring or support any proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Party in any way arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (iv) agrees that service of process
upon Seller, its Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliates in any such
proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
11(g), (v) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively
do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
proceeding in any such court, (vi) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any
proceeding brought against the Financing Parties in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance
of any services thereunder, (vii) agrees that none of the Financing Parties
will have any liability to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective controlled Affiliates or representatives (in each case, other than
Buyer or its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and
(viii) agrees that the Financing Parties are express third party beneficiaries
of, and may enforce, any of the provisions of this Section 11(r), and that
such provisions and the definition of "Financing Parties" shall not be
amended in any way adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior written
consent of the Financing Entities.
