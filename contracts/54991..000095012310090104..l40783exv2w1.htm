RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as defined below), are fair and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, and the Board of Directors has, as of the date of this Agreement, approved this Agreement and recommended its adoption by the shareholders of the Company; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, and Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make the representations, warranties and agreements specified in this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; and

Limited Partnership (the " _Voting Agreement_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

  

 Section 1.1. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (" _OGCL_ "), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") at the Effective Time, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. Following the Effective Time, the Company will be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") _._  

   

 Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Baker and Hostetler LLP, PNC Center, 1900 East Ninth Street, Suite 3200, Cleveland, Ohio 44114 at 9:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or 

   ##### 

  

 

waiver (to the extent waiver is permitted by applicable Law) of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent waiver is permitted by
applicable Law) of those conditions) or at such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing. 

   

 Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, immediately after the Closing, the parties will (i) cause the Merger to be consummated by delivering to the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the " _Ohio Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merge_ r") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section 1701.81 of the OGCL and (ii) make all other filings or recordings required under the OGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger will become effective when the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Ohio Secretary of State or at such later date as the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the OGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the assets and property of every description, and every interest in the assets and property, wherever located, and the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all obligations of the Company and Merger Sub will become the obligations of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided in the OGCL and other applicable Laws. 

  

 Section 1.5. _Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations_. The Certificate of Merger will provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be provided in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time) and (b) the Code of Regulations of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, will be the Code of Regulations of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, in each case, until changed or amended as provided therein and in accordance with the OGCL. 

  

 Section 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and the individuals specified by Parent prior to the Effective Time will be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SHARES; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT 

  

 Section 2.1. _Effect on Company Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the holders of any securities of the Company: 

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to _Section 2.1(b)_, _Section 2.1(d),_ _Section 2.1(e)_ and _Section 2.1(f)_, each common share, without par value, of the Company (the " _Common Shares_ ") and each Class B Common Share, without par value, of the Company (the " _Class B Common Shares_"), in each case issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Shares_ " and each, a " _Share_ "), other than (i) any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided, in _Section 2.1(b)_) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided, in _Section 2.1(e)_) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $21.60 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Company Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares and of Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to Company Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (as defined below) or Book-Entry Shares (as defined below) in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (b) _Parent-Owned and Treasury Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement. 

  

 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Shares_. Each common share, no par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding as a common share of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _Adjustments_. If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or share distribution with a record date during that period, or any similar transaction or any transaction having the effect of any of the foregoing, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect that change. 

  

 (e) _Dissenting Shareholder Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required by the OGCL, Company Shares that are issued 

   ##### 

  

 

and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any shareholder who was a record holder of the Company Shares as to which
such shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed for determination of
shareholders entitled to notice of the Company Meeting (as hereinafter
defined) and who shall not have voted in favor of adoption of the Agreement at
the Company Meeting and who files with the Company within ten (10) days after
such vote at the Company Meeting a written demand to be paid the fair cash
value for such Company Shares in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, unless and until such
shareholder fails to demand payment properly or otherwise loses such
shareholderÂ’s rights as a dissenting shareholder, if any, under the OGCL. If
any such shareholder fails to perfect or loses any such rights as a
dissenting shareholder, that shareholderÂ’s Company Shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into only the right to
receive at the Effective Time the Merger Consideration, without interest.
From and after the Effective Time, each shareholder who has asserted rights
as a dissenting shareholder as provided in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted under that section of the OGCL.
The Company shall promptly (but within three (3) Business Days after the
CompanyÂ’s receipt of notice) notify Parent of each shareholder who asserts
rights as a dissenting shareholder, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and reasonably direct all negotiations and proceedings (subject
to the CompanyÂ’s right to object to any actions or positions taken by Parent
that it deems, in its sole discretion, unreasonable) with respect thereto.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any rights of a dissenting shareholder asserted
under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, or agree to do or commit to do any of the
foregoing. 

   

 (f) _Share Options and Other Share-Based Shares Awards_. 

   

 (i) Each option to purchase Company Shares (each, a " _Company Shares Option_ ") granted under the Company Share Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested, cease to represent a right or award with respect to Company Shares and entitle the holder thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) at the Effective Time without interest an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company Shares Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Shares Option, with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash amounts hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of U.S. state or local or foreign Law relating to Taxes with respect to the making of such payment. 

   

 (ii) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive Company Shares or benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of Company Shares granted under the Company Share Plans or Plans (including restricted share units, deferred share units and performance shares) (other 

   ##### 

  

    

than Company Shares Options) (each, a " _Company Share-Based Award_ "),
whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to
Company Shares, shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder
thereof to receive from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay), at the Effective Time, without interest, (A)
with respect to restricted share units and deferred share units, an amount in

 (iii) The parties agree (A) that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Shares Option or a Company Share-Based Award or any participant in any Company Share Plan shall have any right hereunder to acquire any shares of capital stock or other equity interest (including stock appreciation rights, restricted share units, performance shares, phantom units, deferred share units and dividend equivalents) in the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, and (B) at the Effective Time, each Company Shares Option (whether vested or unvested) with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the Merger Consideration, in each case that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor and in full satisfaction and discharge of all rights of the holder held in such Company Shares Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.1(f)_, including, if necessary, using commercially reasonable efforts to enter into option termination or cancellation agreements with the holders of Company Shares Options, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation other than the payments provided in this _Section 2.1(f)_. 

  

 Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of holders of the Company Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable upon 

   ##### 

  

 

due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Company Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to this  _Article II_. Any cash
deposited with the Paying Agent above shall hereinafter be referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_." 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, (A) the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Company Shares whose Company Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (B) the Surviving Corporation shall mail to each holder of a Company Shares Option or Company Share-Based Award, a check in the amount payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ of this Agreement in respect of such Company Shares Option or Company Share-Based Award. 

   

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (if required by the Paying Agent), and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or such Book-Entry Shares an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_, and the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares or to a holder of a Company Shares Option or a Company Share-Based Award. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the relevant Merger Consideration to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be paid to the transferee thereof if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable share transfer Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration (without interest) as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) The Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation are entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares or holder of Company Shares Options or Company Share-Based Awards such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined) will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company will be closed, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the relevant Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Company Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Company Shares. 

  

 (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person will be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash must be limited to obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. federal government or an agency or instrumentality thereof, commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to  _Section 2.2(d)_. 

  

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or reasonably requested by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in a customary amount as indemnity and/or the providing of an indemnity, for the benefit of or to, as applicable, the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

 

Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate (and such affidavit of loss shall not be deemed effective without
the posting of such bond and/or other indemnity if required hereunder), the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Company Shares represented
by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger
Consideration.

 Section 4.2. _No Solicitation by the Company_. 

   

 (a) _Company Takeover Proposal_. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, representatives and agents and other advisors (collectively, the _"Company Representatives"_ ) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall request all other potential purchasers to promptly return or destroy all copies of all nonpublic information that the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives have distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of the Company Subsidiaries or its and their respective officers, directors and employees to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any of the other Company Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or offers or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise engage or participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any person (other than a party hereto or its representatives) any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate or further any inquiries or offers or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than in response to an unsolicited inquiry from a person and, in such case, solely to notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this _Section 4.2_); _provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited, written Company Takeover Proposal that (x) did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.2_ and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with _Section 4.2(c)_, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (including a standstill provision) not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the substance of all such information has previously been provided or made available to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party as of the date hereof, unless the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after  consultation with outside 

      ##### 

  

    

counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. 

   

 (b) _Definitions_. As used herein, (i) _"Company Takeover Proposal"_ means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of assets or a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity securities (by vote or value) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of the equity securities (by vote or value) of the Company, or (D) merger, consolidation, business combination, asset purchase, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company, in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) _"Superior Proposal"_ means a bona fide, unsolicited, written Company Takeover Proposal (except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%" and the references to "vote or value" shall be replaced by "vote and value") that the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after consulting with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account the financial, regulatory and legal aspects of the proposal and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal, is more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders (in their capacities as shareholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such Company Takeover Proposal). 

   

 (c) _Actions by the Company_. Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood and agreed that failing to recommend against or taking a neutral position or no position with respect to acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer, or a publicly disclosed merger or other business combination proposal, constituting a Company Takeover Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such offer, or receipt of such proposal, shall be considered an adverse modification), (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Takeover Proposal or (C) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a _"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"_ ) or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to result in, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 4.2(a))_ (an  _"Acquisition Agreement"_ ) _._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consulting with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, it may, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, (A) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant 

      ##### 

  

    

to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal or (B) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, but in the case of (A) or (B) only if: (i) the Company
is not in breach in any material respect of its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 4.2_, (ii) the Company provides written notice to Parent (a
_"Notice of Adverse Recommendation"_ ) advising Parent that the Board of
Directors intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including, if applicable, the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal,
the identity of the party making the Superior Proposal and copies of any
written proposal and all correspondence received from the third party relating
to such Superior Proposal that are the basis of the proposed action by the
Board of Directors; (ii) for a period of three (3) Business Days following
ParentÂ’s receipt of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation (or two (2) Business
Days after receipt of a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation; it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall be considered a new Notice of
Adverse Recommendation), the Company negotiates with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger and not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change (it being
understood that such negotiation need not be exclusive); and (iii) if
applicable, at the end of such three (3) Business Day (or two (2) Business
Day) period, the Board of Directors continues to believe in good faith that
the Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking into
account any amendments to this Agreement that Parent shall have agreed to
make prior to the end of such period). 

   

 (d) _Notice of Company Takeover Proposal_. The Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub of (i) the receipt, directly or indirectly, of a Company Takeover Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to a Company Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person or group making such Company Takeover Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of such Company Takeover Proposal and any material changes to the terms thereof. 

   

 (e) _Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Other Applicable Law_. Nothing contained in this  _Section 4.2_ shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside counsel), the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred to in 4.2(c) except to the extent permitted by _Section 4.2(c)_.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

  

 Section 5.1. _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Company Meeting_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (but in any event within fifteen (15) days after the date hereof), prepare and file with the SEC in preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to _Section 4.2_, include the Company Recommendation, and shall respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information as the Company may reasonably request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC. The Company shall afford Parent reasonable opportunity to comment on the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval there shall occur any event or any information should be known that should, upon the advice of the CompanyÂ’s outside counsel, be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare, file with the SEC and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or any other SEC filing required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall consider in good faith comments reasonably proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected in accordance with _Section 4.2_, the Company shall have no obligation to notify Parent of any matters to the extent that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside counsel, that to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders under applicable Law. 

   

 (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Articles and the Code of Regulations to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement (but in any event within thirty (30) days of mailing the Proxy Statement) for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "). Subject to making a 

      ##### 

  

    

Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_, (i) the
Board of Directors shall recommend to its shareholders the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.2. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated July 7, 2010, between the Company and Tektronix, Inc. (the _"Confidentiality Agreement"_ ), the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and ParentÂ’s representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement, to all of the CompanyÂ’s and each Company SubsidiaryÂ’s properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and all other information concerning their business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Parent shall hold, and shall cause its affiliates and ParentÂ’s representatives to hold, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent that doing so (i) would be reasonably likely to cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection (unless Parent enters into a joint defense agreement that protects such privilege), (ii) would constitute a violation of any applicable Law or (iii) would violate any agreement with a third-party to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party. Neither Parent nor any of its representatives shall be permitted to perform any onsite procedure (including any onsite environmental study) with respect to any property of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. 

   

 Section 5.3. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. 

   

 (a) _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including _Section 5.3(c)_, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Merger, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall make any material payment or commitment to a third party in connection with obtaining such consents, approval or waivers without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional 

      ##### 

  

    

instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _No Takeover Statutes Apply_. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any Takeover Statute or similar Law becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary and within their power to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Other Government Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, make or cause their respective ultimate parent entities (as that term is defined in the HSR Act rules) to make their respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals; (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may assert under Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take commercially reasonable steps to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to, and the Company shall not, without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, (x) agree to the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or (y) otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its subsidiariesÂ’ (including the Surviving CorporationÂ’s) or affiliatesÂ’ freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiariesÂ’ (including the Surviving CorporationÂ’s) businesses, product lines or assets; and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, from any third party or Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable

##### 

 

  

opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with any proposed written communication to any
third person or Governmental Entity with respect thereto. Each of the Company
and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. Any
competitively sensitive information that is disclosed pursuant to this 
_Section 5.3(c)_ will be limited to each of ParentÂ’s and the CompanyÂ’s
respective counsel pursuant to a separate customary confidentiality
agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall, and they shall cause their
respective subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, business, securities, person or subdivision thereof, if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially
increase the risk of not obtaining the applicable action, nonaction,

in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of individuals who on or
prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, unless such modification is required

 (c) _Welfare Benefits_. In the event a Retained Employee or such Retained EmployeeÂ’s eligible dependent(s) becomes covered by any group accident and sickness, dental, vision or similar group health plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its affiliates (a _"Successor Welfare Plan"_ ) other than the Company Welfare Plans in which such Retained Employee or such dependents participated (or from which they benefited) immediately prior to the Effective Time (a _"Prior Plan"_ ), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that (i) any such Successor Welfare Plan either shall not have, or shall not enforce against such Retained Employee or such dependents, any waiting periods, any pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions, or any underwriting requirements (whether imposed individually, or as a group), or any active-at-work requirements or conditions; and (ii) any expenses incurred by such Retained Employee or such dependents prior to the Effective Time, which were recognized as satisfying (in whole or in part) any deductible or co-insurance obligations such Retained Employee or dependent had under the terms of such Prior Plan prior to the Effective Time, shall be taken into account under such Successor Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying such Retained EmployeeÂ’s or such dependentÂ’s deductible or co-insurance obligations under such Successor Welfare Plan;

The Company shall be permitted to pay any amounts earned under the CompanyÂ’s annual management incentive plans for fiscal year 2010 ( _i.e._ , the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010) (the _"2010 Management Incentive Plans"_ ). Parent and Merger Sub agree that, if such amounts have not been paid prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor the 2010 Management Incentive Plans, and that all payments earned under the 2010 Management Incentive Plans shall be made in a manner consistent with the CompanyÂ’s past practice. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub agree that Surviving Corporation shall honor the CompanyÂ’s annual management incentive plans for fiscal year 2011 ( _i.e._ , the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011) (the _"2011 Management Incentive Plans"_ ) for the period prior to the Effective Time, including by paying the pro rata portion (based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal quarter prior to the Closing) of any payment earned with respect to the fiscal quarter in which the Closing occurs, and that all payments earned under the 2011 Management Incentive Plans for such period will be paid promptly after the Effective Time in accordance with the CompanyÂ’s past practice.

Parent shall be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Merger Sub in this Agreement. 

   

 Section 5.10. _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to review, if practicable, all material communications with the CompanyÂ’s and the Company SubsidiariesÂ’ employees relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Effective Time.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will bear and pay all of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement, all of the SEC filing fees in respect of the Proxy Statement 

      ##### 

  

    

and all of the fees of the proxy solicitor (which shall be retained by the
Company in consultation with Parent) in connection with the solicitation of
proxies from the CompanyÂ’s shareholders. 

   

 (b) _Termination Fee_. If (i) any person makes a Company Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_,  _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ and within twelve (12) months of the date of such termination the Company enters into an agreement providing for, or consummates, any Company Takeover Proposal with such person, (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or (iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ , then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $10,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of same day funds, in the case of the foregoing clause (i), on the date of entering into or the consummation of, as applicable, such Company Takeover Proposal, and in the case of clause (ii), on the date of termination of this Agreement, and in the case of clause (iii) within two (2) Business Days of such termination.

 (c) _Exclusivity_. Except as provided in _Section 7.2_ or for specific performance as provided in _Section 8.8(a)_, the Termination Fee payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ constitutes Parent and Merger SubÂ’s exclusive remedy for or in connection with any event or circumstance with respect to which such fee is so paid, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates may seek (and Parent and Merger Sub will cause their affiliates not to seek) to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties confirm that each event or circumstance giving rise to Parent and Merger SubÂ’s right to a fee under _Section 7.3(b)_ would cause significant damage to Parent and Merger Sub that would be inherently difficult to quantify and prove, and that the Termination Fee provided for hereunder is intended to provide fair compensation in response to that damage, is not intended to be punitive, and is reasonable in amount in relation to the circumstances under which it would become payable. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall be net of any amounts that may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Termination Fee due to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a legal proceeding that results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel) incurred by Parent in connection with such proceeding, together with interest on all such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

 Section 8.8. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Court of Common Pleas in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, or if (but only if) that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Common Pleas in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, or if (but only if) that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

Each of the parties, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 8.2._ 

   

 (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 

   

 Section 8.9. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after such approval, no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the Company shareholders may be made without such further approval.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. 

   

 Section 8.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon any determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
