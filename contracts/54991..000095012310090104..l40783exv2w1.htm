event within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the date hereof), prepare and file with the SEC in preliminary
form as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder the Proxy
Statement, which shall, subject to <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U>, include the Company Recommendation, and
shall respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company such information as the
Company may reasonably request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of the Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company&#146;s shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
filing with the SEC. The Company shall afford Parent reasonable opportunity to comment on the
Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval there shall
occur any event or any information should be known that should, upon the advice of the Company&#146;s
outside counsel, be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the
Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly
prepare, file with the SEC and mail to its shareholders such an amendment or supplement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or
any other SEC filing required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in each
case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and shall consider in good faith comments reasonably proposed by Parent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following a Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U>, the Company shall have no obligation to notify Parent of any
matters to the extent that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company&#146;s outside counsel, that to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors&#146; exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Company&#146;s shareholders under applicable
Law.

foregoing, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be obligated to provide any such

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Exclusivity</U>. Except as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;7.2</U> or for specific
performance as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;8.8(a)</U>, the Termination Fee payable by the Company
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;7.3(b)</U> constitutes Parent and Merger Sub&#146;s exclusive remedy for or in
connection with any event or circumstance with respect to which such fee is so paid, and none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates may seek (and Parent and Merger Sub will cause their
affiliates not to seek) to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of the Company Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties confirm that each event or circumstance giving rise
to Parent and Merger Sub&#146;s right to a fee under <U>Section&nbsp;7.3(b)</U> would cause significant
damage to Parent and Merger Sub that would be inherently difficult to quantify and prove, and that
the Termination Fee provided for hereunder is intended to provide fair compensation in response to
that damage, is not intended to be punitive, and is reasonable in amount in relation to the
circumstances under which it would become payable. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Any payment made pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> shall be net of any amounts
that may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. If the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Termination
Fee due to Parent pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.3</U> and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a legal proceeding that results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the Company
for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel) incurred by Parent in connection with such
proceeding, together with interest on all such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis from the
date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.
