WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and

which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ") will take place at 10:00
a.m., New York time, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
the third Business Day, after the satisfaction or waiver (by the party
entitled to grant such waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing), at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty
Plaza, New York, New York 10006 or at such other place or on such other date
or time as Alpha and Foundation may mutually agree.

(b) On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
Alpha and Foundation shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ ")
a duly executed certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), as
required by the DGCL, and shall take all such further actions as may be
required by Law to make the Merger effective. The date and time of the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State (or such later date
and time as shall be agreed to by the parties hereto and is specified in the
Certificate of Merger) is referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

Section 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Foundation
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to

amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by Law (subject to
Section 5.9(a)). The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in the
Merger to be Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.



 

2 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Foundation shall, by virtue of

of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law (subject
to Section 5.9(a)).

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers_.

(a) Alpha and Foundation shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, in accordance with their respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, to (i) cause the

the five individuals from the Foundation Board as constituted on the date
hereof that are selected by the Joint Committee prior to the initial filing of

persons who were nominated by the Foundation Board and/or appointed by
directors so nominated under the terms of the Foundation Loan Agreement (1)
in the case of Alpha, the four individuals (the " _Foundation_ _Director
Designees_ ") from the Foundation Board as constituted on the date hereof that
are selected by the Joint Committee (at least three of whom shall be
independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE) prior to the initial
filing of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement with the SEC (or if such
individuals shall have declined to serve, such other individuals from the
Foundation Board as constituted on the date hereof as designated by the Joint
Committee) and (2) in the case of Foundation, the six individuals (the "
_Alpha_ _Director Designees_ ") from the Alpha Board as constituted on the
date hereof that are selected by the Joint Committee prior to the initial
filing of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement with the SEC (or if such
individuals shall have declined to serve, such other individuals from the
Alpha Board as constituted on the date hereof as designated by the Joint
Committee). The result of the foregoing shall be that, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time, the Alpha Board and the Foundation Board will each be comprised of ten
members, six of which members shall be Alpha Director Designees and four of
which members shall be Foundation Director Designees. If there are changes to
the composition of the Alpha Board or the Foundation Board after the  



 

3  date hereof and before the Effective Time such that the foregoing provisions
of this Section 1.4(a) are incapable of being fulfilled at the
Effective Time, then the Joint Committee shall agree upon the composition of
an Alpha Board and a Foundation Board, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, that shall consist of six individuals from the Alpha Board, as
constituted prior to the Effective Time, and four individuals from the
Foundation Board, as constituted prior to the Effective Time, and shall cause
such individuals to be appointed to their respective boards of directors in
such a manner as shall have the consequences set forth in subclauses (A) and
(B) of clause (iii) above in this Section 1.4(a).

(b) (i) The Alpha Director Designees and the Foundation Director
Designees or such other individuals from the Alpha Board and the Foundation
Board selected pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.4(a) shall
comprise the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, (ii) subject to Section 1.4(c), the officers of Alpha
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be, and (iii) following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the
Foundation Director Designees are included in the slate of candidates
recommended by the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation for
election to the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the 2010
annual stockholders meeting of the Surviving Corporation (or, if such
Foundation Director Designees decline to consent to such nominations, such
other individuals designated by the Foundation Director Designees). It is
understood that each such director on the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation, as of the Effective Time, shall serve until the earlier of his
or her resignation or removal or until his or her successor is duly elected
or qualified.

(c) At the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to elect Michael J.
Quillen as Chairman of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation, to
hold such office until the earlier of his resignation or removal or until his
successor is duly elected and qualified. At the Effective Time, the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to elect Kevin S. Crutchfield as Chief Executive Officer of the
Surviving Corporation, to hold such office until the earlier of his
resignation or removal or until his successor is duly elected and qualified.
At the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to elect Kurt D.
Kost as President of the Surviving Corporation, to hold such office until the
earlier of his resignation or removal or until his successor is duly elected
and qualified. At the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to elect the
individual specified in Section 1.4(c) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule
as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the
Surviving Corporation, to hold such office until the earlier of his
resignation or removal or until his successor is duly elected and qualified.



 

4 Section 1.5 _Conversion of Shares_.

(a) Each share (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively the " _Shares_ ") of
common stock, par value $0.01, of Foundation (the " _Foundation_ _Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares owned by Alpha or any Subsidiary of Alpha, all of which
shall be cancelled without any consideration being exchanged therefor) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive 1.0840
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation
Common Stock_ ") (the " _Foundation_ _Merger Consideration_ "), upon the
surrender of the certificate or book-entry representing such Shares as
provided in Section 2.1. At the Effective Time all such Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Foundation Merger
Consideration as provided herein, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 1.6.

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Alpha (" _Alpha_
_Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Shares owned by Foundation or any Subsidiary of Foundation,
all of which shall be cancelled without any consideration being exchanged
therefor) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into and become one
share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (the " _Alpha_ _Merger
Consideration_ "). Without any action on the part of holders of Alpha Common
Stock, all outstanding certificates and book-entries representing Alpha Common
Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent a number of shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Alpha
Common Stock represented thereby immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 1.6 _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (after aggregating all shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such
holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) the
fractional share interest (after aggregating all shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock that would otherwise be received by such holder)
which such holder would otherwise receive, multiplied by (ii) the average
closing price of one share of Alpha Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ " for the five trading days ending on the last
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date, as such price is reported
on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as reported by Bloomberg Financial
Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing prior to
the Effective Time).

Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under
any of the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of Foundation
or Alpha as a result of,



 

5  or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of
this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Foundation
or Alpha, as applicable, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Foundation or
Alpha, as applicable, or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises
or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent
of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES AND CERTIFICATES; EQUITY AWARDS_

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates; Procedures_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Alpha shall engage, or shall cause to be
engaged, an institution selected by Alpha and reasonably acceptable to
Foundation ( _provided_ that Alphas transfer agent shall be deemed
reasonably satisfactory to Foundation) to act as exchange agent in connection
with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Foundation will deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time,
certificates representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
issuable to holders of Shares pursuant to Section 1.5. The Surviving
Corporation will also make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed from
time to time after the Effective Time, cash in amounts sufficient to make the
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and any
dividends or distributions to which holders of Shares may be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c). All cash and certificates representing shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The cash included in
the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent in such manner as
the Surviving Corporation shall direct; _provided_ that (i) no such investment
or losses thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former stockholders of
Foundation after the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II, and (ii) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to Sections 1.5 and 1.6
and this Section 2.1.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in no
event later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record
holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), a  



 

6  form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares, in exchange for (x) certificates (or uncertificated shares in book-
entry form) representing whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock,
(y) cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and (z) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Following
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Sections 1.5 and 1.6 (or uncertificated shares in book entry form), (2)
payment by cash or check in lieu of fractional shares which such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6, and (3) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), and the Certificates or
book entries evidencing the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
pursuant to Section 1.6 or Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered
is registered, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered
or established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and
until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent for all purposes solely the
right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Foundation Merger
Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6 or Section
2.1(c)) upon such surrender, without any interest thereon and subject to any
applicable withholding Tax pursuant to Section 2.5.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Share with respect to the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.6, until such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has been surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.1.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof,
without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor
pursuant to Sections 1.5 and 1.6, together with any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and
(ii) at the  



 

7  appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock.

(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate such
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock as may be required pursuant to
Section 2.1(b), cash for fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6 and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) with respect to
the Shares formerly represented thereby.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
former stockholders of Foundation for nine months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholder of
Foundation that has not complied with this Section 2.1 prior to the end of
such nine-month period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) but
only as a general creditor thereof for payment of its claim for the Foundation
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6 and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.1(c), without any interest thereon. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Shares for the Foundation Merger Consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any holder or former holder of
Shares for any monies delivered from the Exchange Fund or otherwise to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would
otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law,
any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) All shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.6 or
Section 2.1(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

Section 2.2 _Closing of Transfer Books_.

(a) At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of Foundation shall be closed, and no
transfer of Shares that were  



 

8  outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(b) At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of Alpha shall be closed, and no transfer of
shares of Alpha Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective
Time shall thereafter be made.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each compensatory option to purchase
Shares (a " _Foundation Stock Option_ ") outstanding under any Foundation Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time and set forth on Section 2.3(a) of the
Foundation Disclosure Schedule, whether or not then vested or exercisable,
shall become fully vested and shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation
and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a fully vested option
to purchase shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (a " _New Option_ ")
having terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth on
_Exhibit A_ , except that (A) the number of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock subject to each such Foundation Stock Option shall be equal to
the product of (1) the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of such
Foundation Stock Option and (2) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded
down to the next whole share, and (B) the exercise price per share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of such New
Option shall equal (1) the per share exercise price for the Shares otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Foundation Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time divided by (2) the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the next
whole cent) (such conversion being made in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)). The parties acknowledge that, with respect to any
option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the foregoing provisions are
intended to comply with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. The
parties agree and acknowledge that the conversion described in this Section
2.3(a) is not intended to result in a disqualification of any Foundation Stock
Options as "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section
162(m) of the Code, and agree not to take any position inconsistent
therewith.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each restricted Share outstanding
under any Foundation Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and set
forth on Section 2.3(b) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall become
fully vested as of the Effective Time and, in full settlement thereof, shall
be converted into the right to receive the per share Foundation Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section 1.5(a).

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit issued under any
Foundation Plan (a " _Foundation Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that is subject to
time-based vesting, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is
set forth on Section 2.3(c) of the  



 

9  Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall become fully vested as of the Effective
Time and shall, by virtue of the Merger and, except as provided in the
next sentence, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive the Foundation Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any holder of a Foundation
Restricted Stock Unit set forth on Section 2.3(c) of the Foundation
Disclosure Schedule that also holds a Foundation Cash Unit set forth on
Section 2.3(e) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall be required to
consent to the treatment of such Foundation Cash Unit described in Section
2.3(e) hereof as a condition precedent to the treatment of Foundation
Restricted Stock Units described in this Section 2.3(c).

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each (A) Foundation Restricted Stock Unit
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is set forth
on Section 2.3(d) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall become fully
vested and shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and converted
automatically at the Effective Time into a vested Surviving Corporation
restricted stock unit having the terms and conditions (including time of
payment) set forth on _Exhibit B_ , except that the number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to each such Foundation Restricted
Stock Unit shall be equal to the number of Shares subject to such Foundation
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) cash
unit issued under any Foundation Plan (a " _Foundation Cash Unit_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is set forth on
Section 2.3(d) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall become fully vested
and shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and converted automatically
at the Effective Time into one vested Surviving Corporation cash unit having
the terms and conditions (including time of payment) set forth on _Exhibit B_
; each such vested Surviving Corporation cash unit shall represent the right
of the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to $14.02.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and subject to the
consent of the holder thereof, each (A) Foundation Restricted Stock Unit that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is set forth on
Section 2.3(e) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation and converted automatically at the Effective Time into a
Surviving Corporation restricted stock unit having the terms and conditions
(including vesting and time of payment) set forth on _Exhibit C_ , except that
the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to each
such Foundation Restricted Stock Unit shall be equal to the number of
Shares subject to such Foundation Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), and (B) Foundation Cash Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is set forth on Section 2.3(e) of
the Foundation Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation and converted automatically at the Effective Time into one
Surviving Corporation cash unit having the terms and conditions (including
vesting and time of payment) set forth on _Exhibit C_ ; each such Surviving
Corporation cash unit shall represent the right of the holder thereof to
receive an amount in cash equal to $7.01.



 

10 (f) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume
the obligations and succeed to the rights of Alpha under the Alpha Plans with
respect to each compensatory option to purchase shares of Alpha Common Stock
and each unvested performance share, restricted share, or restricted stock
unit (each such restricted stock unit, an " _Alpha Restricted Stock Unit_ ")
or other equity-based compensation award issued under any Alpha Plan
(together, the " _Alpha Equity Awards_ ") (the assumption and conversion of
each compensatory option to purchase shares of Alpha Common Stock being made
in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)). Each Alpha Equity Award shall, immediately
following the Effective Time, relate to the number of shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock subject to such Alpha Equity Award prior to the
Effective Time, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Alpha Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties agree
and acknowledge that the assumption and conversion of compensatory options to
purchase shares of Alpha Common Stock described in this Section 2.3(f) is not
intended to result in a disqualification of any such compensatory options as
"qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of
the Code, and agree not to take any position inconsistent therewith. Prior to
the Effective Time, Alpha and Foundation shall take all action required to
reflect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3(f), including the
conversion of the Alpha Equity Awards that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and the substitution of the Surviving Corporation for
Alpha thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of
such Alpha Plans by the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all references to Alpha in each Alpha Plan pursuant to which any Alpha
Equity Award has been granted and in each agreement evidencing any award of
Alpha Equity Awards shall be deemed to refer to the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of capital stock, of Foundation or Alpha shall occur as
a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in this Section
2.4 shall be construed to permit either Foundation or Alpha to take any action
with respect to its respective securities that is prohibited or not expressly
permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.5 _Withholding Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration or other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger or this Agreement, including, without
limitation, consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
Sections 1.6, 2.1(c) and Section 2.3 of this Agreement, any such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid
over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. The Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all
amounts so withheld to the appropriate Governmental Entity within the period
required under applicable Law.



 

11 Section 2.6 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local Law, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Officers of Alpha
and Foundation shall execute and deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and
Flom LLP, counsel to Foundation, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP,
counsel to Alpha, certificates containing appropriate representations and
covenants, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsels, at
such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such counsels, including
the effective date of the Form S-4, the date of the Joint Proxy Statement and
the Closing Date, in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions,
pursuant to Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.3(d), with respect to the
Tax treatment of the Merger. Neither Alpha nor Foundation shall take or cause
to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or
cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of such
certificates and representations.

Except (a) as disclosed in the correspondingly numbered section of the
disclosure letter dated the date of this Agreement and delivered by Foundation
to Alpha with respect to this Agreement immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Foundation_ _Disclosure Schedule_ ") ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a matter disclosed in the Foundation Disclosure Schedule with
respect to one representation or warranty shall also be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to each other representation or warranty to the extent it is
reasonably apparent from the text of such disclosure that such disclosure
applies to or qualifies such other representation or warranty) or (b) as
disclosed in Foundations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2008 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") on March 2, 2009 and any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed

"), excluding any forward looking disclosures set forth in any "risk factor"
section or under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements" or any similar
sections containing disclaimers or cautionary forward looking disclosure in
any of such Filed Foundation SEC Documents, _provided_ that in no event shall
any disclosure in any Filed Foundation SEC Documents qualify or limit the
representations and warranties of Foundation set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.3,
3.5(a), 3.5(c), 3.7, 3.22, 3.23, 3.24 or 3.25 of this Agreement, Foundation
represents and warrants to Alpha as follows:

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

(a) Foundation is a duly organized and validly existing corporation in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with all requisite
corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business

organized and validly existing entity in good standing (where  



 

12  applicable) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with all
requisite entity power and authority to own its properties and conduct its
business as currently conducted. Foundation and each Subsidiary is duly
qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation or entity authorized
to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the
properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business
transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except as would not have
or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Foundation Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Foundation has heretofore made available to Alpha true, correct and
complete copies of the restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Foundation as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments thereto
(respectively, the " _Foundation_ _Certificate of Incorporation_ " and "
_Foundation_ _Bylaws_ "). 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Foundation consists of (i)
100,000,000 Shares and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Foundation (the " _Foundation_ _Preferred Shares_ "), of
which no Foundation Preferred Shares have been designated as to series. As of

16 Section 3.5 _Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) Each of Foundation and its Subsidiaries has timely filed or
transmitted (as applicable) all forms, reports, statements and certifications
required to be filed or transmitted by it with or to the SEC since January 1,
2006 (such documents filed or otherwise transmitted since January 1, 2006, the
" _Foundation_ _SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if
amended, as of the date of the last amendment prior to the date hereof, the
Foundation SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
" _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and, in each case, the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder. None of the Foundation SEC Reports, including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein, at the time filed or transmitted (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing prior to the date hereof), contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No executive
officer of Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries has failed in any respect to
make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Foundation SEC Report. True, correct
and complete copies of all Foundation SEC Reports filed or furnished prior to
the date of this Agreement, whether or not required under applicable Law, have
been furnished to Alpha or are publicly available in the Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC. Prior to the
date hereof, Foundation has made available to Alpha true, correct and complete
copies of all substantive written correspondence between the SEC, on the one
hand, and Foundation and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, since January 1,
2006. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff. To the knowledge of
Foundation, as of the date of this Agreement, none of the Foundation SEC
Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment.

(b) Except for Foundation Holdings Subsidiary, none of Foundations
Subsidiaries is, or since January 1, 2006 has been, required to file periodic
reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

(c) All of Foundations Subsidiaries are consolidated for accounting
purposes. The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes thereto) of Foundation included (or incorporated
by reference) (i) in Foundations Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal
year ended December 31, 2008 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") filed with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, as amended or supplemented by filings
with the SEC made prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Foundation_
_2008 10-K_ ") and in Foundations Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended March 31, 2009 filed with the SEC prior to the date of
this Agreement, as amended or supplemented by filings with the SEC made prior
to the date of this Agreement and (ii) in the Foundation SEC Reports filed or
otherwise transmitted with or to the SEC related to periods ending after March
31, 2009, have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles  



 

17  (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Foundation and its
Subsidiaries as of their respective dates, and the consolidated income,
shareholders equity, results of operations and changes in consolidated
financial position or cash flows for the periods presented therein;
_provided_ that unaudited interim financial statements may not contain
footnotes required by GAAP and are subject to normal, recurring year-end
adjustments that are not material in nature or amount. 

(d) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Foundation
and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Foundation or its accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any nonexclusive ownership and nondirect control that
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting
controls described below in this Section 3.5(d). Foundation has implemented
and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
required by Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act) that is designed
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and such system of internal control
over financial reporting is effective. Foundation (i) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a) of
the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Foundation in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames
specified by the SECs rules and forms (and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective) and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date of this Agreement, to Foundations outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Foundation Board (A) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Foundations ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Foundations internal controls over financial
reporting. Prior to the date hereof, a true, correct and complete summary of
any such disclosures made to Foundations auditors and the audit committee of
the Foundation Board has been provided to Alpha and is set forth as Section
3.5(d) of the Foundation Disclosure Schedule.

(e) Since January 1, 2006, (i) neither Foundation nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Foundation, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Foundation or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing  



 

18  Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Foundation
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation
of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Foundation Board or any committee
thereof or to any director or officer of Foundation or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(f) To the knowledge of Foundation, no employee of Foundation nor any of
its Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law
enforcement agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any
crime or the violation or possible violation of any applicable Law of the
type described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by Foundation or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of Foundation, any director, officer, employee, contractor,
subcontractor or agent of Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries has
discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner
discriminated against an employee of Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries in
the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act of such
employee described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(g) Neither Foundation nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
of any nature, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise,
known or unknown, whether due or to become due and whether or not required to
be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, other than
liabilities (i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Foundation dated as of the Balance Sheet Date
included in Foundation 2008 10-K or in the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the
Balance Sheet Date, or (iii) that would not have or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Foundation Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, Foundation and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, and neither Foundation nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action since the Balance Sheet Date that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Alpha, would constitute
a breach of Section 5.1(other than Sections 5.1(b), 5.1(d) and 5.1(r)).

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any change, effect,
event or occurrence that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Foundation Material Adverse Effect.

the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not

mailed to Foundations stockholders or at the time of the Foundation Special
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.7(a), no representation or warranty is made by Foundation with respect to
information or statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement that were not supplied by or on behalf of
Foundation. 

(b) Any other report required to be filed by Foundation or any of its
Subsidiaries with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the " _Foundation_
_Other Filings_ "), at the time of its filing with the SEC, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except
that no representation or warranty is made by Foundation with respect to
information supplied or to be supplied in writing by Alpha or any Affiliate
of Alpha expressly for inclusion therein. At the time of its respective filing
with the SEC and at the time any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with

regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.

or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates under ERISA or the Code,
or similar Laws of foreign jurisdictions.

_provided_ , _however_ , that a matter disclosed in the Alpha Disclosure

to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Alpha Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Alpha has heretofore made available to Foundation true, correct and
complete copies of the restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Alpha as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments thereto
(respectively, the " _Alpha_ _Certificate of Incorporation_ " and " _Alpha_

Section 4.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Alpha consists of (i) (A) as of the

Closing Date, 200,000,000 shares of Alpha Common Stock; and (ii) 10,000,000

thereunder or to which such award pertains, the expiration date, and the

Alpha Restricted Stock Unit or other equity-based award was granted. Since the
Capitalization Date, Alpha has not issued any shares of Alpha Common Stock

respect to the voting of capital stock or other voting securities of Alpha.

_SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the
date of the last amendment prior to the date hereof, the Alpha SEC Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in
each case, the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. None
of the Alpha SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed
or transmitted (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of
the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date
hereof), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. No executive officer of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Alpha
SEC Report. True, correct and complete copies of all Alpha SEC Reports  



 

42  filed or furnished prior to the date of this Agreement, whether or not
required under applicable Law, have been furnished to Alpha or are publicly
available in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR)
database of the SEC. Prior to the date hereof, Alpha has made available to
Foundation true, correct and complete copies of all substantive written
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Alpha and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, since January 1, 2006. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff. To the knowledge of Alpha, as of the date of
this Agreement, none of the Alpha SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC

Alphas Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2008
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, as amended or
supplemented by filings with the SEC made prior to the date of this Agreement
(the " _Alpha_ _2008 10-K_ ") and in Alphas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009 filed with the SEC prior to the

consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Alpha and its Subsidiaries as of their
respective dates, and the consolidated income, shareholders equity, results of
operations and changes in consolidated financial position or cash flows for
the periods presented therein; _provided_ that unaudited interim financial
statements may not contain footnotes required by GAAP and are subject to
normal, recurring year-end adjustments that are not material in nature or
amount.

of Alpha or its accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any nonexclusive ownership and nondirect control that
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting
controls described below in this Section 4.5(d). Alpha has implemented and
maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as required
by Rule 13a-15(a) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP, and such system of internal control over financial
reporting is effective. Alpha (i) has implemented and  



 

43  maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(a)
of the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by Alpha in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time frames
specified by the SECs rules and forms (and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective) and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to

reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect Alphas ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Alphas internal controls over financial reporting. Prior
to the date hereof, a true, correct and complete summary of any such
disclosures made to Alphas auditors and the audit committee of the Alpha
Board has been provided to Foundation and is set forth as Section 4.5(d) of

assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Alpha or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Alpha
or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported

respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Alpha Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of Alpha or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(f) To the knowledge of Alpha, no employee of Alpha nor any of its
Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law enforcement

Act.

(g) Neither Alpha nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any
nature, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise, known or
unknown, whether due or to become due and whether or not required to be
recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under

since December 31, 2008 that would be required to be reported by Alpha
pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act (an " _Alpha_ _ Interested Party Transaction_ ").

Section 4.22 _Required Vote of Alpha Stockholders_. The only vote of the
holders of securities of Alpha required by the Alpha Certificate of
Incorporation, the Alpha Bylaws, by Law or otherwise to complete the Merger is

Section 5.3 _Foundation No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Sections 5.3(b), (d), (e) and (g), Foundation shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and Foundation shall direct its and
its Subsidiaries Representatives (acting in such capacity) not to, directly
or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way
of providing non-public information) the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Foundation Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto (except to disclose the existence of
the provisions of this Section 5.3) or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, offers, proposals,
discussions or negotiations, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, a Foundation Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement relating to a Foundation Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any letter of intent, agreement or agreement in
principle requiring Foundation (whether or not subject to conditions) to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or breach its obligations hereunder, (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Alpha,
the Foundation Board Recommendation (a " _Change of _ _Foundation_ _Board
Recommendation_ "), or (iv) take any action to exempt any Person (other than

or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. Foundation shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by
Foundation, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives with respect to
any Foundation Acquisition Proposal. Foundation shall promptly cause to be
returned or destroyed all confidential information provided by or on behalf of
Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries to any such Person. Notwithstanding the
first sentence of this Section 5.3(a), prior to obtaining the Foundation
Stockholder Approval, if there is a portion of a statement in a written,
unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or may  



 

70  reasonably be expected to lead to a Foundation Acquisition Proposal received
after the date hereof that is not reasonably understandable or clear on
its face, then Foundation may submit a written question to the Person making
such inquiry, proposal or offer that is restricted exclusively to asking for
clarification of such portion of such statement (it being understood that such
request may neither provide information about Foundation, except to the
extent necessary to obtain such clarifications as may be reasonably required
to evaluate such written, unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer, nor
otherwise encourage such inquiry, proposal or offer), _provided_ that both
such inquiry, proposal or offer and such written request for clarification are
provided concurrently to Alpha with the delivery of such written request to
such Person.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(a),
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Foundation Stockholder Approval, (i) Foundation has received a written,
bona fide Foundation Acquisition Proposal from a third party that is not in
violation of such third partys contractual obligations to Foundation (it
being understood that, if such Foundation Acquisition Proposal is made in
violation of a standstill undertaking, then Foundation may grant a limited
waiver thereunder for purposes of permitting such Foundation Acquisition
Proposal not to fail to satisfy the requirement of this clause (i) that such
Foundation Acquisition Proposal not be in violation of such third partys
contractual obligations, but such waiver shall be made only to the
extent necessary to permit Foundation to engage in activities to the extent
expressly permitted by and in accordance with this Section 5.3(b) and Section
5.3(d) under the circumstances and under the conditions set forth in
this Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(d)), (ii) a breach by Foundation of
Section 5.3(a) did not result in the making of such Foundation Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) the Foundation Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with Foundations financial advisors and outside counsel, that
such Foundation Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Foundation Superior Proposal, and (iv) after
consultation with Foundations outside counsel, the Foundation Board
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action could reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Foundation under applicable Law, then Foundation and its Representatives
may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information with
respect to Foundation and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Foundation Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives), and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Foundation Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Foundation Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (x) Foundation will not, and
will instruct its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information
to such Person unless Foundation has, or first enters into, a customary
confidentiality agreement with such Person not less restrictive in the
aggregate to such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that
such confidentiality agreement shall contain a standstill obligation of
similar scope as the standstill obligation contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement that will expire no earlier than the later of (1) six months
following the execution of such confidentiality agreement and (2) 12 months
following the date hereof, which Foundation may waive to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Foundation to engage in activities to the extent
permitted or contemplated by and in accordance with this Section 5.3(b) and
Section 5.3(d) under the circumstances and under the conditions set forth in
this Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(d)), and (y) Foundation will promptly
provide or make available to Alpha or its Representatives any non-public
information concerning Foundation or its Subsidiaries provided or made
available to such other Person which was not previously provided or made
available to Alpha or its Representatives.



 

71 (c) From and after the date hereof, Foundation shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify Alpha in the event that Foundation
(including through any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives) receives (i)
any Foundation Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries other than
requests for information in the ordinary course of business of Foundation or
any requests made that are unrelated to a Foundation Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) any request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Foundation
Acquisition Proposal. Foundation shall provide Alpha promptly (and in any
event within such 24-hour period) with the identity of such Person and a copy
of such Foundation Acquisition Proposal or request (or, where such Foundation
Acquisition Proposal or request is not in writing, a description of the
material terms and conditions thereof). Foundation shall keep Alpha reasonably
informed (orally or in writing) on a current basis (and in any event no later
than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes, developments,
discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Foundation Acquisition
Proposal or request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and
of any material modification thereto). Without limiting the foregoing,
Foundation shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Alpha
orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or
engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning a Foundation Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(b) and shall in no event begin providing such
information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations until at least 24
hours after having provided such prior written notice to Alpha. Foundation
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict
Foundations ability to provide such information to Alpha. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.3(a) to the contrary, if (i)
Foundation receives a written, bona fide Foundation Acquisition Proposal from
a third party that is not in violation of such third partys contractual
obligations to Foundation (it being understood that, if such Foundation
Acquisition Proposal is made in violation of a standstill undertaking, then
Foundation may grant a limited waiver thereunder for purposes of permitting
such Foundation Acquisition Proposal not to fail to satisfy the requirement of
this clause (i) that such Foundation Acquisition Proposal not be in violation
of such third partys contractual obligations, but such waiver shall be made
only to the extent necessary to permit Foundation to engage in activities to
the extent expressly permitted by and in accordance with Section 5.3(b) and
this Section 5.3(d) under the circumstances and under the conditions set forth
in Section 5.3(b) and this Section 5.3(d)), (ii) a breach by Foundation of
Section 5.3(a) did not result in the making of such Foundation Acquisition
Proposal, and (iii) the Foundation Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, after giving effect
to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered
by Alpha pursuant to clause (B) below, that such Foundation Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Foundation Superior Proposal, the Foundation Board may
at any time prior to obtaining the Foundation Stockholder Approval, if
it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Foundation under applicable Law,
(1) effect a Change of Foundation Board Recommendation  



 

72  and/or (2) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j) and this
Section 5.3(d), it being understood that such termination shall not
be effective unless, concurrently with such termination, Foundation enters
into a written definitive agreement for such Foundation Superior Proposal and
Foundation pays to Alpha the Foundation Termination Fee required to be paid
under Section 7.3(f); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Foundation Board may
not effect such a Change of Foundation Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j) and this Section 5.3(d) unless (A)
Foundation shall have provided prior written notice to Alpha, at least three
Business Days in advance (the " _Foundation_ _Notice Period_ "), of its
intention to take such action with respect to such Foundation
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Foundation Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Foundation Superior Proposal) and, in the case of a
proposed termination pursuant to Section 7.1(j), shall include a copy of the
proposed definitive agreement to be entered into concurrently with and as a
condition to such termination, (B) prior to taking such action, Foundation
shall, and shall direct its financial and legal advisors to, during such
Foundation Notice Period, negotiate with Alpha in good faith (to the extent
Alpha desires to negotiate in good faith) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Foundation Acquisition
Proposal ceases to constitute a Foundation Superior Proposal, and (C)
following any negotiation described in the immediately preceding clause (B),
such Foundation Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Foundation
Superior Proposal. In the event of any revisions to the terms of a Foundation
Superior Proposal that are material to such Foundation Superior Proposal after
the start of the Foundation Notice Period, Foundation shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Alpha satisfying the requirements of clause
(A) of the preceding sentence and to comply with the requirements of this
Section 5.3(d) with respect to such new written notice, and the Foundation
Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new
notice.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.3(a) to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Foundation Stockholder Approval, the Foundation
Board may effect a Change of Foundation Board Recommendation, if the
Foundation Board (i) determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make such Change of Foundation
Board Recommendation could reasonably be expected to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Foundation under applicable Law, and
(ii) determines in good faith that the reasons for making such Change of
Foundation Board Recommendation are independent of any pending Foundation
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Foundation Board may
not effect such a Change of Foundation Board Recommendation pursuant to this
Section 5.3(e) unless (A) Foundation shall have provided prior written notice
to Alpha, at least three Business Days in advance, of its intention to make
such Change of Foundation Board Recommendation, which notice shall specify
the material facts and information constituting the basis for such
contemplated determination, and (B) prior to effecting such Change of
Foundation Board Recommendation, Foundation shall, and shall direct
its financial and legal advisors to, during such three Business Day period,
negotiate with Alpha in good faith (to the extent Alpha desires to negotiate
in good faith) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement which would allow the Foundation Board not to make such Change of
Foundation Board Recommendation consistent with its fiduciary duties.



 

73 (f) Foundation agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.3 by any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives (acting
in such capacity), including any violation by a Representative (acting in such
capacity) of a direction given to a Representative pursuant to the
first sentence of Section 5.3(a) shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement (including this Section 5.3) by Foundation.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Foundation
Board from (x) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Foundation a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (y) making any required disclosure to Foundations
stockholders if in the good faith judgment of the Foundation Board, after
consultation with Foundations outside counsel, failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to violate its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ that any public disclosure relating or in response
to a Foundation Acquisition Proposal other than (A) a "stop, look and listen"
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, (B) an express rejection of any applicable Foundation
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) an express reaffirmation of its recommendation
to its stockholders in favor of the Merger, shall be deemed to be a Change of
Foundation Board Recommendation for purposes of Section 7.1(h).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Foundation_ _Acquisition
Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or proposal made by a Person or group
(other than Alpha or any of its Affiliates) at any time after the date hereof
relating to a transaction or potential transaction which is structured to
permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 15% of
the assets or businesses of, Foundation and its Subsidiaries, or at least 15%
of the equity or any class of equity of Foundation or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or
exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the
Merger, and (ii) " _Foundation_ _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona
fide Foundation Acquisition Proposal (except the references in the definition
thereof to "15%" shall be replaced by "more than 50%") made in writing after
the date hereof that the Foundation Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with Foundations financial advisor and outside counsel)
is more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Foundation
Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such Foundation Acquisition Proposal, including all legal,
financial, regulatory, likelihood and timing of consummation and other aspects
of such Foundation Acquisition Proposal.

Section 5.4 _Alpha No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Sections 5.4(b), (d), (e) and (g), Alpha shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and Alpha shall direct its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives (acting in such capacity) not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of
providing non-public information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals
or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alpha
Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto (except to  



 

74  disclose the existence of the provisions of this Section 5.4) or otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any
such inquiries, offers, proposals, discussions or negotiations, (ii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Alpha
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent,

or agreement in principle requiring Alpha (whether or not subject to
conditions) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, (iii) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Foundation, the Alpha Board Recommendation (a " _Change of_
_Alpha_ _Board Recommendation_ "), or (iv) take any action to exempt any
Person (other than Foundation and its Affiliates) from the restrictions
contained in any Takeover Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply. Alpha shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted theretofore by Alpha, its Subsidiaries or any of its
Representatives with respect to any Alpha Acquisition Proposal. Alpha shall
promptly cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information
provided by or on behalf of Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries to any such
Person. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 5.4(a), prior to
obtaining the Alpha Stockholder Approval, if there is a portion of a statement
in a written, unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or
may reasonably be expected to lead to an Alpha Acquisition Proposal received
after the date hereof that is not reasonably understandable or clear on its
face, then Alpha may submit a written question to the Person making such
inquiry, proposal or offer that is restricted exclusively to asking for
clarification of such portion of such statement (it being understood that such
request may neither provide information about Alpha, except to the extent
necessary to obtain such clarifications as may be reasonably required to
evaluate such written, unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer, nor otherwise
encourage such inquiry, proposal or offer), _provided_ that both such inquiry,
proposal or offer and such written request for clarification are provided
concurrently to Foundation with the delivery of such written request to such
Person.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a),
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Alpha Stockholder Approval, (i) Alpha has received a written, bona fide Alpha
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that is not in violation of such third
partys contractual obligations to Alpha (it being understood that, if such
Alpha Acquisition Proposal is made in violation of a standstill undertaking,
then Alpha may grant a limited waiver thereunder for purposes of permitting
such Alpha Acquisition Proposal not to fail to satisfy the requirement of this
clause (i) that such Alpha Acquisition Proposal not be in violation of such
third partys contractual obligations, but such waiver shall be made only to
the extent necessary to permit Alpha to engage in activities to the extent
expressly permitted by and in accordance with this Section 5.4(b) and Section
5.4(d) under the circumstances and under the conditions set forth in this
Section 5.4(b) and Section 5.4(d)), (ii) a breach by Alpha of Section 5.4(a)
did not result in the making of such Alpha Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the
Alpha Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Alphas
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Alpha Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alpha Superior
Proposal, and (iv) after consultation with Alphas outside counsel, the Alpha
Board determines in good faith that the  



 

75  failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Alpha under applicable
Law, then Alpha and its Representatives may, subject to clauses (x) and (y)
below, (A) furnish information with respect to Alpha and its Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Alpha Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives),
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Alpha Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Alpha
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (x) Alpha will not, and will instruct
its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless Alpha has, or first enters into, a customary confidentiality
agreement with such Person not less restrictive in the aggregate to such
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement shall contain a standstill obligation of similar
scope as the standstill obligation contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
that will expire no earlier than the later of (1) six months following the
execution of such confidentiality agreement and (2) 12 months following the
date hereof, which Alpha may waive to the extent reasonably necessary to

circumstances and under the conditions set forth in this Section 5.4(b) and
Section 5.4(d)), and (y) Alpha will promptly provide or make available to
Foundation or its Representatives any non-public information concerning Alpha
or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person which was
not previously provided or made available to Foundation or its
Representatives. 

(c) From and after the date hereof, Alpha shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Foundation in the event that Alpha (including
through any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives) receives (i) any Alpha
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the
ordinary course of business of Alpha or any requests made that are unrelated
to an Alpha Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Alpha Acquisition Proposal. Alpha shall provide
Foundation promptly (and in any event within such 24-hour period) with the
identity of such Person and a copy of such Alpha Acquisition Proposal or
request (or, where such Alpha Acquisition Proposal or request is not in
writing, a description of the material terms and conditions thereof). Alpha
shall keep Foundation reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a current
basis (and in any event no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of
any Alpha Acquisition Proposal or request (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and of any material modification thereto). Without limiting
the foregoing, Alpha shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify

that would restrict Alphas ability to provide such information to Foundation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.4(a) to the contrary, if (i)
Alpha receives a written, bona fide Alpha Acquisition Proposal from a third
party that is not in  



 

76  violation of such third partys contractual obligations to Alpha (it being
understood that, if such Alpha Acquisition Proposal is made in violation of
a standstill undertaking, then Alpha may grant a limited waiver thereunder

engage in activities to the extent expressly permitted by and in accordance
with Section 5.4(b) and this Section 5.4(d) under the circumstances and under
the conditions set forth in Section 5.4(b) and this Section 5.4(d)), (ii) a
breach by Alpha of Section 5.4(a) did not result in the making of such Alpha
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the Alpha Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be
offered by Foundation pursuant to clause (B) below, that such Alpha
Acquisition Proposal constitutes an Alpha Superior Proposal, the Alpha Board
may at any time prior to obtaining the Alpha Stockholder Approval, if it
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Alpha under applicable Law, (1) effect
a Change of Alpha Board Recommendation and/or (2) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(k) and this Section 5.4(d), it being understood that
such termination shall not be effective unless, concurrently with such
termination, Alpha enters into a written definitive agreement for such
Alpha Superior Proposal and Alpha pays to Foundation the Alpha Termination
Fee required to be paid under Section 7.3(g); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Alpha Board may not effect such a Change of Alpha Board Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(k) and this Section 5.4(d)
unless (A) Alpha shall have provided prior written notice to Foundation, at
least three Business Days in advance (the " _Alpha_ _Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to take such action with respect to such Alpha Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
such Alpha Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Alpha Superior Proposal) and, in the case of a proposed termination pursuant
to Section 7.1(k), shall include a copy of the proposed definitive agreement
to be entered into concurrently with and as a condition to such termination,
(B) prior to taking such action, Alpha shall, and shall direct its financial
and legal advisors to, during such Alpha Notice Period, negotiate with
Foundation in good faith (to the extent Foundation desires to negotiate in
good faith) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Alpha Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute an
Alpha Superior Proposal, and (C) following any negotiation described in the
immediately preceding clause (B), such Alpha Acquisition Proposal continues
to constitute an Alpha Superior Proposal. In the event of any revisions to the
terms of the Alpha Superior Proposal that are material to such Alpha Superior
Proposal after the start of the Alpha Notice Period, Alpha shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Foundation satisfying the requirements of
clause (A) of the preceding sentence and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.4(d) with respect to such new written notice, and the Alpha
Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new
notice.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.4(a) to the contrary, at any
time prior to obtaining the Alpha Stockholder Approval, the Alpha Board may
effect a Change of Alpha Board Recommendation, if the Alpha Board (i)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to make such Change of Alpha Board Recommendation could reasonably be
expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the  



 

77  stockholders of Alpha under applicable Law, and (ii) determines in good
faith that the reasons for making such Change of Alpha Board Recommendation
are independent of any pending Alpha Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Alpha Board may not effect such a Change of Alpha Board
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.4(e) unless (A) Alpha shall have
provided prior written notice to Foundation, at least three Business Days in
advance, of its intention to make such Change of Alpha Board Recommendation,
which notice shall specify the material facts and information constituting the
basis for such contemplated determination, and (B) prior to effecting such
Change of Alpha Board Recommendation, Alpha shall, and shall direct its
financial and legal advisors to, during such three Business Day period,
negotiate with Foundation in good faith (to the extent Foundation desires to
negotiate in good faith) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement which would allow the Alpha Board not to make such Change of
Alpha Board Recommendation consistent with its fiduciary duties.

(f) Alpha agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.4 by any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives (acting
in such capacity), including any violation by a Representative (acting in such
capacity) of a direction given to a Representative pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 5.4(a) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
(including this Section 5.4) by Alpha.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Alpha Board
from (x) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Alpha a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or (y) making any required disclosure to Alphas stockholders if in the
good faith judgment of the Alpha Board, after consultation with Alphas
outside counsel, failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to violate its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ that any public
disclosure relating or in response to an Alpha Acquisition Proposal other than
(A) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (B) an express rejection
of any applicable Alpha Acquisition Proposal, or (C) an express reaffirmation
of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Merger, shall be
deemed to be a Change of Alpha Board Recommendation for purposes of Section
7.1(i).

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Alpha_ _Acquisition Proposal_
" means any inquiry, offer or proposal made by a Person or group (other than
Foundation or any of its Affiliates) at any time after the date hereof
relating to a transaction or potential transaction which is structured to
permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 15% of
the assets or businesses of, Alpha and its Subsidiaries, or at least 15% of
the equity or any class of equity of Alpha or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer
or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step
transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the
Merger, and (ii) " _Alpha_ _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide
Alpha Acquisition Proposal (except the references in the definition thereof
to "15%" shall be replaced by "more than 50%") made in writing after the date
hereof that the Alpha Board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with Alphas financial advisor and outside counsel) is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Alpha  



 

78  Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such Alpha Acquisition Proposal, including all legal,
financial, regulatory, likelihood and timing of consummation and other
aspects of such Alpha Acquisition Proposal.

Section 5.5 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Listing_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Alpha and Foundation shall prepare and file with the SEC the Joint
Proxy Statement, and Foundation shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form
S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a proxy
statement/prospectus; _provided_ that the parties acknowledge that their goal
is to file the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 within 15 Business Days
after the date of this Agreement and that if they do not file Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 within such period, the appropriate senior
executive officers of Alpha and Foundation shall discuss the reasons for the
failure to meet such goal. Each of Foundation and Alpha shall obtain
and furnish the information concerning itself and its Affiliates required to
be included in the Joint Proxy Statement and in the Form S-4. Each of Alpha
and Foundation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing. Alpha shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement to
be mailed to Alphas stockholders, and Foundation shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to Foundations stockholders, in each case as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Foundation shall also take any action (other than qualifying
to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or
filing a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the issuance and
reservation of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock in the Merger,
and Alpha shall furnish all information concerning Alpha and the holders of
Alpha Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Alpha or Foundation, as applicable,
without the others prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other the opportunity to
review and comment thereon. Alpha or Foundation, as applicable, will advise
the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when
the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of
the Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information and will promptly provide the other with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. Alpha
and Foundation shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts,
after consultation with each other, to resolve all such requests or comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to Alpha or Foundation, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Alpha or Foundation which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which  



 

79  they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the respective
stockholders of Alpha and Foundation.

(b) Foundation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time. Each of Alpha and Foundation shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to continue the listing of the Alpha Common
Stock and the Foundation Common Stock on the NYSE during the term of this
Agreement to the extent necessary so that appraisal rights will not be
available to stockholders of Foundation or Alpha under Section 262 of the
DGCL.

 

Section 5.6 _Stockholder Approvals_.

(a) Foundation shall, in accordance with applicable Law, the Foundation
Certificate of Incorporation and the Foundation Bylaws, call a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Foundation_ _Special Meeting_ ") to be held as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 becomes effective, for the
purpose of obtaining the Foundation Stockholder Approval in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such meeting to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Form S-4 becomes effective. Except in the event of a Change of
Foundation Board Recommendation specifically permitted by Sections 5.3(d) or
5.3(e), the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the
Foundation Board that Foundations stockholders adopt the "agreement of
merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated by Foundation or Alpha
in accordance with its terms pursuant to Article VII and except for disclosing
a Change of Foundation Board Recommendation as permitted by the immediately
preceding sentence, Foundation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain from its stockholders the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as
such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement as
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by soliciting proxies in favor of such adoption and taking all other
reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote of the holders of
Shares required by applicable Law to obtain such adoption. Unless this
Agreement is validly terminated by Foundation or Alpha in accordance with its
terms pursuant to Article VII prior to the date of the Foundation Special
Meeting, Foundation shall submit the "agreement of merger" (as such term is
used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement to its
stockholders for adoption at the Foundation Special Meeting even if the
Foundation Board shall have effected a Change of Foundation Board
Recommendation.

(b) Alpha shall, in accordance with applicable Law, the
Alpha Certificate of Incorporation and the Alpha Bylaws, call a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Alpha_ _Special Meeting_ ") to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 becomes effective, for the purpose
of obtaining the Alpha Stockholder Approval in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such meeting to occur  



 

80  as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 becomes effective.
Except in the event of a Change of Alpha Board Recommendation
specifically permitted by Sections 5.4(d) or 5.4(e), the Joint Proxy
Statement shall include the recommendation of the Alpha Board that Alphas
stockholders adopt the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section
251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement. Unless this Agreement is
validly terminated by Foundation or Alpha in accordance with its terms
pursuant to Article VII and except for disclosing a Change of Alpha Board
Recommendation as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence, Alpha
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from its stockholders
the adoption of the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251
of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement as required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by soliciting proxies
in favor of such adoption and taking all other reasonable actions necessary or
advisable to secure the vote of the holders of shares of Alpha Common Stock
required by applicable Law to obtain such adoption. Unless this Agreement is
validly terminated by Foundation or Alpha in accordance with its terms
pursuant to Article VII prior to the date of the Alpha Special Meeting, Alpha
shall submit the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251
of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement to its stockholders for adoption at
the Alpha Special Meeting even if the Alpha Board shall have effected a Change
of Alpha Board Recommendation.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, unless this Agreement is validly
terminated by Foundation or Alpha in accordance with its terms pursuant to
Article VII, Foundation and Alpha shall coordinate to cause the Foundation
Special Meeting and the Alpha Special Meeting, respectively, to occur on the
same date and during substantially the same time period.

Section 5.7 _Access to Information_.

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the restrictions imposed
by the HSR Act and applicable Law, from and after the date of this Agreement
through the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, each of Foundation and Alpha will (i)
give the other party and its respective Representatives (and their counsel
and advisors) reasonable access (during regular business hours upon reasonable
notice), consistent with applicable Law, to all employees, offices and other
facilities and to all books, Contracts, commitments and records of it and
its Subsidiaries and cause it and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to provide access to its work papers and such other
information as the other party may reasonably request (subject, in the case of
work papers, to the execution of customary documentation reasonably requested
by auditors), and (ii) permit the other party to make such inspections of
Foundation Real Property or Alpha Real Property, as applicable, as the other
party may reasonably require ( _provided_  that no Phase II environmental
investigations or similar testing of ground soil shall be permitted to be
conducted), and (iii) cause its officers and those of its Subsidiaries to
furnish the other party with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of it and
its Subsidiaries as the other party may from time to time reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party and its respective Representatives
shall use all reasonable efforts to conduct any such investigation or
consultation in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business  



 

81  or operations of the other party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise interfere
with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal
duties. Each of Alpha and Foundation shall furnish promptly to the other a
copy of each report, schedule and other document filed by it or any of its
Subsidiaries during the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time
pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws, to the
extent not publicly available in the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC.

(b) Information obtained by a party pursuant to Section 5.7(a) shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms until the Effective Time, whereupon it shall terminate.

(c) Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall require a party to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
such party would (i) waive or jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
such party or its Subsidiaries or violate any of their respective contractual
obligations to any third party ( _provided_ that each such party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure), or (ii) result in a violation of applicable
Law, including the HSR Act. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7 or
otherwise shall affect the representations, warranties, or covenants in this
Agreement or any of the remedies or conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto.

Section 5.8 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Consents and Governmental
Approvals_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
last two sentences of this Section 5.8(a)), each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the last two
sentences of this Section 5.8(a), each of Foundation and Alpha agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, (i) obtain all waivers, consents and approvals from
parties to Contracts to which Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or to which Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, as applicable,
which are required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) obtain all consents, approvals, permits and authorizations that
are required to be obtained under any federal, state, local or foreign Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) prevent the
entry, enactment or promulgation of any injunction or order or Law that could
materially and adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to
consummate the transactions under this Agreement, (iv) lift or rescind any
injunction or order or Law that could materially and adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions under this
Agreement, and (v) in the event of any Proceeding or investigation relating
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby, cooperate to defend against
it and respond thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Alpha
need not  



 

82  agree to (including by consent under the next sentence) or make any
concessions or undertakings (including agreements to divest or hold separate
assets or limit lines of business) if such agreements, concessions or
undertakings either (x) would have a material and adverse effect on the
benefits Alpha reasonably expects to be derived from the combination of Alpha
and Foundation through the Merger or materially limit the conduct of business
by the Surviving Corporation, or (y) are not required to permit the
consummation of the Merger without material delay. Foundation shall not,
without the prior written consent of Alpha, agree to or make any concessions
or undertakings (including agreements to divest or hold separate assets or
limit lines of business) pursuant to this Section 5.8.

(b) Each of Foundation and Alpha agrees (i) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, to file all Notification and
Report Forms required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act, and (iii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent
with, and subject to, the other provisions of this Section 5.8 (including the
last two sentences of Section 5.8(a)), to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable, including by requesting early termination thereof. Each of Alpha
and Foundation shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.8(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law, use all commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (2) keep the other party reasonably
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, any Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (3) permit the other party
to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and
to the extent permitted by such applicable Governmental Entity or other
person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ "
means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other Laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.8(a) and (b), and subject to the last two sentences of
Section 5.8(a), if any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Alpha
and Foundation shall, subject to the other  



 

83  provisions of this Section 5.8 (including the last two sentences of Section
5.8(a)), use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable,
including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if
not resolved, would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger. Without limiting any of the other restrictions set
forth in this Agreement (including Section 5.1(c) and Section 5.2(c)), neither
party shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree
to acquire any business, Person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets or enter into any other transaction if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition or other transaction would be reasonably likely to materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or increase the
risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, approval or waiver from
a Governmental Entity charged with the enforcement of any Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Subject to Section 5.8(c) and the last two sentences of Section
5.8(a), in the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, Alpha and
Foundation shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously contest and
resist (by negotiation, litigation or otherwise) any such action or Proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously pursuing
all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For a period of at least six years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification
of the (as of or prior to the Effective Time) former directors, officers and
employees of Foundation than are currently provided in the Foundation
Certificate of Incorporation and the Foundation Bylaws, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the
expiration of the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters or
unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each (as of or prior to the Effective Time)
officer and director of Foundation or of any Subsidiary of Foundation (each,
together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and  



 

84  disbursements, incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of the fact that
the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or
agent of Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries, or of another entity if such
service was at the request of Foundation, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Surviving
Corporation is permitted to do so under applicable law and the Foundation
Certificate of Incorporation or Foundation Bylaws as at the date hereof. In
the event of any such proceeding, each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of the proceeding from the
Surviving Corporation to the same extent such Persons have the right to
advancement of expenses from Foundation as of the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the Foundation Certificate of Incorporation and Foundation Bylaws
( _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced shall have provided
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally determined that
such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

(c) Foundation shall purchase prior to the Effective Time, and, for a
period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain, a fully pre-paid six-year tail policy to the current
directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained on the date
of this Agreement by Foundation for an aggregate cost of no more than
$800,000 (exclusive of any premium refund on existing Foundation coverage),
which tail policy will cover a period from the Effective Time through and
including the date that is six years after the Closing Date with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain the same coverage and
amount as, and contain terms and conditions that are equivalent to the
coverage currently provided by the existing policies of Foundation (complete
and accurate copies of which shall have been made available to Alpha before
such purchase).

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Alpha shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.9 (i) shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and, from and after (but not before) the Effective Time, is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Indemnified Party and
(ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or
otherwise.

Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
honor, in accordance with their terms, all existing employment and severance
agreements between Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries and any officer,
director or employee of Foundation or any  



 

85  of its Subsidiaries and all other Foundation Plans, _provided_ that, subject
to the requirements of Section 5.10(b), this sentence shall not be construed
as a limitation on the right of the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any such Foundation Plans to the extent permitted by the terms of
the Foundation Plans.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, for the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the later to occur of (i) the first anniversary
thereof, and (ii) December 31, 2010, provide to each individual employed by
Foundation at the Effective Time, other than individuals covered by a
collective bargaining agreement (the " _Current Employees_ ") (other than
Current Employees who have entered into or will enter into at or prior to the
Effective Time an individual employment agreement with Foundation or any of
its Subsidiaries) compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation opportunities
and employee benefits provided by Foundation or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that nothing in this Section 5.10 shall interfere with the Surviving
Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to
conform with applicable Law or prevent the amendment or termination of
any Foundation Plan. Nothing in this Section 5.10 shall limit the right of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any Current Employee at any time.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall cause service rendered by Current
Employees of Foundation and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time to
be taken into account (for all purposes of eligibility and vesting) under
employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to
the same extent as such service was taken into account under
the corresponding Foundation Plans for those purposes. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 5.10(c) shall limit the right of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate existing Foundation Plans
or adopt new employee benefit plans. No Current Employee shall be subject to
any pre-existing condition limitation under any health plan of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which he or she would
have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Foundation Plan in
which he or she participated prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall give effect, for the fiscal year in
which the Effective Time occurs, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Current Employees prior to the Effective Time.

(d) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.10, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.10 or is intended to be an amendment to any Foundation Plan.

Section 5.11 _Takeover Laws_.

(a) Foundation shall, upon the request of Alpha, (i) take all necessary
steps to exclude the Merger and any other transaction contemplated hereby from
the applicability of any Takeover Laws, and (ii) assist in any challenge by
Alpha to the validity, or the applicability to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, of any Takeover Laws.



 

86 (b) Alpha shall, upon the request of Foundation, (i) take all necessary

prompt notice to Foundation, upon obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would make
the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1,

this Section 5.12 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter or otherwise limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to any party receiving such notice. This Section

requested by Alpha; (y) making its employees and other Representatives
(including accountants) reasonably available to Alpha to assist Alpha in
preparing a Consent Solicitation Statement of a form and type, and containing
such information, as is customary for consent solicitations that are
similar to the Consent Solicitation; _provided_ that Foundations accountants
shall not be required to provide any comfort letter with respect to such
Consent Solicitation Statement; and (z) if required by DTC, facilitating the
eligibility of the Consent Solicitation for DTCs ATOP System.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Foundation and Alpha acknowledge and
agree that nothing in this Agreement shall (i) require Foundation or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Affiliates to (x) enter into or execute any certificate or other document in

by Alpha in connection with (A) any supplemental indenture implementing the
Indenture Amendments described in the Consent Solicitation Statement; 
_provided_ that any such supplemental indenture shall not become operative
prior to consummation of the Merger and Foundation shall have received
evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that the conditions to signing such
supplemental indenture (including that the requisite consents under the
Indenture shall have been received) have been properly satisfied or waived
(the " _Supplemental Indenture_ ") or (B) any legal opinion required by the
Indenture or requested by the Trustee to be delivered by counsel to Alpha or

Alpha are also required by the Trustee and in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Foundation)), or (z) obtain any rating agency confirmations or
approvals; (ii) require counsel to Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries to
deliver any legal opinion in connection with the Consent Solicitation, unless
the Trustee requires counsel to Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries to

of a legal opinion from Alpha or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) require
Foundation or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, counsel or advisors, to make any representation or
warranty, incur any liability or provide for any indemnification or expense
reimbursement in connection with the Consent Solicitation (other than as

(c) Alpha hereby agrees and acknowledges that its obligation to effect
the Merger on the Closing Date in accordance with Section 1.2 is not
contingent or conditioned on obtaining or closing upon the Financing Facility
or receiving any disbursement thereunder and that no breach, other than a
willful and material breach, by Foundation of, or other failure, other than a

to time be prescribed by the Board of Directors signed by, or in the name of
the Corporation by, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or
an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, certifying
the number and class of shares of stock in the Corporation owned by him. Any

stockholder entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the
transaction upon the Corporations books. Upon the receipt of proper transfer
instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated shares, such
uncertificated shares shall be cancelled, the issuance of new equivalent
uncertificated shares or certificated shares shall be made to the stockholder
entitled thereto and the transaction shall be recorded upon the books of
the Corporation. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral
security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the
transfer if, when the certificates are presented or transfer instructions are
given with respect to uncertificated shares, both the transferor and

power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem
necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares
of stock of the Corporation.

the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the Board of Directors may direct, in
order to indemnify the Corporation against any claims that may be made
against it in connection therewith. A new certificate of stock may be issued

become mutilated without the posting by the owner of any bond upon the
surrender by such owner of such mutilated certificate.



 

B-10 SECTION 5.04 _List of Stockholders Entitled To Vote_. The stock ledger
shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine

its surplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with Delaware General
Corporation Law § 154 and § 244 or (b) in case there shall be no such
surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is
declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Before the declaration of any
dividend, the Board of Directors may set apart, out of any funds of the
Corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as from time to time in
their discretion may be deemed proper for working capital or as a reserve fund
to meet contingencies or for such other purposes as shall be deemed conducive
to the interests of the Corporation.

SECTION 5.06 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.
To determine the stockholders of record, the board of directors may fix a
record date, provided that the record date shall not precede the date upon
which the board adopts the resolution fixing the record date and provided
further that the record date shall be: (a) in the case of determination of
stockholders entitled to receive notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or adjournment thereof, not more than sixty nor less than ten
(10) days before the date of such meeting; provided that if no record date is
fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is
given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (b) in the case of
determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting, in accordance with Section 2.08; and (c) in the
case of any other action, not more than sixty (60) days prior to such other
action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the board may choose to fix a new record date
for the adjourned meeting.

SECTION 5.07 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to the
Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares of stock
with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares or the giving of
transfer instructions with respect to uncertificated shares, the Corporation
may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends,
to vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights
and powers of an owner. The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part
of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
thereof.

effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by

SECTION 6.02 _Waiver of Notice_. A written waiver of any notice, signed

timeliness of notice.

ARTICLE VII

Indemnification

SECTION 7.01 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he is
or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an
"indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer or trustee, or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith,
if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that, (i)
except as provided in Section 7.03 of these Bylaws with respect to proceedings
to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any
such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board of Directors and (ii) the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Corporation has
consented to such settlement.

SECTION 7.02 _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the
right to indemnification conferred in Section 7.01 of these Bylaws, an
indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation
the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending  



 

B-12  any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an
"advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General
Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee
in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including,
without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only
upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication")
that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this Section 7.02 or otherwise.

SECTION 7.03 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under
Section 7.01 or 7.02 of these Bylaws is not paid in full by the Corporation
within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in
a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and
(b) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to
recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not
met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware
General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that identification
of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General
Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its
directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden
of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

SECTION 7.04 _Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification_.
Any indemnification to be provided under Section 7.01 or 7.02 of these
Restated Bylaws (unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction) shall be
made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination that the indemnification is proper under the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
such paragraph. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who
is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority
vote of the Board of Directors who are not  



 

B-13  parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum,
or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of
such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such
directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders.

SECTION 7.05 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification
and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation as amended
from time to time, Bylaws as amended from time to time, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

SECTION 7.06 _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

SECTION 7.07 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation_.
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

SECTION 7.08 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees
in this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as
to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall
inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.
Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects
any right of an indemnitee or it successors shall be prospective only and
shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.
