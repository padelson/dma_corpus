\- vii - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 4, 2015 (this "Agreement"),
between F.N.B. CORPORATION, a Florida corporation ("FNB"), and METRO BANCORP,
INC., a Pennsylvania corporation ("MBI").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of MBI and FNB have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders, and,
in the case of MBI, its other constituencies as set forth in Section 1715 of
the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, as amended (the "PBCL"), to
consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in
this Agreement pursuant to which MBI will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into FNB (the
"Merger"), so that FNB is the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Company"); and

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax (as defined in Section 3.10(b)) purposes, it
is intended that (i) the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the regulations of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury promulgated thereunder (as such regulations may be amended from time
to time, including corresponding provisions of successor rules and regulations
thereto, the "Treasury Regulations"), (ii) FNB and MBI each be a party to
the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code (clauses
(i) and (ii), the "Intended Tax Treatment"), and (iii) this Agreement be and
is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Entity Transactions Law, as amended (the "ETL") and the Florida
Business Corporation Act, as amended (the "FBCA"), at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.2) MBI shall merge with and into FNB. FNB shall be
the Surviving Company in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of MBI shall cease.

 



\- 1 - 1.2 _Effective Time_.

 

The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the statement of merger and
the articles of merger (each, the "Articles of Merger") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the
Secretary of State of the State of Florida, respectively, on or before the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1). The term "Effective Time" shall
mean the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the
Articles of Merger. "Effective Date" shall mean the date on which the
Effective Time occurs.

 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Effects Under ETL and FBCA_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 336 of the ETL and Sections
607.1106 and 607.11101 of the FBCA.

(b) _Directors and Executive Officers of the Surviving Company_. The
directors of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be (i)
the directors of FNB immediately prior to the Merger, and (ii) one current
member of MBIs Board of Directors as mutually agreed by FNB and MBI (the
"MBI Designee"). The MBI Designee will have a term expiring at the first
annual meeting of FNB shareholders following the Effective Time. The executive
officers of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be the
executive officers of FNB immediately prior to the Merger.

1.4 _Conversion of MBI Common Shares_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each common share, par value
$1.00 per share, of MBI ("MBI Common Shares") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Treasury Shares (as
defined in Section 1.4(b)) shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer be
outstanding and shall as of the Effective Time automatically be converted into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive as consideration in the
Merger 2.373 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, $0.01 par value,
of FNB ("FNB Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration").

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Treasury Share shall be cancelled
and retired and no shares of FNB Common Stock or other consideration shall be
issued in exchange therefor. "Treasury Shares" means the MBI Common Shares
held by MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) or
by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in a fiduciary, including
custodial or agency, capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted in
good faith.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of MBI shall be closed as
to holders of MBI Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time and no
transfer of MBI Common Shares by any such holder shall thereafter be made or
recognized. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing MBI
Common Shares ("Certificates;" it being understood that any reference herein
to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include reference to MBI Common Shares
held in book entry) are properly presented pursuant to Section 2.2(a) of this
Agreement to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.1), such Certificates
shall be cancelled and exchanged for FNB Common Stock held in book entry
representing the number of 

 



\- 2 -  whole shares into which the MBI Common Shares represented by the
Certificates was converted in the Merger, plus, if applicable pursuant to
Section 1.4(e), any payment for any fractional share of FNB Common Stock
without any interest thereon and any dividends or distributions to which the
holder of such Certificates is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b).

 

(d) Each holder of MBI Common Shares shall have the option of enrolling the
whole shares of FNB Common Stock issuable to such shareholder upon the
consummation of the Merger in FNBs Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock
Purchase Plan (the "DRSP Plan"), as long as such shareholder enrolls with a
minimum of 50 whole shares of FNB Common Stock. Each MBI shareholder
electing to enroll in the DRSP Plan shall be issued FNB Common Stock held in
book entry representing the number of whole shares received in the Merger.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of MBI
Common Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share
of FNB Common Stock, after taking into account all MBI Common Shares owned by
such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall receive an
amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (a) the Average Closing Price (as defined
below) as of the Closing Date by (b) the fraction of a share (calculated to
the nearest ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of FNB Common
Stock, to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall
be entitled to dividends or other rights in respect of any such fractional
shares. "Average Closing Price" means, as of any specified date, the average
composite closing price of FNB Common Stock as reported by the NYSE for each
of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth
such trading day prior to the specified date rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth.

 

1.5 _FNB Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of FNB
capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.6 _MBI Stock Options_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to purchase MBI Common Shares (each, a "MBI Stock Option")
pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans identified on Section 3.2(a)
of the MBI Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Article 3 hereof) (the "MBI
Stock Plans") and the award agreements evidencing the grants thereunder,
granted to any current or former employee or director of MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(d)) shall at the Effective Time cease
to represent a right to acquire MBI Common Shares and shall be converted
automatically into an option to acquire shares of FNB Common Stock on the
terms hereinafter set forth. FNB shall assume each such MBI Stock Option
in accordance with the terms of the relevant MBI Stock Plan and stock option
or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the
Effective Time: (i) FNB and the Compensation Committee of its Board of
Directors, including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of FNB,
shall be substituted for MBI and the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of MBI, including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of
MBI, administering such MBI Stock Plan, (ii) each MBI Stock Option assumed by
FNB may be exercised solely for shares of FNB Common Stock, (iii) the number
of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to such MBI Stock Option shall be equal
to the number of MBI Common Shares subject to such MBI Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that, unless otherwise provided for in such MBI

 



\- 3 -  Stock Option, any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the
exercise price per share of FNB Common Stock under each such option shall be
the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the per share
exercise price under each such MBI Stock Option prior to the Effective Time
divided by the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the
preceding sentence, each MBI Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option"
shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification,
extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the
Code. FNB and MBI agree to take all reasonable and necessary steps to effect
the provisions of this Section 1.6. As of the Effective Time, FNB shall issue
to each holder of each outstanding MBI Stock Option that has been assumed by
FNB a document evidencing the conversion and assumption of such MBI Stock
Option by FNB pursuant to this Section 1.6.

 

1.7 _Treatment of MBI ESPP_. The right to acquire MBI Common Shares under the
SmartBuy Stock Purchase Plan (the "MBI ESPP") is not a MBI Stock Option for
purposes of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, MBI shall take all
actions that are necessary to provide that with respect to the MBI ESPP: (a)
the monthly purchase period under the MBI ESPP in progress as of the
Effective Time (the "Final Purchase Period") shall be deemed to end no later
than the tenth (10th) business day prior to the Effective Time; (b) each MBI
ESPP participants accumulated contributions under the MBI ESPP shall be used
to purchase MBI Common Shares in accordance with the terms of the MBI ESPP as
of the end of the Final Purchase Period and, to the extent not so used to
purchase MBI Common Stock, shall be refunded to the MBI ESPP participants;
and (c) the MBI ESPP shall terminate immediately following the conclusion of
the Final Purchase Period. At the Effective Time, each MBI Common Share
purchased under the MBI ESPP (each, a "MBI ESPP Share") shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4 of this
Agreement.

1.8 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. The FNB
Charter (as defined in Section 4.1(b)) as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. The FNB Bylaws
(as defined in Section 4.1(b)) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 

1.9 _Dissenting Shares_. No right to fair value or appraisal or similar rights
shall be available to holders of MBI Common Shares with respect to the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

1.10 _The Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, MBI and FNB shall cause Metro Bank, a state-chartered bank
headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania ("Metro Bank"), and First National
Bank of Pennsylvania, a federally chartered national bank headquartered
in Greenville, Pennsylvania ("FNB Bank"), respectively, to enter into a bank
merger agreement, the form of which is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit
"A" (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), and which provides for the merger of Metro
Bank with and into FNB Bank, with FNB Bank being the surviving entity (the
"Bank Merger"), in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of the Bank
Merger Agreement, to become effective as soon as 

 



\- 4 -  practicable after the Effective Time. FNB and MBI shall cause the following
to be accomplished prior to filing applications for the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals: (i)(A) MBI shall obtain approval from the Board of Directors of
Metro Bank for the Bank Merger Agreement, (B) MBI, as sole shareholder of
Metro Bank, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and (C) MBI shall cause
the Bank Merger Agreement to be duly executed by Metro Bank and delivered to
FNB; and (ii)(A) FNB shall obtain approval from the Board of Directors of FNB
Bank for the Bank Merger Agreement, (B) FNB, as sole shareholder of FNB Bank,
shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and (C) FNB shall cause the Bank
Merger Agreement to be duly executed by FNB Bank and delivered to MBI. Prior
to the Effective Time, MBI shall cause Metro Bank, and FNB shall cause FNB
Bank, to execute such articles of merger and such other documents
and certificates as are necessary or desirable to make the Bank Merger
effective (the "Bank Merger Certificates") immediately following the Effective
Time.

 

1.11 _Right to Revise Structure_. FNB may at any time change the method of
effecting the combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent
it deems such a change to be desirable; provided, however, that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration (as
defined in Section 1.4(a)) provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely
affect the Tax treatment for MBIs shareholders as a result of receiving the
Merger Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this
Agreement, or (iii) be reasonably likely to materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates. In the event FNB
elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

 

ARTICLE 2

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

2.1 _FNB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, FNB shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with Registrar and Transfer Company, as exchange agent
("Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, (i) book entry
shares representing the aggregate number of shares of FNB Common Stock
issuable pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for the MBI Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (ii)
immediately available funds sufficient in amount to pay (x) any dividends or
distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(i) and (y) cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 1.4(e) and paid pursuant to Section 1.4 in exchange for outstanding
MBI Common Shares (such immediately available funds and book entry shares of
FNB Common Stock, collectively being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by FNB, _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates.

 

2.2 _Exchange Shares_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of MBI Common Shares a letter of transmittal in customary
form as prepared by FNB and reasonably

 



\- 5 -  acceptable to MBI, which shall specify, among other things, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the
MBI Common Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). After the
Effective Time of the Merger, each holder of a Certificate
formerly representing MBI Common Shares, other than Treasury Shares, who
surrenders or has surrendered such Certificate or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificate,
together with duly executed transmittal materials to the Exchange Agent,
shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to: (i) book entry shares
representing FNB Common Stock into which the MBI Common Shares shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 1.4, (ii) any cash in lieu of any fractional
share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled and
(iii) any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.2(b). The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificate upon
compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate representing MBI Common Shares shall be deemed from and after
the Effective Time of the Merger to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which
the MBI Common Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). FNB
shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares and/or any declared but unpaid dividends to which any
former holder of MBI Common Shares is entitled as a result of the Merger until
such holder surrenders his Certificate or Certificates for exchange as
provided in this Section 2.2. If any shares of FNB Common Stock, or any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and/or declared but unpaid dividends, are to be
issued in a name other than that in which a Certificate surrendered for
exchange is issued, the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the
Certificate surrendered or provide funds for their purchase or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of
an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to FNB, of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by FNB or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such amount as FNB and the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, FNB or
the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the whole shares of FNB Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any dividends or distributions, if any, with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that have been declared by MBI in respect of MBI Common Shares
after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) at the time
of such surrender, the amount of

 



\- 6 -  any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of FNB Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(e) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the
Merger and which had become payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB
Common Stock prior to the time of surrender, and (iii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record
date after the Effective Time of the Merger but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares
of FNB Common Stock.

 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of MBI of the MBI Common Shares that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of MBI Common Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to FNB for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. All
shares of FNB Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common
Stock and/or declared but unpaid dividends issued or paid upon the surrender
for exchange of MBI Common Shares (or the provision of customary affidavits
and indemnification for lost or mutilated Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof) and the letter of transmittal, shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such MBI Common
Shares.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund, including any interest thereon, that
remains undistributed to the shareholders of MBI following the passage of
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered
to FNB, upon demand, and any shareholders of MBI who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to FNB for payment
of their claim for FNB Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
FNB Common Stock and any unpaid dividends or distributions payable in
accordance with Section 2.2(b).

 

(e) Neither MBI nor FNB shall be liable to any holder of MBI Common Shares or
FNB Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares, any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

(f) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock held by it from time
to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of FNB
Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.

 

2.3 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, (a) FNB shall declare a stock dividend or distribution on
FNB Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine FNB Common Stock, or make a
distribution other than a regular quarterly cash dividend, on FNB Common
Stock or on any security convertible into FNB Common Stock, in each case with
a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or (b) the
outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities in each case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar 

 



\- 7 -  change in FNBs capitalization, then a proportionate adjustment or
adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio and, as applicable, the Average
Closing Price to give holders of MBI Common Shares the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, which adjustment may
include, as appropriate, the issuance of securities, property or cash on the
same basis as that on which any of the foregoing shall have been issued,
distributed or paid to holders of such class of FNB Common Stock generally.

2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent or, subsequent to the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, FNB, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock, cash
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and any other
cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of MBI
Common Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of MBI Common Shares in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or FNB,
as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MBI

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by MBI to FNB prior
to the execution of this Agreement (the "MBI Disclosure Schedule"), MBI
hereby represents and warrants to FNB as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) MBI is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. MBI has the corporate
power and authority and has all licenses, permits and authorizations of
applicable Governmental Entities (as defined in Section 3.4) required to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where such failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in
Section 3.1(d)) upon MBI. MBI is duly registered as a bank holding company
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). MBI
is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
"Federal Reserve Board").

 

(b) True and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of MBI (the "MBI
Articles") and the bylaws of MBI (the "MBI Bylaw"), each as amended,
supplemented, restated and/or otherwise modified and in effect as of the date
of this Agreement, have previously been made available to FNB.

 



\- 8 - (c) Metro Bank is a state-chartered bank and is regulated by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and the Pennsylvania Department of
Banking and Securities ("Pa DOB"). Metro Bank is duly organized, and validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and has the requisite power and authority, corporate or
otherwise, to own its property and carry on its business as presently
conducted, but is not qualified to do business in any other jurisdiction or
required to be qualified to do business in any other jurisdiction except
where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on MBI. The deposit accounts of Metro Bank are insured by the FDIC through the
Federal Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and
all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have
been paid when due. Metro Bank is a member in good standing of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and owns the requisite amount of stock therein.
Each of MBIs other Subsidiaries (i) was duly organized, (ii) is validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business in, and in
good standing under the laws of, all jurisdictions, whether federal, state,
local or foreign, where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified, and (iv) has all requisite
corporate power and authority, and has all licenses, permits and
authorizations of applicable Governmental Entities required to own or lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for purposes of clause (iii) only, as would not be reasonably likely
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
MBI. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of
each Subsidiary of MBI, copies of which have been made available to FNB, are
true and correct copies of such documents as amended, supplemented, restated
and/or otherwise modified and in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) As used in this Agreement, (i) the word "Subsidiary" when used with
respect to either party, means any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company or any other entity (A) of which such party, or a
subsidiary of such party, is a general partner, or (B) at least a majority of
the securities or other interests of which having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or persons
performing similar functions with respect to such entity is directly or
indirectly owned by such party and/or one or more Subsidiaries thereof, and
the terms "MBI Subsidiaries" and "FNB Subsidiaries" shall mean any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of MBI or FNB, respectively; and (ii) the term "Material
Adverse Effect" means, with respect to FNB, MBI or the Surviving Company, as
the case may be, any event, circumstance, development, change or effect that
alone or in the aggregate with other events, circumstances, developments,
changes or effects, (A) is materially adverse to the business, results
of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole; provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (A), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include effects to the extent resulting
from (1) changes, after the date of this Agreement, in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") or regulatory accounting requirements
applicable to banks or savings associations and their holding companies
generally, (2) changes, after the date of this Agreement, in Laws of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or any Governmental Entity,
(3) actions or omissions of (x) FNB or (y) MBI, in each case, taken at the
request of, or with the prior written consent of, the other or required
hereunder, (4) changes, events or developments, after the date of this
Agreement, in the national or world economy or financial or securities markets
generally, or changes, events or developments, after the date of this
Agreement, in general economic

 



\- 9 -  conditions or other changes, events or developments, after the date of this
Agreement that affect banks or savings associations or their holding companies
generally, except to the extent that such changes have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on such party relative to other similarly
situated participants in the markets or industries in which they operate, (5)
consummation or public disclosure of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, including the resignation of employment of employees or any
impact on such partys business, customer relations, condition or results of
operations, in each case as a result therefrom, (6) any outbreak or
escalation of war or hostilities, any occurrence or threats of terrorist acts
or any armed hostilities associated therewith and any national or
international calamity, disaster or emergency or any escalation thereof, (7)
any changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates, (8) any claim, suit,
action, audit, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or other proceeding or
order which in any manner challenges, seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or
delay, or seeks damages as a result of or in connection with, the
transactions this Agreement contemplates, (9) any failure by such party to
meet any published, whether by such party or a third party research analyst,
or internally prepared estimates of revenues or earnings, (10) a decline in
the price, or a change in the trading volume of, such partys common stock on
The NASDAQ Stock Market (including any successor exchange, "NASDAQ"), or the
New York Stock Exchange (including any successor exchange, the "NYSE"), as
applicable, and (11) any matter to the extent that (x) it is disclosed in
reasonable detail in the partys disclosure schedules delivered to the other
party pursuant to this Agreement or in the MBI Reports or FNB Reports
referenced in Section 3.6 or Section 4.6, as applicable, and (y) such
disclosed matter does not worsen in a materially adverse manner, or (B)
materially delays or impairs the ability of such party to timely consummate
the transactions this Agreement contemplates.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of MBI consists of (i) 25,000,000 MBI Common
Shares, of which, as of June 30, 2015, 14,014,550 shares were issued and

1,050,000 have been approved for issuance by MBI shareholders and reserved on
the books of MBI but are not yet registered with the SEC) reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of MBI Stock Options pursuant to the MBI Stock
Plans and for purchase under the MBI ESPP and the Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan (the "MBI DRIP") (of which 1,130,670 shares were subject
to outstanding MBI Stock Options, and 508,267 shares were reserved for

to acquire MBI Common Shares under the MBI ESPP and the MBI DRIP will be,
when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except pursuant to
this Agreement, the MBI Stock Plans, the MBI ESPP, and the MBI DRIP, MBI does
not have, and is not bound by, any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any MBI

 



\- 10 -  Common Shares or any other equity securities of MBI, or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any MBI Common Shares.
Set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the MBI Disclosure Schedule is a true, correct
and complete list of: (1) each MBI Stock Option (such list to identify the MBI
Stock Plan or other arrangement under which such options were issued, the
number of MBI Common Shares subject thereto, the vesting schedule thereof and
the exercise prices thereof), and (2) the number of MBI Common Shares
available for purchase under each of the MBI ESPP and the MBI DRIP as of June
30, 2015. Since June 30, 2015 through the date hereof, MBI has not issued or
awarded, or authorized the issuance or award of, any options, restricted stock
units or other equity-based awards under the MBI Stock Plans (other than
ordinary course elections to invest in MBI Common Shares under the MBI
ESPP and the MBI DRIP), or otherwise. As of the date of this Agreement, no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any
matters on which shareholders of MBI may vote are issued or outstanding.

 

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
ownership interests of each Subsidiary of MBI are owned by MBI, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of any material liens, pledges, charges and
security interests and similar encumbrances, other than liens for property
Taxes not yet due and payable ("Liens"), and all of such shares or
equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No such Subsidiary
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) MBI has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates,

Section 1.10, no corporate approvals on the part of MBI or Metro Bank are
necessary to approve the Bank Merger Agreement or consummate the Bank Merger.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by MBI and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
FNB, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of MBI, enforceable against
MBI in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,

of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies.

 



\- 11 - (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by MBI nor the
consummation by MBI of the transactions this Agreement contemplates, nor
compliance by MBI with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will
(i) violate any provision of the MBI Articles or the MBI Bylaws or, (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.4
are duly obtained and/or made and are in full force and effect, (A) violate
any law, statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ,

MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which MBI or any of the
MBI Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or

either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MBI.

\- 12 -  No event has occurred, nor has any circumstance arisen, that, to the
knowledge of MBI, would reasonably be likely, either individually or together
with any other event or circumstance, to impair the ability to obtain or
materially delay the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals on a timely
basis or result in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition.

 

3.5 _Reports_. MBI and each of the MBI Subsidiaries have in all material
respects timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were

statements required to be filed by them since December 31, 2012, including any
report or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or
regulations of the United States, any state, any local government, any

of the MBI Subsidiaries.

 

3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) MBI and each MBI Subsidiary has filed or furnished on a timely basis to
the SEC, all material forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by it to the SEC under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or under
the securities regulations of the SEC since December 31, 2012 (all such filed
or furnished documents, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and
all information incorporated therein by reference, the "MBI Reports"). As of
their respective filing dates (and, in the case of registration statements
and proxy statements, as of the dates of effectiveness and the dates of
mailing, respectively), except to the extent that any MBI Report has been
amended by a subsequently filed MBI Report prior to the date hereof, in which
case, as of the date of such amendment, (i) the MBI Reports complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"),
as the case may be, and (ii) none of the MBI Reports contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of
MBIs Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes thereto) included
(or incorporated by reference) in the MBI Reports comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published

basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of MBI and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their respective consolidated results of operations, changes in shareholders
equity and changes in cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring adjustments that were
not, or are not expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with
GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.

SEC staff with respect to the MBI Reports.

are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of MBI or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the
system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence.
MBI and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls effective to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. MBI (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) effective to ensure that material information relating to MBI,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of MBI by others within those entities
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to the MBI Reports
and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
of this Agreement, to MBIs outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of MBI (A) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect MBIs ability to
accurately record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in MBIs internal control over financial
reporting.

 

(e) Since December 31, 2012, (A) neither MBI nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the knowledge of MBI, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of MBI or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of MBI or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that MBI or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (B) no attorney representing MBI or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by MBI or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material 

 



\- 14 -  violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by MBI or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the MBI Board
of Directors or any committee thereof or to any of MBIs directors or
officers.

(f) No agreement pursuant to which any loans or other assets have been or
shall be sold by MBI or the MBI Subsidiaries entitle the buyer of such loans
or other assets, unless there is a material breach of a representation or
covenant by MBI or the MBI Subsidiaries, to cause MBI or the MBI Subsidiaries
to repurchase such loan or other assets or the buyer to pursue any other form
of recourse against MBI or the MBI Subsidiaries, and there has been no
material breach by MBI or the MBI Subsidiaries of a representation or covenant
in any such agreement. The MBI Reports have disclosed, since December 31,
2014, any cash, stock or other dividend or any other distribution with respect
to the capital stock of MBI that has been declared, set aside or paid.

 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Except for Sandler ONeill + Partners, L.P., neither MBI
nor any MBI Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related
transactions this Agreement contemplates.

 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2014, (i) MBI
and the MBI Subsidiaries have, except in connection with the negotiation and
execution and delivery of this Agreement, carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and (ii) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to MBI.

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) There is no pending, or, to MBIs knowledge, threatened, litigation,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or arbitration by any individual,
partnership, corporation, trust, joint venture, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity (each, a "Person") relating to MBI, any of the MBI
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or permits, licenses
or authorizations that has had, or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on MBI.

(b) There is no judgment or order of any Governmental Entity or regulatory
restriction, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated financial or bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries, that has
been imposed upon MBI, any of the MBI Subsidiaries or the assets of MBI or
any of the MBI Subsidiaries, that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on MBI.

3.10  _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

(a) Each of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed, including
all applicable extensions, all income and other material Tax Returns (as
defined in subsection (c) below) required to be filed by it on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in
all material respects, has timely paid or withheld and timely remitted all
Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly and timely paid or withheld and
timely remitted all Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, that are
due and payable or claimed to be due from it by a Governmental Entity, other
than Taxes that (i) are not yet

 



\- 15 -  delinquent or are being contested in good faith, which have not been finally
determined, and (ii) have been adequately reserved against in accordance with
GAAP. All required estimated Tax payments sufficient to avoid any
underpayment penalties or interest have been made by or on behalf of each of
MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries. Neither MBI nor any of the MBI Subsidiaries has
granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period for the assessment
or collection of Tax that remains in effect. There are no disputes, audits,
examinations or proceedings in progress or pending, including any notice
received of any intent to conduct an audit or examination, or claims asserted,
for Taxes upon MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries. No claim has been made by
a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries has not filed Tax Returns such that MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. All
deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any examinations by
any Governmental Entity of the Tax Returns of, or including, MBI or any of the
MBI Subsidiaries have been fully paid. No issue has been raised by a
Governmental Entity in any prior examination or audit of each of MBI and the
MBI Subsidiaries which, by application of the same or similar principles,
could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency in respect of
such Governmental Entity for any subsequent taxable period. There are no
Liens for Taxes, other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable,
upon any of the assets of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries. Neither MBI nor
any of the MBI Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement, other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among MBI and the MBI
Subsidiaries. Neither MBI nor any of the MBI Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return,
other than a group the common parent of which was MBI, or (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person, other than MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries, under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6, or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law, or as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise. Neither MBI nor any of the MBI Subsidiaries has been, within the
past two years or otherwise as part of a "plan" or series of related
transactions, within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code, of which the
Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation", within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code, in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code. No MBI Common Shares are owned by a Subsidiary
of MBI. MBI is not and has not been a "United States real property holding
corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Neither
MBI, nor any of the MBI Subsidiaries or any other Person on their behalf has
executed or entered into any written agreement with, or obtained or applied
for any written consents or written clearances or any other Tax rulings from,
nor has there been any written agreement executed or entered into on behalf
of any of them with any Governmental Entity, relating to Taxes, including any
private letter rulings of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or
comparable rulings of any Governmental Entity and closing agreements pursuant
to Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any
similar provision of any applicable Law, which rulings or agreements would
have a continuing effect after the Effective Time. Neither MBI nor any of the
MBI Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction that is the same as or
substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that the IRS has
determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by notice,
regulation or other form of published guidance as a "listed transaction", as
set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b)(2). MBI has made available to FNB
complete copies of (i) all federal, state, local and foreign income or
franchise Tax Returns 

 



\- 16 - of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries relating to all taxable periods beginning on
and after January 1, 2011, and (ii) any audit report issued within the last
three years relating to any Taxes due from or with respect to MBI or the MBI
Subsidiaries. Neither MBI, any of the MBI Subsidiaries nor FNB, as a successor
to MBI, will be required to include any item of material income in, or
exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable
period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i)
change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing Date or (iv) deferred intercompany gain or any excess loss account of

Law or otherwise.

 

(c) As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax Return" means any return,
declaration, report, claim for refund, or information return or statement

of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

"MBI Benefit Plan" means any employee benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, practice, or other arrangement providing benefits to any current or

contributes or is obligated to contribute, whether or not written, including
any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the MBI Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list of
all MBI Benefit Plans and all MBI Employment Agreements. 

(b) With respect to each MBI Benefit Plan, MBI has delivered or made available
to FNB, as applicable, a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing
constituting a part of such MBI Benefit Plan, including all plan documents,
trust agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, (ii) the
two most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules,
if any, (iii) the current summary plan description and any summaries of
material modifications, (iv) the most recent annual financial report, if any,

delivered or made available to FNB a true, correct and complete copy of each
MBI Employment Agreement.

(c) All contributions required to be made to any MBI Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any MBI
Benefit Plan, for any period prior to and through the date of this Agreement,
have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be
made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been fully
reflected on the financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. Each MBI
Benefit Plan that is an

 



\- 18 -  employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is
funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit
fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded.

(d) With respect to each MBI Benefit Plan, MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries
have complied, and are in compliance, in all material respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such
MBI Benefit Plans, including Code Section 409A. Each MBI Benefit Plan has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There are
not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely to
give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to any
MBI Benefit Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets of MBI
or any of the MBI Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section 3.11(d) of the
MBI Disclosure Schedule identifies each MBI Benefit Plan that is intended to
be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the
"MBI Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter
with respect to each MBI Qualified Plan and the related trust which has not
been revoked, or MBI is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the
IRS. To the knowledge of MBI, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any MBI Qualified Plan or the related trust. None of MBI
and the MBI Subsidiaries nor, to MBIs knowledge, any other Person, including
any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction", as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would reasonably be
likely to subject MBI, any of the MBI Subsidiaries or any Person that MBI or
any of the MBI Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material
Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA.

(e) With respect to each MBI Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not
exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and (ii) (A) the fair
market value of the assets of such MBI Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the
actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such MBI Benefit Plan,
whether or not vested, on a termination basis, (B) no reportable event within
the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived has occurred, (C) all premiums, if any, to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in
full, (D) no liability, other than for premiums to the PBGC, under Title IV
of ERISA has been or would reasonably be likely to be incurred by MBI or any
of the MBI Subsidiaries and (E) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such MBI Benefit Plan and, to MBIs knowledge, no condition
exists that makes it reasonably likely that such proceedings will be
instituted or which would reasonably be likely to constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee
to administer, any such MBI Benefit Plan.

(f) (i) No MBI Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"), (ii)
none of MBI and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
has, at any time contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan and (iii) none of MBI and the MBI
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now
exist, nor do any

 



\- 19 -  circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that
arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the MBI Benefit Plans or MBI
Employment Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither MBI nor any of the MBI Subsidiaries, nor, to MBIs knowledge, any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 

(g) MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical
or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to
MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will,
either alone or in conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or
otherwise, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor
of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of
any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to
any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
or compensation including deferred compensation, or (iv) result in any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be
subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax
under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) MBI has delivered or made available to FNB a true and complete list of
the names, corporate and functional titles, hire dates, incentive
compensation, profit sharing and bonuses paid in 2013 and 2014 and 2015 bonus
opportunities, full or part-time status, 2015 annual salaries or hourly
rates of all employees of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries ("MBI
Employees") as of the date hereof and, with respect to any MBI Employee on a
leave of absence or otherwise not actively employed ("Inactive MBI
Employees"), the date on which each such Inactive MBI Employee is expected to
return to active employment. Except as otherwise set forth on Section 3.11(i)
of the MBI Disclosure Schedule, (A) none of the MBI Employees has a contract
of employment with MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries, (B) all MBI Employees
are employees "at will" whose employment is terminable without liability
therefor and (C) none of the MBI Employees has a contract with MBI or any of
the MBI Subsidiaries relating to stay bonuses, retention or stay payments,
severance pay or benefits or other perquisites or benefits.

(j) No labor organization or group of employees of MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and

with (i) the execution and delivery by FNB of this Agreement and (ii) the
consummation by FNB of the Merger and the other transactions this Agreement

to the knowledge of FNB, would reasonably be likely, either individually or
together with any other event or circumstance, to impair the ability to obtain
or materially delay the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals on a
timely basis or result in the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition.

4.5 _Reports_. FNB and each of its Subsidiaries have in all material respects
timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required

and schedules thereto and all information incorporated therein by reference,

registration statements and proxy statements, as of the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of mailing, respectively), except to the extent that any FNB
Report has been amended by a subsequently filed FNB Report prior to the date

complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, and (ii) none of the FNB Reports contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated

electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of FNB or its

required by the Exchange Act with respect to the FNB Reports and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to FNBs outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of FNB (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect FNBs ability to accurately record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in FNBs internal control over financial reporting.

 

(e) Since December 31, 2012, (A) neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the knowledge of FNB, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant

had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing

Board of Directors of FNB or any committee thereof or to any of FNBs
directors or officers.

respect to FNB.

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 

(a) There is no pending, or, to FNBs knowledge, threatened, litigation,

its Subsidiaries that has had or is reasonably likely to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB.

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of FNB and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed, including all applicable extensions, all income or other

payable or claimed to be due from it by a Governmental Entity, other than
Taxes that (i) are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith,
which have not been finally determined, and (ii) have been adequately reserved
against in accordance with GAAP. All required estimated Tax payments
sufficient to avoid any underpayment penalties or interest have been made by
or on behalf of each of FNB and its Subsidiaries. Neither FNB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period for
the assessment or collection of Tax that remains in effect. There are no
disputes, audits, examinations or proceedings in progress or pending,
including any notice received of any intent to conduct an audit or
examination, or claims asserted, for Taxes upon FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries. No claim has been made by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has not filed Tax Returns
such that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. All deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result
of any examinations by any Governmental Entity of the Tax Returns of, or
including, FNB or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully paid. No issue has
been raised by a Governmental Entity in any prior examination or audit of
each of FNB and its Subsidiaries which, by application of the same or similar
principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed deficiency in
respect of such Governmental Entity for any subsequent taxable period. There
are no Liens for Taxes, other than statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable, upon any of the assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither FNB
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing,

Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Section 4.10 of the FNB Disclosure
Schedules, neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return, other than a
group the common parent of which was FNB, or (B) has any liability for the
Taxes of any Person, other than FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, under Treas.
Reg. § 1.1502-6, or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, or
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither FNB nor any of
its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or otherwise as part of
a "plan (or series of related transactions)", within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code, of which the Merger is also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation", within the meaning

Common Stock is owned by a Subsidiary of FNB. FNB is not and has not been a
"United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified
in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Neither FNB, its Subsidiaries nor

into on behalf of any of them with any Governmental Entity, relating to
Taxes, including any IRS private letter rulings or comparable rulings of any
Governmental Entity and closing agreements pursuant to Section 7121 of the
Code or any predecessor provision thereof or any similar provision of any
applicable Law, which rulings or agreements would have a continuing effect
after the Effective Time. Neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
in any transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of
the types of transactions that the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance
transaction and identified by notice, regulation or other form of published
guidance as a "listed transaction," as set forth in Treas. Reg. §
1.6011-4(b)(2). FNB has made available to MBI complete copies of (i) all
federal, state, local and foreign income or franchise Tax Returns of FNB and
its Subsidiaries relating to the taxable periods beginning on and after
January 1, 2011, and (ii) any audit report issued within the last three years

4.11 _Employee Benefits_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

"FNB Benefit Plan" means any employee benefit or compensation plan, program,
policy, practice, or other arrangement providing benefits to any current or
former employee, officer or director of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof that is sponsored or maintained by FNB or any
of its Subsidiaries or to which FNB or any of its Subsidiaries contributes or
is obligated to contribute, whether or not written, including any employee
welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee
pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, whether or
not such plan is subject to ERISA, and any bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, equity compensation,
severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan, program or
policy. 

"FNB Employment Agreement" means a contract, offer letter or agreement of FNB
or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any individual who is
rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee pursuant to which
FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent liability or
obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in consideration for
past, present or future services.

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list of
all FNB Benefit Plans and all FNB Employment Agreements.

 



\- 35 - (b) With respect to each FNB Benefit Plan, FNB made available to MBI a true,
correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing constituting a part of such
FNB Benefit Plan, including all plan documents, trust agreements, and
insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, (ii) the two most recent
Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any, (iii)
the current summary plan description and any summaries of material
modifications, (iv) the most recent annual financial report for each
applicable FNB Benefit Plan, if any, (v) the most recent actuarial report, if
any, (vi) the most recent determination or opinion letter from the IRS, if
any, and (vii) the most recent minimum coverage and discrimination testing
results, if any. FNB has made available to MBI a true, correct and complete
copy of each FNB Employment Agreement.

(c) All contributions required to be made to any FNB Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any FNB
Benefit Plan, for the period six (6) years prior to and through the date of
this Agreement, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been
fully reflected on the financial statements to the extent required by GAAP.
Each FNB Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section
3(1) of ERISA either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and
is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code
or (ii) is unfunded.

 

(d) With respect to each FNB Benefit Plan, FNB and its Subsidiaries have
complied, and are in compliance, in all material respects, with
all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to
such FNB Benefit Plans, including Code Section 409A. Each FNB Benefit Plan has
been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. There
are not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely
to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a
FNB Benefit Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the assets of FNB
or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section 4.11(d) of the
FNB Disclosure Schedule identifies each FNB Benefit Plan that is intended to
be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("FNB
Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each FNB Qualified Plan and the related trust which has not been
revoked, or FNB is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS.
To the knowledge of FNB, there are no existing circumstances and no events
have occurred that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any FNB Qualified Plan or the related trust. To the
knowledge of FNB, none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any other Person,
including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction", as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would
reasonably be likely to subject FNB, any of its Subsidiaries or any Person
that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

 

(e) No FNB Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code has failed to satisfy the minimum funding
standards contained in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code. With
respect to such FNB Benefit Plans, except as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) the fair market value of the
assets of such FNB Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value
of all accrued benefits under such FNB Benefit Plan, whether or not

 



\- 36 -  vested, on a termination basis, (ii) no reportable event within the meaning
of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not
been waived has occurred, (iii) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely
paid in full, (iv) no liability, other than for premiums to the PBGC, under
Title IV of ERISA has been or would reasonably be likely to be incurred by FNB
or any of its Subsidiaries and (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such FNB Benefit Plan and, to FNBs knowledge, no condition
exists that makes it reasonably likely that such proceedings will be
instituted or which would reasonably be likely to constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee
to administer, any such FNB Benefit Plan.

 

(f) (i) No FNB Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan, (ii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan
and (iii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability
that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any
circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that
arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the FNB Benefit Plans or the FNB
Employment Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to FNBs knowledge, any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 

(g) Other than as set forth in Section 4.11(g) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule,
FNB and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to FNB
and its Subsidiaries.

(h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or otherwise,
(i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to
be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of FNB or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or
compensation, including deferred compensation, or (iv) result in any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be
subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax
under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) No labor organization or group of employees of FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and
there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or, to FNBs knowledge,
threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board.
Each of FNB and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all applicable
Laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours and
occupational safety and health.

 



\- 37 - 4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. FNB and each of its Subsidiaries hold
all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses under, and have complied in all
material respects with, all Laws applicable to FNB or any of its Subsidiaries,
including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot)
Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, Regulation O and applicable limits on loans to one
borrower, except where such failure to hold or such noncompliance is not
reasonably likely to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB. FNB and each of the FNB Subsidiaries have been and are
in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

4.13  _Contracts_. Except for matters that have not had and would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FNB, (a) none of FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries is, with or
without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, in breach or
default in any material respect under any material contract, lease, license or
other agreement or instrument, (b) to the knowledge of FNB, none of the other
parties to any such material contract, lease, license or other agreement or
instrument (excluding instruments or agreements relating to Loans) is, with or
without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, in breach or
default in any material respect thereunder and (c) neither FNB nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the intention of any party to
terminate or cancel any such material contract, lease, license or other
agreement or instrument, whether as a termination or cancellation for
convenience or for default of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.14 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither FNB nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or action
issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since December 31,
2012, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since December 31, 2012,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its

Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading. Each of MBI and FNB further agrees that
if such party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any
information furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements in
the Registration

 



\- 48 -  Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform
the other party thereof and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and, to the extent
required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of MBI.

 

(c) FNB agrees to advise MBI, promptly after FNB receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualification of FNB Common Stock for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent FNB is aware thereof,
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

 

(d) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly (but in any case, within sixty (60) days
of the date of this Agreement) prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities. MBI
and FNB shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to MBI or FNB, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party, Regulatory Agency or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this Agreement
contemplates and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
FNB and MBI shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid the
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require FNB or MBI
to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of Regulatory Agencies or Governmental Entities
that would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on FNB, the
Surviving Company or MBI, as the case may be, after giving effect to
the Merger, after the Effective Time (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition"). In addition, MBI agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to assist FNB in preparing and filing such petitions and filings, and
in obtaining such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third
parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities, that may be necessary
or advisable to effect any mergers and/or consolidations of Subsidiaries of
MBI and FNB following consummation of the Merger.

 



\- 49 - (e) Each of FNB and MBI shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of FNB, MBI or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Agency or Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Each of FNB and MBI shall promptly provide each other with any written
communications received from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
promptly advise the other upon receiving any oral communication with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any Regulatory Agency
or Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation
of the transactions this Agreement contemplates.

(g) MBI and FNB shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statements without the prior
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party, but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances, issue such press release or make such public statements as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the OCC, the NYSE
or NASDAQ. In addition, the Chief Executive Officers of MBI and FNB shall be
permitted to respond to appropriate questions about the Merger from the
press. MBI and FNB shall cooperate to develop all public announcement
materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related
to the Merger as reasonably requested by the other party.

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of MBI and FNB shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, reasonable
access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and,
during such period, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request. MBI shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
provide to FNB a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state banking laws other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Law. Neither MBI nor FNB nor any of
their Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would be likely to jeopardize or
prejudice the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product protection of
such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement, including Laws relating to confidential
supervisory information. The parties shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply to the extent possible in light of those
restrictions.

 



\- 50 - (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements entered into
between MBI and FNB (the "Confidentiality Agreements").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

 

6.3 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 

(a) MBI shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite MBI Vote (the "MBI Shareholders Meeting"), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective.
Subject to Section 6.11(b), MBI shall (i) through the Board of Directors of
MBI, recommend that the shareholders of MBI approve and adopt this Agreement,
and approve the Merger and the other transactions this Agreement contemplates,
(ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement (the "MBI
Recommendation"), and (iii) subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of MBI, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
shareholders a vote approving and adopting the Merger and this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, MBIs obligations pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 6.3 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to MBI of
any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.11(e)(i)) or by any change
in MBI Recommendation.

(b) FNB shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite FNB Vote (the "FNB Shareholders Meeting"), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective.
FNB shall recommend that the shareholders of FNB approve the issuance of FNB
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from its shareholders a vote approving such issuance in accordance
with Section 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. FNB
shall adjourn or postpone the FNB Shareholders Meeting if, as of the time for
which such meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of FNB Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting FNB has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the Requisite FNB Vote. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the FNB Shareholders Meeting shall be convened and the
issuance of FNB Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of FNB at the FNB Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of
voting on such issuance, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve FNB of such obligation.

 

(c) MBI and FNB shall cooperate to schedule and convene the MBI Shareholders
Meeting and the FNB Shareholders Meeting on the same date.

 



\- 51 - 6.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of MBI and FNB agrees
to exercise good faith and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and
to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates as promptly as
possible.

 

6.5 _NYSE Approval_. FNB shall cause the shares of FNB Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, FNB
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of MBI and the
MBI Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each FNB Benefit Plan of
general applicability with the exception of FNBs defined benefit pension plan
and any other plan frozen to new participants (collectively, the "FNB
Eligible Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of FNB
and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that inclusion of the employees of
MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries in the FNB Eligible Plans may occur at different
times with respect to different plans, provided that coverage shall be
continued under corresponding MBI Benefit Plans until such employees are
permitted to participate in the FNB Eligible Plans and provided further,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require FNB or any of
its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of MBI under any
discretionary equity compensation plan of FNB or to provide the same level of
(or any) employer contributions or other benefit subsidies as MBI or the MBI
Subsidiaries have provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof,
FNB or its Subsidiaries shall provide severance payments and benefits to
each employee of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than
the more favorable of the severance payments and benefits (x) set forth on
Section 6.6(a) of the MBI Disclosure Schedule and (y) provided by FNB and
its Subsidiaries to their similarly situated employees

(b) FNB shall cause each FNB Eligible Plan in which employees of MBI and the
MBI Subsidiaries are eligible to participate, to recognize, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in, and vesting of, benefits under the
FNB Eligible Plans, the service of such employees with MBI and the MBI
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by MBI or the MBI Subsidiaries, and, solely for purposes of FNBs vacation
programs, for purposes of determining the benefit amount, provided, however,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. Except for the commitment to
continue those MBI Benefit Plans that correspond to FNB Eligible Plans until
employees of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries are included in such FNB Eligible
Plans, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of FNB to amend or
terminate any of the MBI Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the extent
permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such terms.

 

(c) At and following the Effective Time, and except as otherwise provided in
this Section 6.6, FNB shall honor, and the Surviving Company shall continue
to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit
obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of MBI
and the MBI Subsidiaries and current and former directors 

 



\- 52 -  of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date under any
MBI Benefit Plan. Any years of service recognized for purposes of this Section
6.6(c) will be taken into account under the terms of any generally applicable
severance policy of FNB or its Subsidiaries.

(d) At such time as employees of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries become eligible
to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of FNB or its Subsidiaries,
FNB shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and available from its
insurers, cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable
medical, health or dental plans of FNB, (ii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise
be applicable to such employee or dependent on or after the Effective Time to
the extent such employee or dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous MBI Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time,
and (iii) provide each such employee of MBI and the MBI Subsidiaries and his
or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under an MBI Benefit Plan (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous MBI Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any medical,
dental or health plan of FNB or its Subsidiaries.

(e) MBI shall adopt such Board resolutions and take such other action as
FNB may reasonably request at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective
Time to cause the 401(k) Plan to be amended to freeze the employer stock fund
and to be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Plan
Termination Date") and the accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in
the 401(k) Plan as of the Plan Termination Date to become fully vested as of
the Plan Termination Date. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
but in no event later than six (6) months after the Plan Termination Date,
FNB shall file or cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a
determination letter that the termination of the 401(k) Plan as of the Plan
Termination Date will not adversely affect the plans qualified status. FNB
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination
letter; including adopting such amendments to the 401(k) Plan as may be
requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable
determination letter. As soon as practicable following the receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified status of
the 401(k) Plan upon its termination, the account balances in the 401(k) Plan
shall be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to an
eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as a
participant or beneficiary may direct. The Surviving Company shall take all
other actions necessary to complete the termination of the 401(k) Plan,
including filing a Final Form 5500, that arise after the Effective Time. FNB
agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to permit 401(k) Plan
participants who become employees of FNB or its Subsidiaries to roll over
their account balances in the 401(k) Plan and loans from the 401(k) Plan to
the F.N.B. Corporation Progress Savings 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding anything
in Section 6.6(a) to the contrary, employees of MBI or any MBI Subsidiary who
continue in employment with the Surviving Company following the Effective Time
shall be eligible as of the Effective Time to participate in the F.N.B.
Corporation Progress Savings 401(k) Plan.

 

(f) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, MBI shall, at the written request
of FNB, freeze or terminate each other MBI Benefit Plan as requested by FNB.

 



\- 53 - (g) MBI shall take such action, and provide any required notices, as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any Person presently serving as a trustee
or administrator to any MBI Benefit Plan to be removed effective as of the
Effective Time and to appoint FNB, First National Trust Company, or such other
FNB Subsidiary or committee as FNB shall specify, to serve as successor
trustee or administrator to such removed individual trustees or administrators
effective as of the Effective Time.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular MBI Benefit Plan; (ii) prevent FNB, MBI or any of
their successors or Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any MBI employee who remains employed with MBI or any of the MBI
Subsidiaries; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any
employee of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any MBI employee by
FNB, MBI or any of their successors or Affiliates or under any benefit plan
which FNB, MBI or any of their successors or Affiliates may maintain.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") in
which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at
the request of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (the "Indemnified
Parties"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that
he is or was a director or officer of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries or
was serving at the request of the MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another Person or
(ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions this Agreement contemplates,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against such Claim and
respond thereto. From and after the Effective Time, FNB shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Company to, (A) indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent currently provided under applicable Law, the MBI Articles and
the MBI Bylaws, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, including reimbursement for reasonable
fees and expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel, and
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual Claim and (B) advance expenses as incurred (including in
advance of the final disposition of any Claim) by such Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; provided that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable
and customary form) if required by applicable Law to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

 

(b) FNB and the Surviving Company agree that all rights to indemnification of
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, and all limitations with
respect thereto, existing in favor of any Indemnified Person, as provided
under Section 6.7(a), shall survive the

 



\- 54 -  Merger and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment
thereto; provided, however, that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under the PBCL, the MBI Articles or the MBI Bylaws, as the case may
be, shall be made by independent legal counsel, whose fees and expenses shall
be paid by FNB and the Surviving Company, selected by such Indemnified Party
and reasonably acceptable to FNB; and, provided further that nothing in this
Section 6.7 shall impair any rights or obligations of any current or former
director or officer of MBI or its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the
respective organizational documents of MBI, or its Subsidiaries, under the
PBCL or otherwise.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, FNB shall obtain at the expense of MBI, and
FNB shall maintain for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
policies covering the Indemnified Parties who as of the Effective Time are
covered by MBIs directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, provided that these policies must be of at least the same
coverage amounts and contain coverage terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policies of MBI. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time from an insurer or insurers
selected by FNB that have an insurer financial strength rating by A.M. Best
Co. of at least "A", which policies provide the Indemnified Parties with
coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, including in respect of the transactions this Agreement contemplates, on
terms that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than MBIs
directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary liability insurance
policies existing immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. If such
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, then FNB
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue the
obligations thereunder. However, in no event shall FNB be required to expend
for any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently
paid by MBI for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided
that if FNB is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 6.7(c) as a result of the preceding provision, FNB shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain policies containing coverage
amounts, terms and conditions that are the most advantageous as is available
for the maximum Insurance Amount.

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Company, or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into
any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its
assets or deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction,
then in each case, the Surviving Company will cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company will
expressly assume the obligations of the Surviving Company set forth in this
Section 6.7.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, including any merger between a Subsidiary of FNB, on the one hand,
and a Subsidiary of MBI, on the other hand, or to vest the Surviving Company
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, 

 



\- 55 -  immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers
and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole
expense of, FNB.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of FNB and MBI shall promptly advise the other
of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, or remedies with respect
thereto, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; provided, further, that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9
shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to
be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach
would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article
VII to be satisfied.

6.10  _Dividends_. Except for regular dividends paid at the quarterly rate in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, after the date of this Agreement, MBI
shall not declare or pay any dividend in respect of shares of MBI Common
Shares, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.10, after the date of this Agreement MBI shall coordinate the
declarations of any dividends in respect of the MBI Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto with FNBs declaration of
regular quarterly dividends on FNB Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of MBI and FNB that
holders of MBI Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to
receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of MBI
Common Stock and any shares of FNB Common Stock such holders receive in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

6.11 _Certain Actions_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, except as
otherwise permitted by this Section 6.11, MBI will not, and will not
authorize or permit any of its directors, officers, agents, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents, Affiliates or
representatives (collectively, "MBI Representatives") to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or take any action to
facilitate, including by way of furnishing information, any Acquisition
Proposal, as defined in Section 6.11(e)(i), or any inquiries with respect to
or the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in
any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to MBI
or any of the MBI Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of MBI or any of the MBI Subsidiaries, to otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by any third party that is seeking to make, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) except in accordance with Section 8.1(h),
approve, endorse or recommend or enter into any letter of intent or similar
document or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise
relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, MBI and its
Board of Directors shall be permitted: (i) to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal provided that the Board of Directors of MBI shall not withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to FNB the MBI 

 



\- 56 -  Recommendation except as set forth in subsection (iii) below, (ii) to engage
in any discussions or negotiations with, and provide any information to, any
third party in response to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal by any such third
party, if (x) MBIs Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the
information then available after consultation with outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors that failure to do so
would result in a breach of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (y) prior to
providing any information or data to any third party in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal by any such third party, MBIs Board of Directors
receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement, which
confidentiality terms shall be no less favorable to MBI than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreements between MBI and FNB, a copy of which
executed confidentiality agreement shall have been provided to FNB for
informational purposes, and (z) at least 48 hours prior to providing any
information or data to any third party or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any third party, MBI promptly notifies FNB in writing of the
name of such third party and the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) to withdraw, modify, qualify in a manner
adverse to FNB, condition or refuse to make the MBI Recommendation (the
"Change in MBI Recommendation") if MBIs Board of Directors concludes in good
faith, based on the information then available after consultation with
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, that failure to do so would result in a breach their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Change in MBI
Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of MBI
at the MBI Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of
this Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve MBI of
such obligation; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors of MBI
shall have effected a Change in MBI Recommendation, then the Board of
Directors of MBI may submit this Agreement to MBIs shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded), in which event the Board of Directors of
MBI may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to MBIs
shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment
or supplement thereto to the extent required by applicable Law. In addition
to the foregoing, MBI shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 

(c) MBI will promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify FNB in writing
of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any information related
thereto, which notification shall describe the Acquisition Proposal and
identify the third party making the same.

(d) MBI agrees that it will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the MBI Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this
Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. MBI or its Representatives shall promptly after the date
of this Agreement instruct each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal with or for the
benefit of MBI to promptly return or destroy all information, documents and
materials relating to an Acquisition Proposal or to MBI or its businesses,
operations or affairs heretofore furnished by MBI or any of its
Representatives to such Person or any of such Persons Representatives in
accordance with the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such Person,
and to destroy all summaries, analyses or extracts of or based upon such
information in the possession of such Person or any of such Persons
Representatives.

 



\- 57 - (e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer,
filing of any regulatory application or notice, whether in draft or final
form, or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing by or from any
Person relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes 20% or more of the total revenues, net income or

opinions described in Sections 7.2(d) and 7.3(d), including by causing its
officers to execute and deliver Tax Representation Letters to the law firms
delivering such Tax opinions at such time or times as may reasonably be
requested by such law firms. FNB and MBI shall each use its reasonable best
efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be
untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which inaction
would cause to be untrue) any of the representations included in
the certificates described in this Section 6.13.

6.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, FNB and MBI shall take all
steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions
contemplated by Article 1 and any other dispositions of equity securities of

the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of FNB and FNB
Bank shall be increased by one and the MBI Designee shall be appointed as a
director of FNB and FNB Bank. FNB will nominate the MBI Designee for election
as a director at the annual meeting of FNB immediately following the
Effective Time and solicit proxies for the MBI Designee in the same manner as
it does for all the other members of FNBs slate of directors in connection
with such meeting.

nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction

Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and

Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The MBI Disclosure Schedule and the FNB
Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other schedules and all exhibits to this
Agreement, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any
reference to this Agreement. Any matter disclosed pursuant to any section
of either Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of any
other section of the Disclosure Schedule, to the extent that applicability of
the disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item in either Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by either party that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, or that any breach or violation of applicable
laws or any contract exists or has actually occurred. This Agreement shall not
be interpreted or construed to require any person to take any action, or fail
to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. In this
Agreement, "knowledge" means the actual knowledge as of the date referenced of
executive officers of the applicable party following reasonable inquiry of
persons within their organization and its Subsidiaries who would be reasonably

authorized by law or executive order to be closed, (ii) the term "made
available" means any document or other information that was (a) provided by
one party or its representatives to the other party or its representatives
prior to the date hereof or (b) included in the virtual data room of a party
prior to the date hereof, (iii) references to "the date hereof" shall mean
the date of this Agreement, (iv) the word "or" is not exclusive, and (v) terms
defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and
vice versa.

into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto
or thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts, including by
facsimile or other electronic means, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature
to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense
to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such
defense.

 

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreements.

9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Merger and all claims arising hereunder or relating to
this Agreement, shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Pennsylvania state court or the United States District Court for the Western
District of Pennsylvania, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that,
subject to rights with respect to post-trial motions and rights of appeal or
other avenues of review, a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the parties to this
Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement in any Pennsylvania state court or the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Each of the
parties to this Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT

 



\- 70 -  SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.8.

(d) Each party agrees that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties
obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties further waives (i)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision that, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties, whether by operation of law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7(d), this
Agreement, including the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement, is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than
the parties to this Agreement any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT

August  , 2015

F.N.B. Corporation

One F.N.B. Boulevard

Hermitage, PA 16148

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

Concurrently with the execution of this letter agreement (" _Voting Agreement_
"), F.N.B. Corporation, a Florida corporation (" _FNB_ "), and Metro Bancorp,
Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (" _Metro_ "), are entering into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger, of even date herewith (the " _Merger Agreement_ "),
whereby Metro will merge with and into FNB (the " _Merger_ ") and
shareholders of Metro will receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in
the Merger Agreement, subject to the closing of the Merger. All defined terms
used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Merger Agreement.

A condition to FNBs obligations under the Merger Agreement is that I
execute and deliver this Voting Agreement to FNB.

Intending to be legally bound hereby, I irrevocably agree and represent as
follows:

 

(a) As of the date of this Voting Agreement, I have, and at all times during
the term of this Voting Agreement will have, beneficial ownership (as defined
in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, and good and valid title to, the
number of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Metro (the "
_Metro Common Stock_ "), that is set forth on _Appendix A_ hereto, and I
hold stock options to acquire the number of shares of Metro Common Stock set
forth on _Appendix A_ hereto. All of the securities listed on _Appendix A_
are owned free and clear of any proxy or voting restriction, claims, liens,
encumbrances and security interests and any other limitation or restriction
whatsoever (including any restriction on the right to dispose of such
securities). None of the securities listed on _Appendix A_ is subject to
any voting trust or other agreement or arrangement with respect to the voting
rights of such securities.

(b) As of the date of this Voting Agreement, except for the securities set
forth on _Appendix A_ , I do not beneficially own any (i) shares of capital
stock or voting securities of Metro, (ii) securities of Metro convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of Metro or
(iii) options or other rights to acquire from Metro any shares of capital
stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock or voting securities of Metro. The Metro Common Stock listed on
_Appendix A_ , together with all Metro Common Stock that I subsequently
acquire during the term of this Voting Agreement, including through the
exercise of any stock options, warrants or similar instruments, are referred
to herein as the " _Shares_ ".

(c) At the Metro Shareholders Meeting and at any other meeting of Metro
shareholders, however called, and on every action or approval by written
consent of shareholders of Metro, I will vote or cause to be voted all Shares
over which I have sole voting power, and I will use my best efforts to cause
any Shares over which I share voting power to be voted in favor of (i)
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the
Merger Agreement. Determinations as to "sole" or "shared" voting power shall
be made in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

 

(d) During the term of this Voting Agreement, I will not, directly or
indirectly, offer, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of
(collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any Shares over which I have sole dispositive
power (or any interest therein), and I will use my best efforts to not permit
the Transfer of any Shares over which I have shared dispositive power (or
any interest therein), except to the extent permitted by paragraph (g)
hereof.

(e) I agree that Metro shall not be bound by any attempted sale of any Metro
Common Stock over which I have sole voting and dispositive power, and Metros
transfer agent shall be given appropriate stop transfer orders and shall not
be required to register any such attempted sale, unless the sale has been
effected in compliance with the terms of this Voting Agreement.

 



B-1 (f) I represent that I have the legal capacity to enter into this Voting
Agreement, that I have duly and validly executed and delivered this Voting
Agreement and that this Voting Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
enforceable against me in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency and other laws affecting creditors rights and general equitable
principles; and further, that no consent of my spouse is necessary under any
"community property" or other laws in order for me to enter into and perform
my obligations under this Voting Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, I may Transfer any or all
of the Shares over which I have beneficial ownership to my spouse, ancestors
or descendants; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, prior to and
as a condition to the effectiveness of such Transfer, each person to which any
of such Shares or any interest in any of such Shares is or may be Transferred
shall have executed and delivered to FNB an agreement to be bound by the terms
of this Voting Agreement.

 

I am signing this Voting Agreement solely in my capacity as a shareholder of
Metro and as an option holder, if I am such, and not in any other capacity,
such as a director or officer of Metro or as a fiduciary of any trusts in
which I am not a beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
(a) I make no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity other than in
my capacity as a beneficial owner of Metro Common Stock and (b) nothing
herein shall be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by me or
any of my representatives, as applicable, in serving on Metros Board of
Directors or as an officer of Metro, in acting in my capacity as a director,
officer or fiduciary of Metro.

This Voting Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
concurrently with, and automatically upon, the earlier to occur of (a) the
favorable vote of the Metro shareholders with respect to the approval of the
Merger Agreement, (b) the Effective Time, (c) FNB and I enter into a written
agreement to terminate this Voting Agreement, or (d) any termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, except that any such
termination shall be without prejudice to FNBs rights if termination should
arise out of my willful breach of any covenant or representation contained
herein.

All notices and other communications in connection with this Voting Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, sent
via facsimile, with confirmation, mailed by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, or delivered by an express courier, with
confirmation, to the other party hereto at its addresses set forth on the
signature page hereto.

This Voting Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. This Voting Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Voting Agreement.

I agree and acknowledge that FNB may be irreparably harmed by, and that there
may be no adequate remedy at law for, any violation of this Voting Agreement
by me. Without limiting other remedies, FNB shall have the right to seek to
enforce this Voting Agreement by specific performance or injunctive relief.
This Voting Agreement and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto,
shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof. I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any Pennsylvania state court or the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this letter.

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Voting Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Voting Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall

 



B-2  negotiate in good faith to modify this Voting Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

This Voting Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile
transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto
in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.
