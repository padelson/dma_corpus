 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have (a)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and Merger Sub,
respectively, and their respective stockholders, and declared it advisable, to
enter into this Agreement, (b) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (c) resolved to recommend

WHEREAS, the general partner of Parent has (a) determined that it is in the
best interests of Parent and its unitholders, and declared it advisable, to

performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Unit Issuance (as defined
herein) and (c) approved the adoption of the Fourth Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership of Parent (the " _Fourth Amended Partnership
Agreement_ ") in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto, effective as of the Closing
(as defined herein);

 



 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with, and as a condition to, the execution hereof,
certain stockholders of the Company are executing a support agreement with
Parent, dated as of the date hereof, in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto (the "
_Support Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, such

(the " _Code_ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I.**

 



 

 ** _THE MERGER_**

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue its corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Locke Lord Bissell and Liddell, 600 Travis Street, Suite
2800, Houston, Texas at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be agreed upon by
the parties in writing (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the
third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by action taken at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at
such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in
writing.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed
in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such later time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL
(such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

 



 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided
under the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation._

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof
and applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.6. _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

 



 

Section 1.7. _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 ** _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.1(b) and
Section 2.1(d), each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the
Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ "),
other than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares, shall thereupon be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive one (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully-paid (to the
extent required under the Fourth Amended Partnership Agreement) and
nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Revised
Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the " _Delaware LP Act_ ")) Series B Unit
(each, a " _Series B Unit_" and, collectively, the " _Series B Units_")
having the rights, preferences and privileges set forth in the Fourth Amended
Partnership Agreement (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time,
each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any cash in lieu of fractional Series B Units payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), all
to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(b).

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Share that is held directly or indirectly
by the Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (in each case, other than any Shares held on behalf of
third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
for such cancellation and retirement.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully-
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) _Fractional Units_. No fractional Series B Units shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fractional Series B Unit will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), a cash payment in
lieu of such fractional Series B Unit representing such holderÂ’s proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced
by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more
transactions of Series B Units equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate number
of Series B Units to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) over (B) the aggregate number of whole Series B Units to be
distributed to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (such excess,
the " _Excess Shares_ "). No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Series B Units shall be issued in the Merger. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Shares converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
Series B Unit (after taking into account all Shares exchanged by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional amount multiplied by the "Series B Liquidation Value" of the
Series B Units as defined in the Fourth Amended Partnership Agreement (the "
_Conversion Price_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Series B Units was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Series B Units. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional Series B Units, the Exchange
Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Shares, without
interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.2.

 



 

(e) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Exchange Ratio,
the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be
equitably adjusted to provide to Parent, Merger Sub and the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such action, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the
"Exchange Ratio," "Merger Consideration" and any other similarly dependent
items shall be references to the Exchange Ratio, Merger Consideration and any
other similarly dependent items as so adjusted; _provided, however_ , that
nothing in this Section 2.1(e) shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right to appraisal, such holderÂ’s Shares shall thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal
shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and
Merger Sub (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid
the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL,
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent which will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, voluntarily make or agree to make any material payment
with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company,
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Shares._

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for Merger Consideration. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares
(other than the Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares), certificates
representing the Series B Units issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and
Section 5.6(a) (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by
Parent if uncertificated Series B Units will be issued). Following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c). All certificates representing Series B Units (including the
amount of any distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.2(c) and cash in lieu of fractional Series B Units to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(d)) are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth business day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and that risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for certificates
representing whole Series B Units (or appropriate alternative arrangements
shall be made by Parent if uncertificated Series B Units will be issued), cash
in lieu of any fractional Series B Units pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon

 



      
 

 



 

surrender of Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor that number of whole Series B Units (after taking
into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, payment by cash or check in lieu of
fractional Series B Units which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and
the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a person other than
the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share is registered, it
shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Share be
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery of
the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a
result of such registration in the name of a person other than the registered
holder of such Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or
Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c).

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No distributions with
respect to Series B Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share with respect to the Series B
Units represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Series B
Units shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(d), until such
Share has been surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Share, there shall be paid to
the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender,
the number of whole Series B Units issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to
this Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Series
B Unit to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and the
amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Series B Units and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole Series B Units. The Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under
this Agreement to any holder of Shares, such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local
Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All Series B Units issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid)
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously
represented by such Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock

 



       
 

 



 

transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional Series B Units pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any distributions
pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (excluding any disclosures
set forth in any "risk factor" section and in any section relating to forward-
looking statements, to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), where the relevance of the information as an
exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or in the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or
covenant if specified therein and such other representations, warranties or

jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, to carry on
its business as presently conducted and to perform its material obligations
under all Company Material Contracts. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As used in this Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means a
material adverse event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence
on or with respect to the business, financial condition or continuing results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than any event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence: (i)
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date of
this Agreement (excluding any disclosure set forth in any risk factor section,

disclosures therein, in each case, to the extent that they are cautionary and
predictive or forward looking in nature) or as disclosed on the face of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) in or generally affecting the economy or the
financial or securities markets in the United States or elsewhere in the world
or (iii) resulting from or arising out of (A) any changes or developments in
national, regional, state or local wholesale or retail markets for natural
gas, natural gas transmission or distribution, or related products or services
including those due to actions by competitors or due to changes in commodities
prices or hedging markets therefor, (B) any changes or developments in
national, regional, state or local wholesale or retail natural gas prices, (C)

Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (D)
any taking of any action at the written request of Parent or Merger Sub, (E)
any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification,
reinterpretation or proposal of any rule, regulation, ordinance, order,
protocol or any other Law of or by any national, regional, state or local
Governmental Entity, or market administrator, (F) any changes in GAAP or
accounting standards or interpretations thereof, (G) any weather-related or
other force majeure event or outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of
war or terrorism, or (H) any changes in the share price or trading volume of
the Shares or in the CompanyÂ’s credit rating, or the failure of the Company to
meet projections or forecasts (unless due to any event, change, effect,
development, condition or occurrence which has otherwise resulted in a Company
Material Adverse Effect); _except_ , in each case with respect to subclauses
(A) Â— (B) and (E) Â— (G) of this clause (iii), to the extent materially and
disproportionately affecting the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to other similarly situated companies in the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

Organizational Documents_ "), and promptly upon request, the Company will make
available to Parent the certificate of incorporation, certificate of limited
partnership, certificate of formation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement,
limited liability company agreement or comparable constituent or

each Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any Liens other than Company

this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of

have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company
and, except for the Company Stockholder Approval (assuming Parent is not an

the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously resolved to recommend

other equitable remedies and general principles of equity, regardless of

time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or

Section 3.4. _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since
January 1, 2009 (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company
SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that information set forth in the Company SEC Documents
as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be deemed to
modify information as of an earlier date.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

 



 

Section 3.5. _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
CompanyÂ’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"). The CompanyÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2010 and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of the
Company has disclosed to the CompanyÂ’s auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the CompanyÂ’s
ability to report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting, and each such
deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.

 



 

Section 3.6. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in the CompanyÂ’s consolidated balance sheets (or the notes thereto)
included in the Company SEC Documents, (b) as permitted or contemplated by
this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred since December
31, 2010 **** in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and (d) for liabilities or obligations that have been discharged or paid in
full in the ordinary course of business, as of the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liabilities or obligations
of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other
than those which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.7. _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and are not in
default under or in violation of any applicable federal, state, local or
foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree or agency requirement of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2008, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to
the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, other communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure to comply with, any
Law, except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications and
registrations and orders of all Governmental Entities, and all rights under
any Company Material Contract with all Governmental Entities, and have filed
all tariffs, reports, notices, and other documents with all Government
Entities necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses as they
are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure
to have any of the Company Permits would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are valid
and in full force and effect and are not subject to any administrative or
judicial proceeding that could result in modification, termination or
revocation thereof, except where the failure to be in full force and effect or
any modification, termination or revocation thereof would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, in compliance in all respects
with the terms and requirements of such Company Permits, except where the
failure to be in compliance would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.8. _Environmental Laws and Regulations_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect: (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for information,
citation, summons, complaint or order has been received, no penalty has been
assessed, and no investigation, action, claim, suit, proceeding or review is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened by any Governmental
Entity or other person relating to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company or against any person or entity whose liability the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either contractually or
by operation of law, and relating to or arising out of any Environmental Law,
(ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are, and except for matters that have
been fully resolved with the applicable Governmental Entity, since January 1,
2008 have been in compliance with all Environmental Laws (which compliance

assets and properties are currently used and operated, and each such Right-of-

Liens); (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct their businesses in a
manner that does not violate any of the Rights-of-Way; (iii) the Company and
its Subsidiaries have fulfilled and performed all of their obligations with
respect to such Rights-of-Way; and (iv) the Company has not received written
notice of the occurrence of any ongoing event or circumstance that allows, or

limitation, revocation or termination of any Right-of-Way or would result in
any impairment of the rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries in and to any
such Rights-of-Way. All pipelines operated by the Company and its Subsidiaries
are subject to Rights-of-Way, and there are no gaps (including any gap arising
as a result of any breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of the
terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the Rights-of-Way other than gaps that would

of the foregoing) that neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation

forth in any "risk factor" section and in any section relating to forward-
looking statements, and any other disclosures therein, in each case to the
extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature),
where the relevance of the information as an exception to (or disclosure for
purposes of) a particular representation is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure, or in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation, warranty or covenant if specified therein and such

and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, to carry on
its business as presently conducted and to perform its material obligations
under all Parent Material Contracts. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is
qualified to do business, and is in good standing as a foreign entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As used in this Agreement, a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means a
material adverse event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence
on or with respect to the business, financial condition or continuing results
of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any
event, change, effect, development, condition or occurrence: (i) disclosed in
the Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date of this
Agreement (excluding any disclosure set forth in any risk factor section, or
in any Section relating to forward looking statements, and any other
disclosures therein, in each case, to the extent that they are cautionary and
predictive or forward looking in nature) or as disclosed on the face of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (ii) in or generally affecting the economy or the
financial or securities markets in the United States or elsewhere in the
world, or (iii) resulting from or arising out of (A) any changes or
developments in national, regional, state or local wholesale or retail markets
for natural gas, natural gas transmission or distribution or related products
or services including those due to actions by competitors or due to changes in
commodities prices or hedging markets therefor, (B) any changes or
developments in national, regional, state or local wholesale or retail natural

market administrator, (F) any changes in GAAP or accounting standards or
interpretations thereof, (G) any weather-related or other force majeure event
or outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of war or terrorism, or (H)

ParentÂ’s credit rating, or the failure of Parent to meet projections or
forecasts (unless due to any event, change, effect, development, condition or
occurrence which has otherwise resulted in a Parent Material Adverse Effect);
_except_ , in each case with respect to subclauses (A) Â— (B) and (E) Â— (G) of
this clause (iii), to the extent materially disproportionately affecting
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other similarly
situated companies in the industries in which Parent and its Subsidiaries

Violation_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has requisite partnership or corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement, the Consulting Agreements and
Noncompetition Agreements, the Support Agreements and each other document to
be entered into by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (together with this Agreement, the " _Parent Transaction
Documents_ ") and, subject to the approval of Parent as the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub, which approval shall be delivered by Parent immediately
following execution of this Agreement, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Parent Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
general partner of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub, and no
other entity or equity-holder proceedings on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or

contemplated hereby. As of the date of this Agreement, the general partner of
Parent has unanimously approved the issuance of Series B Units (the " _Unit
Issuance_ ") in connection with the Merger. Each of the Parent Transaction
Documents has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming such Parent Transaction Document constitutes the
legal, valid and binding agreement of the counterparty thereto, each of the
Parent Transaction Documents constitutes the legal, valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub and is enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by the Remedies Exceptions.

 



 

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the Exchange Act,

warranties of the Company in Section 3.3(b), no authorization, consent, order,
license, permit or approval of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is necessary, under applicable Law, for the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger and for such
authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that are not required to be
obtained or made prior to consummation of such transactions or that, if not
obtained or made, would not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially
and adversely affect the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries to operate
their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices.

 



 

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do
not, and, assuming receipt of the Parent Approvals, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any loss, or material suspension, limitation or
impairment of any right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to

 



      
 

 



 

own or use any assets material to the conduct of their business or result in
any material violation of, or material default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a
material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract,
instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Liens other
than Permitted Liens, in each case, upon any of the properties or assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any
violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or
other equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended or restated,
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) materially conflict with or
materially violate any applicable Laws.

 



 

Section 4.4. _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2009 (the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the
Parent SEC Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

 



 

Section 4.5. _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. ParentÂ’s disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to ParentÂ’s management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ParentÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ParentÂ’s internal control over

 



      
 

 



 

financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to ParentÂ’s auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Parent (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect ParentÂ’s ability to report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in ParentÂ’s internal
control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud
so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company prior to
the date hereof.

 



 

Section 4.6. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in ParentÂ’s consolidated balance sheets (or the notes thereto)
included in the Parent SEC Documents, (b) as permitted or contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31,
2010 **** in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
(d) for liabilities or obligations which have been discharged or paid in full
in the ordinary course of business, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of
Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other than those which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

occurrence, effect, condition, fact, event, or circumstance known to Parent
that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other

however_ , that no unintentional failure by Parent to provide a required
notice under the last sentence of this Section 5.2(a) with respect to any
matter that would not result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) shall result in a failure of the condition set forth in Section
6.2(b).

 



 

(b) Parent agrees with the Company that between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Parent:

 



 

(i) except in the ordinary course of business, shall not authorize or make any
distribution with respect to its outstanding equity securities (whether in

(iv) except as disclosed in Section 5.2(b)(iv) of the Parent Disclosure

(vi) knowingly or intentionally take any action that would reasonably be
expected to make any material representation or warranty of Parent or Merger
Sub hereunder inaccurate in any material respect or that would cause the
condition in Section 6.2(a) not to be met; and

 



 

(vii) shall not, and shall not permit any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries to,
agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

Section 5.3. _Mutual Access_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of furthering the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
the Company and Parent shall afford the other party and (i) the officers and
employees and (ii) the accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors and agents and other representatives (such persons described in this
clause (ii), collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of such other party
reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout the period prior to

SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel and properties, contracts, commitments, books and
records and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it
pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional
accounting, financing, operating, environmental and other data and information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably request,
and Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the Company may reasonably request, as the
case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation
of any agreement to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law. The
foregoing notwithstanding, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective officers, employees or Representatives, shall be permitted to
perform any onsite procedures (including an onsite study) with respect to any
property of the other party or any of the other partyÂ’s Subsidiaries without
the other partyÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed
to be "Evaluation Material," as such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the confidentiality agreement, dated as of May ** ** 12,
2011, among the Company, ETP and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

Section 5.4. _Non-Solicitation by the Company_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company, nor
any of their respective officers, directors or employees, shall, and that it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to (and shall not authorize or give permission to its and
their respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, seek or knowingly encourage or facilitate the making, submission or
announcement of, any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford
access to the business, properties, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, any person (other than Parent or Merger Sub), in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person (other than
Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend)
any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any letter of intent, term sheet,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange
agreement or any other agreement providing for any Acquisition Transaction or
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (except as
contemplated by Section 7.1(h)), or (vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing; provided, however, that this Section 5.4 shall not prohibit
(A) the Company, or the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or
indirectly through any officer, employee or Representative, prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, from taking any of the actions described in
clauses (ii) or (iii) above in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company, prior to taking any such
particular action, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel (it being understood that, for
purposes of this Section 5.4, such a financial advisor or outside legal
counsel shall include a financial advisor or outside legal counsel to a duly
constituted and acting committee of the Board of Directors of the Company),
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer if (1) the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely to constitute
a breach by the Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Laws, (2) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.4, (3) the Company gives to Parent the notice required by Section
5.4, and (4) the Company furnishes any non-public information provided to the
maker of the Acquisition Proposal only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
between the Company and such person on substantially the same terms as the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being acknowledged and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain a "standstill" or similar provision
that prohibits the third party recipient of such information from making any
Acquisition Proposal) and to the extent non-public information that has not
been made available to Parent is made available to the maker of the
Acquisition Proposal, provide such non-public information to Parent
substantially concurrent with the time that it is provided to such other
person; (B) the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated
under the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act with regard to any Acquisition Proposal (or making any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with any amendment to the terms of
a tender offer or exchange offer) so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this Section 5.4; (C) the Company, or the
Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or
Representative disclosing factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the fact that
an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy Statement or
otherwise, to the extent the Company in good faith determines that such
information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under
applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or (D) the
Company, or the Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through any
officer, employee or Representative making any statement or disclosure to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders required by applicable Law; provided that any such
action taken or statement or disclosure made that relates to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board of
Directors reaffirms its recommendation in favor of the proposed transaction in
such statement or disclosure or in connection with such action (except that a
mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of
the 1934 Act shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation). So long as the
Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with this Section 5.4,
none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its Representatives from
contacting in writing any persons or group of persons who has made an
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the
clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether
the Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Offer, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section
5.4.

 



 

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after its or any of its RepresentativesÂ’ receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, advise
Parent orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or request
(including providing the identity of the person making or submitting such
Acquisition Proposal or request, and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal and any related draft agreements and (y) if oral, a
reasonably detailed summary thereof that is made or submitted by any person
during the period between the date hereof and the Closing). The Company shall
keep Parent informed in all material respects on a prompt basis with respect
to any change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (and in
no event later than twenty-four (24) hours following any such change). The
Company agrees that it shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning itself or its Subsidiaries provided to any other person
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided
to Parent.

 



 

(c) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, (i) the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors and employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate
any discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or Representatives and any person (other than Parent) that relate to
any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives to, cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary to such
person.

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.4(e), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof may (i) withhold, withdraw
or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or modify, the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, or (ii) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this Section 5.4(d), a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to (i) an Intervening Event or (ii) an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company may at any time prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, make a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), if (and only if): (A) in the case of
(ii) above, (x) an Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
Section 5.4(a)) is made to the Company by a third party, and such Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn; (y) the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer; and (z)
the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors determines to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h), (B) in the case of (i) above, following
consultation with outside legal counsel, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors
determines that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach by the Board of Directors of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; (C) in the case of (i) and (ii) above,
(x) the Company provides Parent ninety-six (96) hourÂ’s prior written notice of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the information
with respect to such Intervening Event or Superior Offer, as the case may be,
that is specified in Section 5.4(b), (y) after providing such notice and prior
to making such Change of Recommendation in connection with an Intervening
Event or a Superior Offer or taking any action pursuant to Section 7.1(h) with
respect to a Superior Offer, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent during such ninety-six (96) hour period (to the extent that Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as
would permit the Board of Directors of the Company not to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event or a Superior Offer or
to take such action pursuant to Section 7.1(h) in response to a Superior
Offer, and (z) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that the event continues to constitute an
Intervening Event or that the Superior Offer would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal, in each case if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were to be given effect; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with an
Intervening Event or a Superior Offer or take any action pursuant to Section
7.1(h) with respect to a Superior Offer prior to the time that is ninety-six
(96) hours after it has provided the written notice required by clause (x)
above; provided further, that in the event that the Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall provide written notice of such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall
again comply with this Section 5.4(e), except that the CompanyÂ’s advance
written notice obligation shall be reduced to seventy-two (72) hours (rather
than the ninety-six (96) hours otherwise contemplated by this Section 5.4(e))
and the time the Company shall be

 



      
 

 



 

permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Offer or to take action pursuant to Section 7.1(h) with respect to a Superior
Offer shall be reduced to the time that is seventy-two (72) hours after it has
provided such written notice (rather than the time that is the ninety-six (96)
hours otherwise contemplated by this Section 5.4(e)) (but in no event prior to
the original ninety-six (96) hour advance notice period).

Acquisition Transaction;

 



 

(ii) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means any transaction or series of

other similar transaction or series of transactions which would result in a
person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) of persons having direct or
indirect beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than
twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding Company Common Stock; (C) any direct
or indirect acquisition of any business or businesses or of assets (including

percent (20%) or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets
(based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (D) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company or any of

Directors as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or

based upon the advice of the CompanyÂ’s financial advisor, be more favorable to
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and

Section 5.5. _Filings; Other Actions_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4,
in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders, as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any action
required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial securities laws
in connection with the issuance and reservation of Series B Units in the
Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company
and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without the otherÂ’s prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or the Company,
as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or
written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Series B Units issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting

 



      
 

 



 

of its stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act, to consider the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (the " _Stockholders Â’ Meeting_"). The Company will,
except in the case of a Change of Recommendation, through its Board of
Directors, recommend that its stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and to take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the
rules of the NYSE or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Equity-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall cause each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock or stock appreciation right relating to Company Common Stock granted
under a Company Benefit Plan that provides for equity-based compensation (each
such Company Benefit Plan, a " _Company Stock Plan_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Award_ ") to
become vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time and shall, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, provide notice
to all holders of Company Stock Awards that any Company Stock Award not
exercised prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminate upon
the Effective Time. In consideration of such cancellation and termination of
Company Stock Awards, the Company shall pay to each holder of a Company Stock
Award within five business days following the Effective Time an amount, less
applicable withholding Taxes, in cash with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Award equal to (i) (A) the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by (B) the Conversion Price minus (ii) the per share exercise
price or strike price of the Company Stock Award. If Parent determines the
consent of a holder of a Company Stock Award is required to effectuate the
termination of any Company Stock Award, then the Company shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent from the holder of such Company
Stock Award for no additional consideration, except as approved by Parent in
advance and (ii) shall make any amendments to the terms of the Company Stock
Plans or awards thereunder that may be necessary or advisable to give effect
to the termination of such Company Stock Awards, subject to the advance
approval of Parent which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Company shall require the holder of any Company Stock Award exercised prior
the Effective Time to satisfy any withholding obligation with respect to such
Company Stock Award in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plan and award agreement.

 



 

(b) Each award of restricted Company Common Stock granted under a Company
Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Restricted Shares_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and the
restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and such shares shall be
converted into, in accordance with Section 2.1, a number of Series B Units
(and cash in lieu of fractional Series B Units) equal to the product of (i)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such grant of
Restricted Shares and (ii) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that, unless the
holder of such Restricted Shares shall have remitted to the Company the amount
required to be withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, such number of
Series B Units to be received by such holder pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be
reduced by a number of Series B Units equal to the

 



      
 

 



 

amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law
divided by the Conversion Price.

 



 

(c) The Company shall cause each unvested award of restricted share units,
performance shares or phantom shares with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company RSU_ ") to become fully vested, and the Company
shall, within five business days following the Effective Time pay to the
holder of each outstanding Company RSU a lump sum cash payment, less any
applicable withholding Taxes, equal to the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio;
(ii) the Conversion Price and (iii) the total number of shares underlying such
Company RSU (giving effect to the acceleration of vesting contemplated by this
Section 5.6(c)).

 



 

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any actions
reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Section 5.6 Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the
holders of the Company Stock Awards and Company RSUs notices, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.7. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, to maintain for the individuals employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_ ")
compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits (i) provided to Current Employees as a group
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding, for this purpose, equity-
based compensation and participation in a defined-benefit pension plan unless
such participation is mandated by the terms of a collective bargaining or
other similar agreement between the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and an
employee representative) or (ii) provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide credit for each
Current Employees length of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time for eligibility, vesting and benefits accrual
purposes under any employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was recognized under a similar
Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , that such prior service credit shall not be
required to the extent it results in a duplication of benefits. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each health plan of Parent in
which any Current Employee participates following the Closing to (i) waive any
pre-existing condition limitation for any condition for which such Current
Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time and (ii) honor co-payments made, and
deductibles satisfied, by such Current Employee prior to the Effective Time.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Benefit Plans_ " means, with respect to any
entity, any compensation or employee benefit plans, programs, policies,
agreements or other arrangements, whether or not "employee benefit plans"
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or not subject to ERISA,
including bonus, cash or equity-based incentive, deferred compensation, stock
purchase, health,

 



       
 

 



 

medical, dental, disability, accident, life insurance, or vacation, paid time
off, perquisite, fringe benefit, severance, change of control, retention,
employment, separation, retirement, pension, or savings, plans, programs,
policies, agreements or arrangements for the benefit of current or former
directors, officers or employees of such entity or any of its Subsidiaries or
any dependant or beneficiary thereof.

 



 

(c) If requested by Parent, subject to the terms of any such Benefit Plan, the
CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, terminating, effective at least one day prior
to the Closing Date (the " _ERISA Effective Date_ "), any Company Benefit Plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code Section
401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (a " _401(k) Plan_"). Prior to the ERISA
Effective Date, the Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of
its Board of Directors authorizing such termination and amending any such
401(k) Plan commensurate with its termination to the extent necessary to
comply with all applicable Laws. The Company shall also take such other
actions in furtherance of the termination of each 401(k) Plan as Parent may
reasonably require, including such actions as Parent may require prior to the
Effective Time to support Parent obtaining a determination letter with respect
to the termination of each 401(k) Plan following the ERISA Effective Date. In
addition, if requested by Parent, the Company shall take such actions as may
be necessary to eliminate, as of no later than immediately prior to the
Effective Time, from any 401(k) Plan or other retirement plan, any investment
fund, election or alternative that provides for an investment directly in
shares of Company Common Stock.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be construed as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Benefit Plan or to prevent the amendment or
termination of any Benefit Plan. Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall limit the
right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any Current Employee at any time, subject to any
rights to severance or other separation benefits accrued as of the applicable
termination date under a Company Benefit Plan. Without limiting the generality
of Section 8.10, the provisions of this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer,
employee, other service provider or independent contractor or any other person
shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall
be construed as an amendment to any Parent Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan
or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Regulatory Approvals; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (subject to,
and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take, or cause to be taken,
promptly all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, promptly and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals, including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii)

necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries be required to pay any penalty, compensation or
other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required
under any contract or agreement for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any litigation,
administrative or judicial action or other proceeding is commenced challenging
the Merger or any of the proposed transactions, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such litigation,
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) as promptly as practicable
(and in any event not more than ten business days) after the date hereof, make
their respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions
under the HSR Act, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) timely making all
such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or
approvals, (C) assuring that all such filings are in material compliance with
the requirements of applicable Regulatory Laws, and (D) making available to

other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv)
subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications,
filings or correspondence (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (or members of their respective
staffs) with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to file applications for the FERC
Approval, the MDPU Approval, the MPSC Approval, the FCC Approval and any other
filings, determined to be required as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof and shall make such filings jointly if appropriate. Prior to
transmitting any material to any Governmental Entity (or members of their
respective staffs), the Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments thereon, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity (or members of their
respective staffs) to the extent permitted by Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity
or by Law, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, including (i) responding to and
complying with any request for information regarding the transactions from any
relevant Governmental Entity; (ii) ensuring the prompt expiration of any
applicable waiting period and clearance or approval by any such relevant
Governmental Entity, including defense against, and the resolution of, any
objections or challenges, in court or otherwise, by any relevant Governmental
Entity preventing consummation of the transactions; and (iii) assisting and
cooperating with the other party in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions, under any
applicable Regulatory Law with each relevant Governmental Entity. In the event
the parties, despite their commercially reasonable efforts, have not obtained
clearance or approval of the transactions from any relevant Governmental
Entity and/or resolved any objections or challenges by any relevant
Governmental Entity preventing consummation of the transactions by the Closing
Date, the Closing Date shall automatically be extended for an additional three
months, and thereafter shall be extended for any additional periods as agreed
by both Company and Parent.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.8 to the contrary, neither
party shall be required or obligated (and shall not be obligated to cause any
of its Subsidiaries) to agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise restrict
the use or operation of any business or assets of the Company or Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or agree to any conduct or other remedy, and
further, the Company shall not agree to take any such action or remedy without
the prior written consent of Parent.

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall not
take any action with the intention to, or that could reasonably be expected
to, hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary consent of any
Governmental Entity under any Regulatory Law or the expiration of the required
waiting period under any Regulatory Law.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.8 shall limit a partyÂ’s right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
Agreement, including this Section 5.8.

protect the national security or the national economy of any nation.

purport to be, applicable to the Merger, the Support Agreements or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six years
from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and any of its SubsidiaryÂ’s certificate of
incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors,
officers or employees in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and

officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the

applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of
each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another

 



      
 

 



 

corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such
personÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in
each case against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneysÂ’ fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that the Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by Delaware law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or
other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company). In the event of any such Action, the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directorsÂ’
and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the Effective Time by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that
Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of
the coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 



 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees, that may be incurred by any indemnified party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11.

 



 

(e) The rights of each indemnified party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such indemnified party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

 



 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of
such party set forth in this Section 5.11.

 



 

(g) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.11 shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to
adversely affect any

 



      
 

 



 

indemnified party (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this Section 5.11 applies without the consent of such
Indemnified Parties (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnifying Parties
to whom this Section 5.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.11, and this Section 5.11 shall survive consummation of the Merger
and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors, heirs and legal representatives against Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partyÂ’s
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other partyÂ’s
operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time,
each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of
stockholders of the Company.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Series B Units (including
derivative securities with respect to Series B Units) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.15. _Agreed Tax Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement intend
that the Merger be treated as a contribution by the holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Cancelled Shares) to Parent in exchange for the Series B
Units being issued in the Merger in a transaction qualifying under Section
721(a) of the Code. Each party hereto agrees to file all federal (and, to the
extent applicable, state and local) income tax returns reporting the Merger in
a manner consistent with such treatment. The preceding sentences of this
Section 5.15 shall not apply to the extent that a holder of Series B Units
receives money or other property, other than Common Units and other than a
reasonable guaranteed payment, a reasonable preferred return, or an operating
cash flow distribution (as each such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
section 1.707-4), from Parent on any date through and including the second
anniversary of the Closing. Provided the opinion conditions contained in
Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f) have been satisfied, Parent shall file the
opinions described in Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f) with the SEC by a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 promptly following the Closing,
unless opinions issued to the Company and Parent and addressing the
qualification of the Merger (in similar form to those opinions described in
Section 6.2(e) and Section 6.2(f)) were previously filed with the SEC.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.16. _Tax Representation Letters_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Bingham McCutchen LLP and Latham and Watkins LLP,
counsel to Parent (collectively "ParentÂ’s Counsel"), and Roberts and Holland LLP
and Locke Lord Bissell and Liddell, LLP, counsel to the Company (collectively
the "CompanyÂ’s Counsel"), a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the
Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date the Form S-4 shall have
been declared effective by the SEC) and signed by an officer of Parent and
Merger Sub, containing representations of Parent and Merger Sub, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to ParentÂ’s Counsel
and the CompanyÂ’s Counsel a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the
Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date the Form S-4 shall have
been declared effective by the SEC) and signed by an officer of the Company,
containing representations of the Company, in each case (notwithstanding
Section 3.24 and Section 4.22) as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to enable the CompanyÂ’s Counsel to render the opinions described in Section
6.2(f) and ParentÂ’s Counsel to render the opinions described in Section
6.2(e).

 



 

Section 5.17. _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause

shall be true and correct both at and as of the date of this Agreement and at
and as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date

Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the
Closing Date (without regard to "materiality", Company Material Adverse Effect

Parent may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or
terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 or

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.2(f), as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused
by such partyÂ’s willful and intentional material breach of any material
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 7.1. _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after any approval of
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to June 30, 2012 (the " _End Date_ "), _provided,
however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing, other than the condition
set forth in Section 6.1(c), shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of
being satisfied at such time, the End Date may be extended by Parent or the
Company from time to time by written notice to the other party up to a date
not beyond December 31, 2012, the latest of any of which dates shall
thereafter be deemed to be the End Date; and provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall
be due to the material breach by such party of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent if an injunction shall have been entered
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove such
injunction to the extent such party is required to use its reasonable best
efforts pursuant to this Agreement;

 



 

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the StockholdersÂ’ Meeting (including
any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

 



 

(e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 and (ii) by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if by its nature such breach
or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, Parent does not
diligently attempt or ceases to diligently attempt to cure such breach or
failure after receiving written notice from the Company describing such breach
or failure in reasonable detail (provided that the Company is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein);

 



 

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which

 



       
 

 



 

breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2(f) and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured
prior to the End Date or, if by its nature such breach or failure is capable
of being cured by the End Date, the Company does not diligently attempt or
ceases to diligently attempt to cure such breach or failure after receiving
written notice from Parent describing such breach or failure in reasonable
detail (provided that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

 



 

(g) by Parent, (i) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event of
a Change of Recommendation or if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have approved or recommended to its shareholders an Acquisition Transaction,
or (ii) the Company shall have willfully and materially breached any of its
obligations under Section 5.4; and

 



 

(h) by the Company, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and if
the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 5.4, in order to
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer; provided
that any such purported termination by the Company pursuant to this Section
7.1(h) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company pays to
Parent the expense reimbursement in accordance with Section 7.3(a) and the
Breakup Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(c).

 



 

Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall terminate (except for
the provisions of Section 7.3 and Article VIII), and there shall be no other
liability on the part of the Company or Parent to the other except as provided
in Section 7.3 and, subject to Section 7.3(g), liability arising out of or the
result of, fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any covenant or
agreement or willful or intentional breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement occurring prior to termination or as provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled
to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 7.3. _Expense Reimbursement; Breakup Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by either the Company or Parent

Representative of the Company (or any person shall have publicly announced a
bona fide intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition
Proposal), and such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior
to such termination and (B) within twelve months after such termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall have consummated, or shall have entered into

period), an Acquisition Transaction, (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d), (iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f), (iv) by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(g), or (v) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then the

Merger or related to the preparation, negotiation,

 



      
 

 



 

execution and performance of this Agreement and the Support Agreements,
including all fees and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, accountants,
experts, and consultants retained by Parent or Merger Sub, such amount not to
exceed $12.5 million.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e),
then Parent shall promptly upon written demand by the Company (and in any
event no later than two business days after such written demand is delivered

Company, such amount not to exceed $12.5 million.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f),
(ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(g) or (iii) by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(h), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Breakup Fee (x)

termination pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above and (y) upon termination of
this Agreement, and as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination,
in the case of a termination pursuant to clause (iii) above.

 



 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and
(i) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, any person (other than Parent
or its affiliates) shall have made an Acquisition Proposal which shall have
been publicly announced or disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Company,
the Board of Directors of the Company or any Representative of the Company (or
any person shall have publicly announced a bona fide intention, whether or not
conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) and such Acquisition Proposal
shall not have been withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholder Approval and
(ii) within twelve months after such termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall have consummated, or shall have entered into an agreement to
consummate (which may be consummated after such twelve-month period), an
Acquisition Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Breakup Fee,
by wire transfer of same day federal funds to the account specified by Parent,
on the date such Acquisition Transaction is consummated, or, if earlier,
contemporaneously with or immediately after the entry into of any binding
agreement to consummate the Acquisition Transaction.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e),
then Parent shall pay to the Company the Breakup Fee in immediately available
funds within two (2) business days after termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Solely for purposes of this Section 7.3, " _Acquisition Transaction_ "
shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 5.4, except that all
references to twenty-five percent (25%) shall be changed to fifty percent
(50%).

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Breakup Fee_ " means $135.0 million;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(h) during the first 40 days after the date of this
Agreement, then " _Breakup Fee_ " means $92.5 million.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Upon payment of the Breakup Fee to Parent, the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to Parent or its stockholders; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall release any party from liability arising out of or the result of,
fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any covenant or agreement or
willful or intentional breach of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Breakup Fee on more than one occasion. In
addition, the parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, neither
party would enter into this Agreement. If the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails to pay promptly the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3,
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, will also pay to Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, such partyÂ’s reasonable costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including
the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment,
together with interest on the unpaid amount under this Section 7.3, accruing
from its due date, at an interest rate per annum equal to two percentage
points in excess of the prime commercial lending rate quoted by The Wall
Street Journal. Any change in the interest rate hereunder resulting from a
change in such prime rate will be effective at the beginning of the date of
such change in such prime rate.

agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or

jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

given, and such notice shall be deemed to have been delivered as of the date
so telecommunicated or personally delivered. Any party to this Agreement may
notify any other party of any changes to the address or any of the other
details specified in this paragraph; _provided, however_ , that such
notification

 



      
 

 



 

shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice or five (5)
business days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection or
other refusal to accept or the inability to deliver because of changed address
of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be receipt of the notice as of
the date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver.

 



 

Section 8.8. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
for assignments by Merger Sub to a wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary
of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 8.9. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 8.10. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this Agreement is not intended to
grant standing to any person other than the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.11. _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided, however_ , that after
receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall
by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE
require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness
of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.12. _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.13. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees that (a) their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and (b) except for Section 5.11, this Agreement is not intended

 



       
 

 



 

to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein.

 



 

Section 8.14. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any statute defined
or referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
statutes. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation
of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the
parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

 **FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED**

 



 

 **AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP**

 

 **OF**

 

 **ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY, L.P.**

 



 

THIS FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF ENERGY
TRANSFER EQUITY, L.P. dated as of **[** ***** **]** , 2011, is entered into by
and among LE GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the General
Partner, together with any other Persons who become Partners in the
Partnership or parties hereto as provided herein. In consideration of the
covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS**

 



 

Section 1.1 _ __Definitions_.

 



 

The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly
indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.

 



 

" _Acquisition_ " means any transaction in which any Group Member acquires
(through an asset acquisition, merger, stock acquisition or other form of
investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or
business of another Person for the purpose of increasing the operating
capacity or revenues of the Partnership Group from the operating capacity or
revenues of the Partnership Group existing immediately prior to such
transaction.

 



 

" _Additional Book Basis_ " means the portion of any remaining Carrying Value
of an Adjusted Property that is attributable to positive adjustments made to
such Carrying Value as a result of Book-Up Events. For purposes of determining
the extent that Carrying Value constitutes Additional Book Basis:

 



 

(i) Any negative adjustment made to the Carrying Value of an Adjusted Property
as a result of either a Book-Down Event or a Book-Up Event shall first be
deemed to offset or decrease that portion of the Carrying Value of such
Adjusted Property that is attributable to any prior positive adjustments made
thereto pursuant to a Book-Up Event or Book-Down Event.

 



 

(ii) If Carrying Value that constitutes Additional Book Basis is reduced as a
result of a Book-Down Event and the Carrying Value of other property is
increased as a result of such Book-Down Event, an allocable portion of any
such increase in Carrying Value shall be treated as Additional Book Basis;
provided that the amount treated as Additional Book Basis pursuant hereto as a
result of such Book-Down Event shall not exceed the amount by which the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments after such Book-Down Event
exceeds the remaining Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the
PartnershipÂ’s Adjusted Property after such Book-Down Event (determined without
regard to the application of this clause (ii) to such Book-Down Event).

      
 

 



 

" _Additional Book Basis Derivative Items_ " means any Book Basis Derivative
Items that are computed with reference to Additional Book Basis. To the extent
that the Additional Book Basis attributable to all of the PartnershipÂ’s
Adjusted Property as of the beginning of any taxable period exceeds the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments as of the beginning of such
period (the " _Excess Additional Book Basis_ "), the Additional Book Basis
Derivative Items for such period shall be reduced by the amount that bears the
same ratio to the amount of Additional Book Basis Derivative Items determined
without regard to this sentence as the Excess Additional Book Basis bears to
the Additional Book Basis as of the beginning of such period.

 



 

" _Additional Limited Partner_ " means a Person admitted to the Partnership as
a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 4.5 and who is shown as such on the
books and records of the Partnership.

 



 

" _Adjusted Capital Account_ " means the Capital Account maintained for each
Partner as of the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership, (a) increased by
any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the standards set
by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is deemed obligated to
restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5)) and
(b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and deductions that, as of the
end of such fiscal year, are reasonably expected to be allocated to such
Partner in subsequent years under Section 704(e)(2) and Section 706(d) of the
Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and (ii) the amount of
all distributions that, as of the end of such fiscal year, are reasonably
expected to be made to such Partner in subsequent years in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or otherwise to the extent they exceed offsetting
increases to such PartnerÂ’s Capital Account that are reasonably expected to
occur during (or prior to) the year in which such distributions are reasonably
expected to be made (other than increases as a result of a minimum gain
chargeback pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i) or Section 6.1(d)(ii)). The foregoing
definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply with the
provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. The " _Adjusted Capital Account_ " of a
Partner in respect of a General Partner Interest, a Common Unit or any other
Partnership Interest shall be the amount that such Adjusted Capital Account
would be if such General Partner Interest, Common Unit or other Partnership
Interest were the only interest in the Partnership held by a Partner from and
after the date on which such General Partner Interest, Common Unit or other
Partnership Interest was first issued.

 



 

" _Adjusted Property_ " means any property the Carrying Value of which has
been adjusted pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(i) or Section 5.3(d)(ii).

 



 

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is
controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in question. As used
herein, the term " _control_ " means the possession, direct or indirect, of
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

" _Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments_ " means, as of the end of any
taxable period, the sum of the Remaining Net Positive Adjustments of all the
Partners.

 



      
 

 



 

" _Agreed Allocation_ " means any allocation, other than a Required
Allocation, of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.1, including, without limitation, a Curative
Allocation (if appropriate to the context in which the term " _Agreed
Allocation_ " is used).

 



 

" _Agreed Value_ " of any Contributed Property means the fair market value of
such property or other consideration at the time of contribution as determined
by the General Partner. The General Partner shall use such method as it
determines to be appropriate to allocate the aggregate Agreed Value of
Contributed Properties contributed to the Partnership in a single or
integrated transaction among each separate property on a basis proportional to
the fair market value of each Contributed Property.

 



 

" _Agreement_ " means this Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of Energy Transfer Equity, L.P., as it may be amended,
supplemented or restated from time to time.

 



 

" _Assignee_ " means a Person to whom one or more Limited Partner Interests
have been transferred in a manner permitted under this Agreement and who has
executed and delivered a Transfer Application, including a Taxation
Certification, as required by this Agreement but who has not been admitted as
a Substituted Limited Partner.

 



 

" _Associate_ " means, when used to indicate a relationship with any Person,
(a) any corporation or organization of which such Person is a director,
officer or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the owner of 20% or more of

Section 4.2 _ __Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates_.

 



 

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent (for

the General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the
Limited Partner or Assignee shall be precluded from making any claim against
the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such transfer
or for a new Certificate.

whether the Partnership shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership
Interests are listed or admitted for trading. Without limiting the foregoing,
when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing
corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent
or in some other representative capacity for another Person in acquiring
and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the one
hand, and such other Persons on the other, such representative Person (a)
shall be the Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) of record and
beneficially, and (b) shall be bound by this Agreement and shall have the

law or otherwise, including any transfer upon foreclosure of any pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation or mortgage.

transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this Article IV shall be null and void.

purpose of registering Common Units and transfers of such Common Units as

officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and
deliver, and in the case of Common Units, the Transfer Agent shall countersign

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.8, the Partnership shall not
recognize any transfer of Limited Partner Interests until (i) the Certificates
evidencing such Limited Partner Interests are surrendered for registration of
transfer and (ii) following a FERC Notice, such Certificates are accompanied
by a Transfer Application and accompanying Taxation Certification, properly
completed and duly executed by the transferee (or the transfereeÂ’s attorney-
in-fact duly authorized in writing). No charge shall be imposed by the General
Partner for such transfer; _provided_ , that as a condition to the issuance of
any new Certificate under this Section 4.5, the General Partner may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
that may be imposed with respect thereto. Following a FERC Notice, no
distributions or allocations will be made in respect of the Limited Partner
Interests until a properly completed Transfer Application has been delivered.

 



 

(c) Limited Partner Interests may be transferred only in the manner described
in this Section 4.5. The transfer of any Limited Partner Interests and the
admission of any new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this
Agreement.

transferable.

 



 

Section 4.6 _ __Transfer of the General Partner Interest_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, prior to December 31, 2015, the General
Partner shall not transfer all or any part of its General Partner Interest
(represented by General Partner Units) to a Person unless such transfer (i)
has been approved by the prior written consent or vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held
by the General Partner and its Affiliates) **** or (ii) is of all, but not
less than all, of its General Partner Interest (represented by General Partner
Units) to (A) an Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an individual)
or (B) another Person (other than an individual) in connection with the merger
or consolidation of the General Partner with or into another Person (other

substantially all of its assets to another Person (other than an individual).

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 4.6(c) below, on or after December 31, 2015, the
General Partner may transfer all or any of its General Partner Interest

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest
(represented by General Partner Units) to another Person shall be permitted
unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the rights and duties of the
General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement and (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion of Counsel that such
transfer would not result in the loss of limited liability under Delaware law
of any Limited Partner or cause the Partnership to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed),
(iii) such transferee also agrees to purchase all (or the appropriate portion
thereof, if applicable) of the partnership or membership interest of the
General Partner as the general partner or managing member, if any, of each
other Group Member. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance
with this Section 4.6, the transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall,
subject to compliance with the terms of Section 10.2, be admitted to the
Partnership as the General Partner immediately prior to the transfer of the
General Partner Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue
without dissolution.

 



 

Section 4.7 _ __Restrictions on Transfers_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 4.7(d) below, but notwithstanding the other
provisions of this Article IV, no transfer of any Partnership Interests shall
be made if such

 



      
 

 



 

transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal or state securities
laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state securities
commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such
transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the Partnership
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, or (iii) cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed).

 



 

(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership
Interests if it receives an Opinion of Counsel that such restrictions are
necessary to avoid a significant risk of the Partnership becoming taxable as a
corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for federal income tax
purposes. The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment that would result in
the delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner
Interests on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of
Limited Partner Interests is then listed or admitted for trading must be
approved, prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.

 



 

(c) The transfer of a Series A Preferred Unit shall be subject to the
restrictions imposed by Section 5.8(b)(x) and Section 6.4. The transfer of a
Series B Unit shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by Section 6.5.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere in this Agreement,
shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership
Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted for
trading.

 



 

(e) Each certificate evidencing Partnership Interests shall bear a conspicuous
legend in substantially the following form:

 



 

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF ENERGY TRANSFER
EQUITY, L.P. THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE
FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE
EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY, L.P. UNDER THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY, L.P. TO BE TREATED
AS AN ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED AS AN
ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY SO TREATED
OR TAXED). LE GP, LLC, THE GENERAL PARTNER OF ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY, L.P.,
MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT
RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID

 



      
 

 



 

A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY, L.P. BECOMING TAXABLE AS A
CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT
OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE
FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS
LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING.

 



 

Section 4.8 _ __Taxation Certifications; Ineligible Assignees_.

 



 

(a) Following a FERC Notice, if a transferee of a Limited Partner Interest
fails to furnish a properly completed Taxation Certification in the manner
specified in Section 4.5(b) or if, upon receipt of such Taxation Certification
or otherwise, the General Partner determines that such transferee is not an
Eligible Holder, the Limited Partner Interests owned by such transferee shall
be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.9.

 



 

(b) Following a FERC Notice, the General Partner may request any Limited
Partner or Assignee to furnish to the General Partner, within 30 days after
receipt of such request, an executed Taxation Certification or such other
information concerning his federal income tax status with respect to the
income and loss generated by the Partnership (or, if the Limited Partner or
Assignee is a nominee holding for the account of another Person, the federal
income tax status of such Person) as the General Partner may reasonably
request. If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to furnish to the General
Partner within the aforementioned 30-day period such Taxation Certification or
other requested information or if upon receipt of such Taxation Certification
or other requested information the General Partner determines that a Limited
Partner or Assignee is not an Eligible Holder, the Limited Partner Interests
owned by such Limited Partner or Assignee shall be subject to redemption in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.9. In addition, the General
Partner may require that the status of any such Limited Partner or Assignee be
changed to that of an Ineligible Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner
shall be substituted for such Ineligible Assignee as the Limited Partner in
respect of the Ineligible AssigneeÂ’s Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(c) Following a FERC Notice, the General Partner shall, in exercising voting
rights in respect of Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of
Ineligible Assignees, distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of
Partners (including without limitation the General Partner) in respect of
Limited Partner Interests other than those of Ineligible Assignees are cast,
either for, against or abstaining as to the matter.

 



 

(d) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Assignee shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 12.4 but shall be
entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible AssigneeÂ’s share of any
distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Ineligible
Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive
his share of such distribution in kind).

 



       
 

 



 

(e) At any time after an Ineligible Assignee can and does certify that it has
become an Eligible Holder, such Ineligible Assignee may, upon application to
the General Partner, request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner with
respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such Ineligible Assignee not
redeemed pursuant to Section 4.9, such Ineligible Assignee be admitted as a
Limited Partner, and upon admission of such Ineligible Assignee pursuant to
Section 10.2 the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the Limited
Partner in respect of such Ineligible AssigneeÂ’s Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

Section 4.9 _ __Redemption of Partnership Interests of Ineligible Assignees_.

 



 

(a) If at any time following a FERC Notice, the General Partner determines
that Limited Partners, Assignees and transferees of Limited Partner Interests
that are not Eligible Holders own, in the aggregate, 15% or more of the
Outstanding Units, the Partnership may redeem the Limited Partner Interest of
any Limited Partner, Assignee or transferee of any Limited Partner, Assignee
or transferee that has failed to furnish to the General Partner a Transfer
Application and accompanying Taxation Certification pursuant to Section 4.5(b)
or that has failed to furnish to the General Partner a Taxation Certification
or other information requested within the 30-day period specified in Section
4.8(a), or if upon receipt of such Taxation Certification or other information
the General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited
Partner, Assignee or transferee is not an Eligible Holder, in accordance with
the following procedures:

 



 

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner,
Assignee or transferee, at his last address designated on the records of the
Partnership or the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The
notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption,
the place of payment, and that payment of the redemption price will be made
upon surrender of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests.

 



 

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests of a Limited
Partner, Assignee or transferee shall be an amount equal to the Current Market
Price (the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for
redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the class to be so redeemed
multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests of each such class
included among the Redeemable Interests owned by such Limited Partner,
Assignee or transferee. The redemption price shall be paid as determined by
the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the
Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest
at the rate of 5% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of
principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the
redemption date.

 



 

(iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner, Assignee or
transferee, at the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the
Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by an assignment duly executed in blank, the Limited Partner,
Assignee or transferee, or his duly authorized representative shall be
entitled to receive the payment therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer
constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this Section 4.9 shall also be applicable to Limited
Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner or Assignee as nominee of a Person
determined to be other than an Eligible Holder.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Section 4.9 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the
redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement.
Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw
the notice of redemption, provided the transferee of such Limited Partner
Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner in a Taxation
Certification that he is an Eligible Holder. If the transferee fails to make
such certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on
the original redemption date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 5.1 _ __Issuance of Partnership Interests_ __.

 



 

Upon the issuance of any additional Limited Partner Interests by the
Partnership, the General Partner may make, but is not obligated to make,
additional Capital Contributions equal to its percentage interest (the
quotient determined by dividing such General PartnerÂ’s Percentage Interest by
the sum of 100 less such General PartnerÂ’s Percentage Interest) of any amount
contributed to the Partnership by the Limited Partners in exchange for such
additional Limited Partner Interests. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence
and except as set forth in Article XII, the General Partner shall not be
obligated to make any additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership.

 



 

Section 5.2 _ __Interest and Withdrawal_.

 



 

No interest on Capital Contributions shall be paid by the Partnership. No
Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its
Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made
pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be
considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this
Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no
Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Partner or Assignee
either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners or
Assignees agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

 



 

Section 5.3 _ __Capital Accounts_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of
Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has
furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with
Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General
Partner) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect
to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury

 



      
 

 



 

Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and the methodology set forth in Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s). The initial Capital Account
balance attributable to the Series B Units shall equal the product of the
number of Series B Units so issued and the Issue Price for each such Series B
Unit, and the initial Capital Account balance attributable to each such Series
B Unit shall equal its Issue Price. Thereafter, such Capital Account shall be
increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the
Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including,
without limitation, income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance
with Section 5.3(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest
pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed
Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with
respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all
items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section
5.3(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to
Section 6.1. The Partnership shall follow the methodology set forth in the
proposed noncompensatory option regulations under Proposed Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-1, 1.721-2 and 1.761-3 at all times, including when the assets
of the Partnership are revalued or any Series A Preferred Units or Series B
Units are converted pursuant to Section 5.8 or Section 5.9. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Series A Preferred Units and Series B Units will be treated as a
partnership interest in the Partnership for federal income tax purposes, and,
therefore, each holder of a Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit will be
treated as a partner in the Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
General Partner shall maintain and adjust Capital Accounts as necessary to the
extent the rights and obligations of the Series B Units under Section 5.9
result in the application of Section 707 of the Code.

 



 

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction which is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be
reflected in the PartnersÂ’ Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including,
without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for that purpose), _provided_ , that:

 



 

(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.3, the Partnership shall be treated
as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General
Partner based upon the provisions of the MLP Agreement) of all property owned
by the MLP or any other Subsidiary that is classified as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to Section 6.1.

 



 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described
in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the
fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither

 



      
 

 



 

currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the
extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset
pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.

 



 

(iv) Any income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to the taxable
disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted
basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to
the PartnershipÂ’s Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such
date.

 



 

(v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.3(d)
to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be
determined as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the
Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment.

 



 

(vi) If the PartnershipÂ’s adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery
property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section
48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost
recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall be
allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. Any restoration of such
basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall, to the extent possible,
be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom such deemed deduction
was allocated.

 



 

(c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion
of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest
so transferred.

 



 

(d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)
and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s), on an issuance
of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the
issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of
services, the conversion of the General PartnerÂ’s Combined Interest to Units
pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit or
the conversion of Series B Unit, the Capital Account of all Partners and the
Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such
issuance, or immediately after such conversion (with respect to the conversion
of a Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit), shall be adjusted upward or
downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to
such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had
been recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to
such issuance or on the date of such conversion. Any such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss (or items thereof) shall be allocated (A) if the operation of
this sentence is triggered by the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit or
Series B Unit, first to the Partners holding converted Series A Preferred
Units or Series B Units until the Capital Account of each converted Series A
Preferred Unit or Series B Unit is equal to

 



      
 

 



 

the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a
converted Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit), and (B) any remaining
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated among the Partners
pursuant to Sections 6.1(c) and (d) in the same manner as any item of gain or
loss actually recognized would have been allocated. If the Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss allocated as a result of the conversion of a Series A
Preferred Unit or Series B Unit is not sufficient to cause the Capital Account
of each converted Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit to equal the Per
Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a converted
Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit), then Capital Account balances shall
be reallocated between the Partners holding converted Series A Preferred Units
or Series B Units, and the Partners holding Common Units (other than converted
Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units) so as to cause the Capital Account
of each converted Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit to equal the Per
Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a converted
Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit), in accordance with Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3). In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market
value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash
equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership
Interests, or immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit or
a Series B Unit, shall be determined by the General Partner using such method
of valuation as it may adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in
arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value
of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and must reduce the
fair market value of all Partnership assets by the excess, if any, of the fair
market value of any Outstanding Series A Preferred Units or Outstanding Series
B Units that have not yet been converted over the aggregate Issue Price of
such Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units to the extent of any
Unrealized Gain that has not been reflected in the PartnersÂ’ Capital Accounts
previously, pursuant to Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate
value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines) to
arrive at a fair market value for individual properties.

 



 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately
prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and
had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 6.1 in
the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized during such
period would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all
Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual
distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a
deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that
provided in Section 5.3(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution
pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using
such method of valuation as it may adopt.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.4 _ __Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options,
rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership
Securities for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to
such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as the
General Partner shall determine, all without the approval of any Limited
Partners.

 



 

(b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to Section 5.4(a) may be issued in one or more classes,
or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the
General Partner, including (i) the right to share in Partnership profits and
losses or items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions;
(iii) the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv)
whether, and the terms and conditions upon which the Partnership may or shall
be required to redeem the Partnership Security (including sinking fund
provisions); (v) whether such Partnership Security is issued with the
privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of
such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each
Partnership Security will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or
transferred; (vii) the method for determining the Percentage Interest as to
such Partnership Security; and (viii) the right, if any, of each such
Partnership Security to vote on Partnership matters, including matters
relating to the relative designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties
of such Partnership Security.

 



 

(c) The General Partner is hereby authorized and directed to take all actions
that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each
issuance of Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and
appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this
Section 5.4, (ii) the conversion of the General Partner Interest (represented
by General Partner Units) into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
(iii) the admission of additional Limited Partners and (iv) all additional
issuances of Partnership Securities. The General Partner shall determine the
relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units or other
Partnership Securities being so issued. The General Partner shall do all
things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and
directed to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in
connection with any future issuance of Partnership Securities or in connection
with the conversion of the General Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule,
regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or
any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership
Securities are listed or admitted for trading.

 



 

(d) No fractional Partnership Securities shall be issued by the Partnership.
If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units pursuant to Section 5.4
would result in the issuance of fractional Units, each fractional Unit shall
be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the
next higher Unit).

 



 

Section 5.5 _ __Limited Preemptive Right_.

 



 

Except as provided in Section 5.3 and in this Section 5.5, no Person shall
have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the
issuance of any Partnership

 



      
 

 



 

Security, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter created. The
General Partner shall have the right, which it may from time to time assign in
whole or in part to any of its Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Securities
from the Partnership whenever, and on the same terms that, the Partnership
issues Partnership Securities to Persons other than the General Partner and
its Affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests
of the General Partner and its Affiliates equal to that which existed
immediately prior to the issuance of such Partnership Securities. The General
Partner shall be deemed to have waived this right with respect to any issuance
of a particular Partnership Security in the event that the General Partner has
not exercised this right prior to the issuance of such Partnership Security.

 



 

Section 5.6 _ __Splits and Combinations_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 5.4(d), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata
distribution of Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a
subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any
such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the
Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit
basis or stated as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted.

 



 

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public
accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities
to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution,
subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on
any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy
of such calculation.

 



 

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership
Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of
Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may
adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate
to reflect such changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total
number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require,
as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the
surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to
such Record Date.

 



 

Section 5.7 _ __Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests_.

 



 

All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the
requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited
Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such nonassessability may be
affected by Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.8 _Establishment of Series A Preferred Units._

 



 

(a) _General._ The General Partner hereby designates and creates a series of
Units to be designated as "Series A Convertible Preferred Units" and
consisting of a total of 3,000,000 Series A Preferred Units, having the same
rights, preferences and privileges, and subject to the same duties and
obligations, as the Common Units, except as set forth in this Section 5.8 and
in Section 5.3(d)(i), Section 6.4 and Section 12.10. The class of Series A
Preferred Units shall be closed immediately following the Series A Issuance
Date and thereafter no additional Series A Preferred Units shall be
designated, created or issued without the prior written approval of the
General Partner and the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units.

 



 

(b) _Rights of Series A Preferred Units. _The Series A Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and shall be subject to
the following duties and obligations:

 



 

(i) _Allocations_. Items of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall
be allocated to the Series A Preferred Units for each taxable year (or portion
thereof) in the manner set forth in Section 6.1(e).

 



 

(ii) _Distributions_.

 



 

A. Commencing on the Series A Issuance Date, the holders of the Series A
Preferred Units as of an applicable Record Date shall accrue and be entitled
to receive cumulative cash distributions, Ratably, with distributions on the
Series B Units but prior to any other distributions pursuant to Section 6.3,
in an amount equal to the Series A Distribution Rate on each Outstanding
Series A Preferred Unit. All such distributions shall be paid Quarterly, in
arrears, within 50 days after the end of each Quarter (a " _Series A
Distribution Payment Date_"). If the Partnership fails to pay in full in cash
any distribution (or portion thereof) which any holder of Series A Preferred
Units is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(ii)(A), then (x)
the amount of such accrued and unpaid distribution will accumulate until paid
in full in cash and (y) the Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall
not, declare or make (i) any distributions in respect of any Series A Junior
Securities and (ii) any distributions in respect of any Series A Parity
Securities, other than Series A Pro Rata Distributions, unless and until all
accrued and accumulated distributions on the Series A Preferred Units have
been paid in full in cash.

 



 

B. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to
Series A Preferred Units that are converted into Common Units, the holder
thereof shall not be entitled to a Series A Preferred Unit distribution and a
Common Unit distribution with respect to the same period, but shall be
entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the class of Units
held as of the

 



      
 

 



 

close of business on the Record Date for the distribution in respect of such
period.

 



 

C. Accrued and unpaid distributions in respect of the Series A Preferred Units
will not accrue or be entitled to interest.

 



 

(iii) _Issuance of Series A Preferred Units_. The Series A Preferred Units
shall be issued by the Partnership pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Regency GP Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Liquidation Value_. The rights, preferences and privileges of the Series
A Preferred Units in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Partnership, either voluntary or involuntary, are set forth in Section
12.10.

 



 

(v) _Voting Rights_.

 



 

A. The Series A Preferred Units shall not be entitled to vote on any matters
related to the Partnership other than as expressly provided in this Section
5.8(b)(v).

 



 

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting separately as a class with
one vote per Series A Preferred Unit, shall be necessary to amend this
Agreement in any manner that (i) alters or changes the rights, preferences or
privileges or duties and obligations of the Series A Preferred Units, (ii)
increases or decreases the authorized number of Series A Preferred Units
(including without limitation any issuance of additional Series A Preferred
Units), or (iii) otherwise adversely affects the Series A Preferred Units in
any material respect, including without limitation the creation (by
reclassification or otherwise) of any class of Series A Senior Securities (or
amending the provisions of any existing class of Partnership Securities to
make such class of Partnership Securities a class of Series A Senior
Securities); _provided, however_ , that the Partnership may, without the
consent or approval of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units (a) create
(by reclassification or otherwise) and issue Series A Junior Securities and
Series A Parity Securities (including by amending the provisions of any
existing class of Partnership Securities to make such class of Partnership
Securities a class of Series A Junior Securities or Series A Parity
Securities) in an unlimited amount and (b) consummate any Fundamental Change.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) _Certificates_.

 



 

A. The Series A Preferred Units shall be evidenced by certificates in such
form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to the satisfaction of
any applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, may be assigned
or transferred in a manner identical to the assignment and transfer of other
Units; unless and until the General Partner determines to assign the
responsibility to another Person, the General Partner will act as the
registrar and transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Units. The
certificates evidencing Series A Preferred Units shall be separately
identified and shall not bear the same CUSIP number as the certificates
evidencing Common Units.

 



 

B. The certificate(s) representing the Series A Preferred Units may be
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form (in addition to
the legend required pursuant to Section 4.7(e)):

 



 

"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING."

 



 

(vii) _Conversion_.

 



 

A. Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 5.8(b)(xi)and (xii),
immediately prior to the close of business on the Series A Maturity Date, each
Series A Preferred Unit shall convert into the right to receive, upon the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 5.8(b)(vii), at the
election of the Partnership, either:

 



 

a. a number of Common Units equal to:

 



 

i. the sum of (A) the Series A Liquidation Value as of the Series A Maturity
Date plus (B) the lesser of (1) the Series A Accretion Amount as of the Series
A Maturity Date and (2) $10.00, divided by

 



 

ii. the VWAP Price as of the Series A Maturity Date; or

 



 

b. a number of Common Units and an amount of cash equal to:

 



 

i. a number of Common Units equal to (x) the sum of (A) fifty percent (50%) of
the Series A Liquidation Value as of the Series A Maturity Date plus (B) the
lesser of (1) the Series A Accretion Amount as of the Series A Maturity Date
and (2) $10.00, divided by (y) the VWAP Price as of the Series A Maturity
Date, and

 



 

ii. an amount of cash equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Series A Liquidation
Value as of the Series A Maturity Date (the cash consideration to be received
pursuant to this clause (ii), the " _Series A Conversion Cash
Consideration_").

 



 

The consideration to be received by the holder of a Series A Preferred Unit
upon the conversion of such Series A Preferred Unit as provided in this
Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A) is referred to as the " _Series A Conversion
Consideration._"

 



 

B. Any Common Units received by a holder of Series A Preferred Units as the
Series A Conversion Consideration shall be fully paid, validly issued and non-
assessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act).
Immediately prior to the close of

 



      
 

 



 

business on the Series A Maturity Date, all Series A Preferred Units shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent solely the right
to receive the Series A Conversion Consideration. All Series A Preferred Units
that have converted into the right to receive the Series A Conversion
Consideration shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and
the holders of converted Series A Preferred Units shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Series A Preferred Units other than the right to
receive the Series A Conversion Consideration. Upon such conversion, any
certificates representing Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter represent
solely the right to receive the Series A Conversion Consideration.

 



 

C. Within two Business Days following the Series A Maturity Date, the
Partnership shall send written notice (a " _Series A Conversion Notice_") to
each holder of record of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units as of the Series
A Maturity Date, stating:

 



 

a. the election of the Partnership as to whether the Series A Preferred Units
have converted into (i) Common Units pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A)(a) or
(ii) both Common Units and the Series A Conversion Cash Consideration pursuant
to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A)(b);

 



 

b. the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the number of Common Units to be issued
and the amount of Series A Conversion Cash Consideration, if any, to be paid
in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A)
(including, in each case, any adjustments pursuant to Sections 5.8(b)(xi) and
(xii)), including the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the Series A Liquidation
Value, the Series A Accretion Amount and the VWAP Price, in each case as of
the Series A Maturity Date; and

 



 

c. that the holder must surrender the certificate or certificates representing
any Series A Preferred Units held by such holder to the Partnership, and
provide such other documentation as reasonably requested by the General
Partner including wire transfer instructions in respect of any Series A Cash
Conversion Cash Consideration or any Fractional Unit Cash Consideration (the "
_Series A Conversion Documentation_"), in order to receive the Series A
Conversion Consideration.

 



 

In addition to delivery in accordance with the general notice provisions
contained in Section 16.1, the Series A Conversion Notice shall be deemed
properly delivered on the date the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership issues a press release distributed through a widely circulated
news or wire service as would satisfy the requirements of Regulation FD,
containing the information required to be included in the Series A Conversion
Notice pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(vii)(C). The date any Series A
Conversion Notice is deemed delivered shall be referred to as the " _Series A
Conversion Notice Date_."

 



 

D. As promptly as practicable following the Series A Conversion Notice Date
and subject to the book-entry provisions set forth below, the holders of
Series A Preferred Units shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing the Series A Preferred Units being converted, duly endorsed, at
the office of the Partnership or, if identified in the Series A Conversion
Notice to such holder by the Partnership, at the offices of any Transfer Agent
for such Units, together with the Series A Conversion Documentation. As
promptly as practicable following the receipt of such certificate or
certificates (or a lost unit affidavit reasonably acceptable to the
Partnership in the event of a lost certificate) representing the Series A
Preferred Units and the Series A Conversion Documentation by the Partnership
or the Transfer Agent as provided in the immediately preceding sentence (but
in any event no later than five Business Days thereafter), the Partnership
shall issue to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of
Common Units to which such holder shall be entitled under Section
5.8(b)(vii)(A) (with the number of and denomination of such certificates
designated by such holder). In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Units issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred
Units, provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the DepositoryÂ’s Fast
Automated Securities Transfer program, upon request of the holder, the
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Common Units issuable upon
conversion to the holder, by crediting the account of the holderÂ’s prime
broker with the Depository through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission
(DWAC) system. The holders of Series A Preferred Units and the Partnership
agree to coordinate with the Depository to accomplish this objective. The
conversion pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(vii) shall be deemed to have
occurred immediately prior to the close of business on the Series A Maturity
Date (whether or not the conversion includes the right to receive Series A
Cash Consideration under Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A)(b) or Fractional Unit Cash
Consideration under Section 5.8(b)(vii)(G)). The Person or Persons entitled to
receive the Common Units issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for
all purposes as the Record Holder or Holders of such Common Units at the close
of business on the Series A Maturity Date.

 



      
 

 



 

E. If the Partnership (i) elects to have the Series A Preferred Units convert
into both Common Units and the right to receive the Series A Conversion Cash
Consideration under Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A)(b) or (ii) is required to pay
Fractional Unit Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(G), then,
as promptly as practicable following the receipt of such certificate or
certificates (or a lost unit certificate affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Partnership in the event of a lost certificate) representing the Series A
Preferred Units and the Series A Conversion Documentation by the Partnership
or the Transfer Agent as provided in the first sentence of Section
5.8(b)(vii)(D) (but in any event within five Business Days thereafter), the
Partnership shall remit the Series A Cash Conversion Consideration and the
Fractional Unit Cash Consideration, as applicable, to the holder surrendering
such certificate or certificates (or a lost unit affidavit reasonably
acceptable to the Partnership in the event of a lost certificate) representing
Series A Preferred Units by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by such holder in writing.

 



 

F. The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise or similar taxes, that may be payable
in respect of any issue or delivery of Common Units on conversion of, or
payment of distributions on, Series A Preferred Units pursuant hereto.
However, the holder of any Series A Preferred Units shall pay any tax that is
due because the Common Units issuable upon conversion thereof or distribution
payment thereon are issued in a name other than such holderÂ’s name.

 



 

G. No fractional Common Units shall be issued upon the conversion of any
Series A Preferred Units. All Common Units (including fractions thereof)
issuable upon conversion of more than one Series A Preferred Unit by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion
would result in the issuance of any fractional unit. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a
fraction of a Common Unit, the Partnership shall, in lieu of issuing any
fractional unit, either round up the number of units to the next highest whole
number or, at the PartnershipÂ’s option, pay the holder otherwise entitled to
such fraction a sum in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the VWAP
Price as of the Series A Maturity Date. The consideration payable in lieu of
fractional Common Units pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(vii)(G) as well as any
consideration payable in lieu of fractional Common Units pursuant to Section
5.8(b)(viii)(F), are referred to as " _Fractional Unit Cash Consideration_."

 



      
 

 



 

H. The Partnership shall not be obligated to issue any Common Units upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Units, whether pursuant to this Section
5.8(b)(vii), or otherwise, if the issuance of such Common Units would exceed
the Series A Exchange Cap or if such issuance could reasonably be expected to
violate any applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities
commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over such
issuance (a " _Securities Law Prohibition_ "). To the extent that a holderÂ’s
Series A Preferred Units would otherwise be converted into a number of Common
Units that would exceed the Series A Exchange Cap, the Partnership shall pay
in cash to such holder an amount equal to the VWAP Price as of the Series A
Maturity Date multiplied by the number of Common Units that are not so issued
but would otherwise be issuable as part of the Series A Conversion
Consideration absent such Series A Exchange Cap or Securities Law Prohibition.

 



 

I. Any Common Units issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Units
pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(vii) shall not be subject to the first proviso
contained in the definition of "Outstanding" contained in this Agreement for
so long as held by the Investor.

 



 

(viii) _Optional Redemption_.

 



 

A. Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 5.8(b)(xi) and (xii),
beginning on the Series A Optional Redemption Trigger Date and ending on the
last Business Day immediately prior to the Series A Maturity Date, the
Partnership may, at its option, cause all, but not less than all, of the
Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed by the Partnership for (a) cash in an
amount per Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit equal to the Series A
Liquidation Value on the Series A Redemption Date plus (b) a number of Common
Units per Outstanding Series A Preferred Units equal to (i) the greater of (x)
the Series A Accretion Amount on the Series A Redemption Date and (y) $10.00
(such cash amount, the " _Series A Redemption Consideration_") divided by
(ii) the VWAP Price as of the Series A Redemption Date.

 



 

B. Any Common Units received by a holder of Series A Preferred Units as the
Series A Redemption Consideration shall be fully paid, validly issued and non-
assessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act). At the
time of the redemption pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(viii), all Series A
Preferred Units shall be converted automatically into and shall

 



      
 

 



 

thereafter represent solely the right to receive the Series A Redemption
Consideration. All such Series A Preferred Units that have converted into the
right to receive the Series A Redemption Consideration shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of redeemed Series A
Preferred Units shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Series A
Preferred Units other than the right to receive the Series A Redemption
Consideration. Upon such conversion, any certificates representing Series A
Preferred Units shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive the
Series A Redemption Consideration.

 



 

C. To redeem Series A Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(viii),
the Partnership shall:

 



 

a. no earlier than 30 days nor later than two days prior to the Series A
Redemption Date, send a written notice (the " _Series A Redemption Notice_")
to each holder of record of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units as of the
date of such notice stating that the Series A Preferred Units will be redeemed
pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(viii) effective as of the date set forth in
the Series A Redemption Notice (the " _Series A Redemption Date_"); and

 



 

b. as promptly as practicable following the Series A Redemption Date, send a
written notice (a " _Series A Redemption Confirmation_") to each holder of
record of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units as of the Series A Redemption
Date stating: (i) that the Series A Preferred Units have been redeemed
pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(viii) effective as of the Series A Redemption
Date; (ii) the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the amount of Series A Redemption
Consideration to be paid in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit pursuant
to Section 5.8(b)(viii)(A) (including any adjustments pursuant to Sections
5.8(b)(xi) and (xii)), including the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the Series A
Liquidation Value, the Series A Accretion Amount and the VWAP Price, in each
case as of the Series A Redemption Date; and (iii) that such holder must
surrender the certificate or certificates representing any Series A Preferred
Units held by such holder to the Partnership and provide such other
documentation as reasonably requested by the General Partner including wire
transfer instructions in respect of the Series A Redemption Consideration (the
" _Series A Redemption Documentation_"), in order to receive the Series A
Redemption Consideration. In addition to delivery in accordance with the
general notice provisions contained in Section 16.1, the Series A

 



      
 

 



 

Redemption Notice and/or a Series A Redemption Confirmation shall be deemed
properly delivered on the date the Partnership issues a press release
distributed through a widely circulated news or wire service as would satisfy
the requirements of Regulation FD, containing the information required to be
included in the Series A Redemption Notice pursuant to this Section
5.8(b)(viii)(C).

 



 

D. As promptly as practicable following the Series A Redemption Date, the
holders of Series A Preferred Units shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing the Series A Preferred Units being redeemed, duly
endorsed, at the office of the Partnership or, if identified in the Series A
Redemption Notice to such holder by the Partnership, at the offices of any
Transfer Agent for such Units, together with the Series A Redemption
Documentation. As promptly as practicable following the receipt of such
certificate or certificates (or a lost unit affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Partnership in the event of a lost certificate) representing the Series A
Preferred Units and the Series A Conversion Documentation by the Partnership
or the Transfer Agent as provided in the immediately preceding sentence (but
in any event no later than five Business Days thereafter), the Partnership
shall:

 



 

a. issue to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of Common
Units to which such holder shall be entitled under Section 5.8(b)(viii)(A)
(with the number of and denomination of such certificates designated by such
holder). In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common
Units issuable upon redemption of Series A Preferred Units, provided the
Transfer Agent is participating in the DepositoryÂ’s Fast Automated Securities
Transfer program, upon request of the holder, the Partnership shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transfer Agent to electronically
transmit the Common Units issuable upon redemption to the holder, by crediting
the account of the holderÂ’s prime broker with the Depository through its
Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (DWAC) system. The holders of Series A
Preferred Units and the Partnership agree to coordinate with the Depository to
accomplish this objective; and

 



 

b. remit the applicable cash portion of the Series A Redemption Consideration
to the holder surrendering such certificate or certificates representing
Series A Preferred Units by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by such holder in writing. The redemption pursuant to this
Section 5.8(b)(viii) shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the close of business on the
Series A Redemption Date. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Common
Units issuable upon such redemption shall be treated for all purposes as the
Record Holder or Holders of such Common Units at the close of business on the
Series A Maturity Date.

 



 

E. The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise or similar taxes, that may be payable
in respect of any issue or delivery of Common Units on redemption of, or
payment of distributions on, Series A Preferred Units pursuant hereto.
However, the holder of any Series A Preferred Units shall pay any tax that is
due because the Common Units issuable upon redemption thereof or distribution
payment thereon are issued in a name other than such holderÂ’s name.

 



 

F. No fractional Common Units shall be issued upon the redemption of any
Series A Preferred Units. All Common Units (including fractions thereof)
issuable upon redemption of more than one Series A Preferred Unit by a holder
thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the redemption
would result in the issuance of any fractional unit. If, after the
aforementioned aggregation, the redemption would result in the issuance of a
fraction of a Common Unit, the Partnership shall, in lieu of issuing any
fractional unit, either round up the number of units to the next highest whole
number or, at the PartnershipÂ’s option, pay the holder otherwise entitled to
such fraction a sum in cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the VWAP
Price as of the Series A Redemption Date.

 



 

G. The Partnership shall not be obligated to issue any Common Units upon
redemption of the Series A Preferred Units, whether pursuant to this Section
5.8(b)(viii), or otherwise, if the issuance of such Common Units would exceed
the Series A Exchange Cap or if such issuance could reasonably be expected to
conflict with a Securities Laws Prohibition. To the extent that a holderÂ’s
Series A Preferred Units would otherwise be redeemed for a number of Common
Units that would exceed the Series A Exchange Cap, the Partnership shall pay
in cash to such holder an amount equal to the VWAP Price as of the Series A
Redemption Date multiplied by the number of Common Units that are not so
issued but would otherwise be issuable as part of the Series A Redemption
Consideration absent such Series A Exchange Cap or Securities Law Prohibition.

 



      
 

 



 

H. Any Common Units issued upon redemption of the Series A Preferred Units
pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(viii) shall not be subject to the first
proviso contained in the definition of "Outstanding" contained in this
Agreement for so long as held by the Investor.

 



 

(ix) _Fundamental Change_.

 



 

A. If on the earlier of the date (x) the Partnership enters into a definitive
agreement to consummate a Fundamental Change, (y) of the consummation of a
Fundamental Change or (z) of the declaration of a distribution by the MLP
described in subsection (vii) of the definition of Fundamental Change (the "
_Fundamental Change Trigger Date_ "), Investor holds, in the aggregate, at
least fifty percent (50%) of the Series A Preferred Units issued pursuant to
the Regency GP Purchase Agreement, then the Partnership will within 10
Business Days of such date send a written notice to the Investor stating the
nature of the Fundamental Change, including a description of the material
terms of the transaction constituting a Fundamental Change and, if the
Fundamental Change has not yet occurred, the date or expected date of
consummation. No later than 10 Business Days following delivery of the notice
provided for in the previous sentence (the " _Election Notice Period_ "), the
Investor may, in its sole discretion, deliver written notice to the
Partnership of its election, in its sole discretion, to:

 



 

a. upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in subsections (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) of the definition of Fundamental Change, require the
Partnership to redeem all of the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units pursuant
to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(a) (a " _Fundamental Change Forced Redemption
Election_ "); or

 



 

b. upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in subsections (v), (vi)
or (vii) of the definition of Fundamental Change, require the Partnership to
elect to convert or redeem the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to Section
5.8(b)(ix)(C).

 



 

If at any time the Investor does not hold, in the aggregate, at least fifty
percent (50%) of the Series A Preferred Units issued pursuant to the Regency
GP Purchase Agreement, then the provisions of this Section 5.8(b)(ix) shall
immediately cease to have any force or effect and the Investor and the holders
of Series A Preferred Units shall have no rights hereunder, regardless of
whether or not the

 



      
 

 



 

Investor subsequently acquires additional Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

B. Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in subsections (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) of the definition of Fundamental Change:

 



 

a. If the Investor timely makes a Fundamental Change Forced Redemption
Election, then the Partnership will redeem all of the Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units for cash and Common Units in an amount per Outstanding Series
A Preferred Unit equal to the Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration.

 



 

i. Subject to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(a)(ii), in connection with a redemption
pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(a), the Partnership will deliver notice
of the redemption, the Series A Preferred Units will be canceled, the
certificates representing Series A Preferred Units will be surrendered in
exchange for the issuance of Common Units and the cash portion of the
Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration and any Fractional Unit Cash
Consideration will be paid, each in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Section 5.8(b)(viii)(B)-(H), except that, for purposes of applying such
provisions to a redemption pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(a), (A) all
references to the "Series A Redemption Consideration" will mean the
"Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration," (B) all references to "Series A
Redemption Date" will mean the time immediately prior to the consummation of
the Fundamental Change, (C) all references to "Series A Redemption
Documentation" will mean "Fundamental Change Documentation," (D) the
Partnership must deliver the Series A Redemption Notice no later than two
Business Days following the later of the date of consummation of the
Fundamental Change and the expiration of the Election Notice Period and (E)
references to Section 5.8(b)(viii)(A) shall mean a redemption pursuant to this
Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(a).

 



 

ii. In the event the Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration Premium does
not consist of Common Units, the Partnership shall (i) make appropriate
provision, in the definitive transaction

 



       
 

 



 

document governing the Fundamental Change or otherwise, to ensure that the
holders of Series A Preferred Units receive the Fundamental Change Redemption
Consideration (including the Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration
Premium) reasonably promptly following such Fundamental Change upon the
surrender of their certificates representing Series A Preferred Units and (ii)
deliver reasonable notice of such provisions to the holders of Series A
Preferred Units (which notice may be delivered in a manner consistent with
that contemplated for delivery of a Series A Redemption Notice pursuant to
Section 5.8(b)(viii)(C)).

 



 

b. If the Investor does not timely make a Fundamental Change Forced Redemption
Election, then each Series A Preferred Unit Outstanding immediately prior to
the consummation of the Fundamental Change will automatically be converted
into the right to receive the Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration
pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(b).

 



 

i. In the event the Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration consists of
Common Units, the Partnership will deliver notice of the conversion, the
Series A Preferred Units will be canceled, the certificates representing
Series A Preferred Units will be surrendered in exchange for the issuance of
Common Units and Fractional Unit Cash Consideration will be paid, each in a
manner consistent with the provisions of Section 5.8(b)(vii)(B)-(I), except
that, for purposes of applying such provisions to a conversion pursuant to
this Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(b), (A) all references to the "Series A Conversion
Consideration" will mean the "Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration,"
(B) all references to the "Series A Maturity Date" will mean the time
immediately prior to the consummation of the Fundamental Change, (C) all
references to "Series A Conversion Documentation" will mean "Fundamental
Change Documentation," (D) the Partnership must deliver the Series A
Conversion Notice no later than two Business Days following the later of the
date of consummation of the Fundamental Change and the expiration of the
Election Notice Period, (E) Section

 



      
 

 



 

5.8(b)(vii)(C)(a) shall be inapplicable, (F) references to Section
5.8(b)(vii)(A) shall mean a conversion pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(B)(b)
and (G) Section 5.8(b)(vii)(H) shall apply to any Common Units that would
otherwise be issuable as a result of the Fundamental Change.

 



 

ii. In the event the Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration does not
consist of Common Units, the Partnership shall (i) make appropriate provision,
in the definitive transaction document governing the Fundamental Change or
otherwise, to ensure that the holders of Series A Preferred Units receive the
Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration reasonably promptly following such
Fundamental Change upon the surrender of their certificates representing
Series A Preferred Units and (ii) deliver reasonable notice of such provisions
to the holders of Series A Preferred Units (which notice may be delivered in a
manner consistent with that contemplated for delivery of a Series A Conversion
Notice pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(C)).

 



 

C.

 



 

a. Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in subsections (v), (vi)
or (vii) of the definition of Fundamental Change and the election of the
Investor to require the Partnership to elect to convert or redeem the Series A
Preferred Units pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C), the Partnership will,
within two Business Days following the later of the date of consummation of
the Fundamental Change and the expiration of the Election Notice Period,
deliver written notice to the holders of all Outstanding Series A Preferred
Units as of the date of consummation of such Fundamental Change, stating (i)
the PartnershipÂ’s election to either (x) convert each of the Series A
Preferred Units Outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the
Fundamental Change into, for each Series A Preferred Unit then Outstanding,
the right to receive a number of Common Units equal to (A) the Series A
Liquidation Value on the date of consummation of the Fundamental Change
divided by (B) the VWAP Price as of the date of consummation of the
Fundamental Change (the " _Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit
Consideration_ ") or (y) redeem each of the Series A Preferred Units
Outstanding immediately prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

consummation of the Fundamental Change for an amount in cash per Series A
Preferred Unit then Outstanding equal to the Series A Liquidation Value on the
date of the consummation of the Fundamental Change (the " _Fundamental Change
Elected Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) the PartnershipÂ’s calculation of the
Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit Consideration or Fundamental Change
Elected Cash Consideration, as applicable, and (iii) that the holder must
surrender the certificate or certificates representing Series A Preferred
Units to the Partnership, together with the Fundamental Change Documentation,
in order to receive the Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit Consideration
or the Fundamental Change Elected Cash Consideration, as applicable. In
addition to delivery in accordance with the general notice provisions
contained in Section 16.1, any notice required to be delivered by the
Partnership pursuant to this section shall be deemed properly delivered on the
date the Partnership issues a press release distributed through a widely
circulated news or wire service as would satisfy the requirements of
Regulation FD, containing the information required to be included in such
notice.

 



 

b. In addition to the requirements of Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C)(a) and (c), upon
the declaration of a distribution by the MLP described in subsection (vii) of
the definition of Fundamental Change, the Partnership will promptly give
written notice to the Investor of such declaration and, if (x) the Investor
delivers written notice to the Partnership no later than two Business Days
after receipt of such notice from the Partnership and the Partnership elects
to issue the Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit Consideration pursuant to
Section 5.8(ix)(C)(a), then the Partnership shall cause such conversion to
occur prior to the Record Date for the distribution on the Common Units next
succeeding such election by the Partnership so that the Investor will be a
holder of Common Units as of such Record Date; or (y) if the Investor delivers
written notice to the Partnership no later than two Business Days after
receipt of such notice from the Partnership and the Partnership elects to
redeem the Series A Preferred Units for the Fundamental Change Elected Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 5.8(ix)(C)(a), then the Partnership shall
cause such redemption to occur prior to payment of the distribution in respect
of the PartnershipÂ’s Common Units for the Record Date for the distribution on
the Common Units next succeeding such election by the Partnership.

 



      
 

 



 

c. In the event the Partnership elects to convert the Series A Preferred Units
into the right to receive the Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit
Consideration, the Series A Preferred Units will be canceled, the certificates
representing Series A Preferred Units will be surrendered in exchange for the
issuance of Common Units and the Fractional Unit Cash Consideration, if any,
will be paid, each in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.8(b)(vii)(B)-(I), except that, for purposes of applying such provisions to a
conversion pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C)(a)(i)(x), (A) all references to
the "Series A Conversion Consideration" will mean the "Fundamental Change
Elected Common Unit Consideration," (B) all references to the "Series A
Maturity Date" will mean the time immediately prior to the consummation of the
Fundamental Change, (C) all references to "Series A Conversion Documentation"
will mean "Fundamental Change Documentation," (D) Section 5.8(b)(vii)(C)(a)
shall be inapplicable, (E) references to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A) shall mean a
conversion pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C)(a)(i)(x) and (F) Section
5.8(b)(vii)(H) shall apply to any Common Units that would otherwise be
issuable as a result of the Fundamental Change.

 



 

d. In the event the Partnership elects to redeem the Series A Preferred Unit
for the Fundamental Change Elected Cash Consideration, the Series A Preferred
Units will be canceled, the certificates representing Series A Preferred Units
will be surrendered and the Fundamental Change Elected Cash Consideration will
be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.8(b)(viii)(B)-(H),
except that, for purposes of applying such sections to a redemption pursuant
to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C)(a)(i)(y) (A) all references to the "Series A
Redemption Consideration" will mean the "Fundamental Change Elected Cash
Consideration," (B) all references to "Series A Redemption Date" will mean the
time immediately prior to the consummation of the Fundamental Change and (C)
all references to "Series A Redemption Documentation" will mean "Fundamental
Change Documentation" and (D) references to Section 5.8(b)(viii)(A) shall mean
a redemption pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C)(a)(i)(y).

 



 

D. If any Fundamental Change that is contemplated by a definitive agreement is
not consummated and therefore the conditions to the applicable redemption or
exchange pursuant to this Section 5.8(b)(ix) have not been satisfied, the
Partnership will send written

 



      
 

 



 

notice to such effect to the Investor (which notice may be delivered in a
manner consistent with that contemplated for delivery of a Series A Conversion
Notice pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii)(C)). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if a Fundamental Change is not consummated, no
Series A Preferred Units will be redeemed or converted pursuant to this
Section 5.8(b)(ix).

 



 

(x) _Limitations on Transfer_. Series A Preferred Units may only be
transferred to one or more transferees that, after giving effect to such
transfer, each hold at least 1,000,000 Series A Preferred Units, _provided_
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any transfer of Series A
Preferred Units to (i) the holders of the class B units in Regency GP Seller
of up to eight percent (8%) of the Series A Preferred Units or (ii) Regency GP
Seller and its Affiliates. In addition, a Unitholder holding a Series A
Preferred Unit that has converted into a Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.8
shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer imposed by Section 6.4(b).
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 5.8(b)(x) shall
in any way affect the restrictions on transfers of Partnership Interests
contained in Section 4.7, which shall apply to transfers of Series A Preferred
Units.

 



 

(xi) _Extraordinary Partnership Transactions_.

 



 

A. Except to the extent that any such event is a Fundamental Change as a
result of which the Series A Preferred Units are redeemed or converted
pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix), prior to the consummation of a Partnership
Event, the Partnership shall make appropriate provision to ensure that the
holders of Series A Preferred Units receive in such Partnership Event a
preferred security, issued by the Person surviving or resulting from such
Partnership Event and containing provisions substantially equivalent to the
provisions set forth in this Section 5.8 without abridgement, including,
without limitation, the same powers, preferences, rights to distributions,
rights to accumulation upon failure to pay distributions, and relative
participating, optional or other special rights and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series A Preferred Units had
immediately prior to such Partnership Event, subject to the adjustments
described in Section 5.8(b)(xi)(B) and Section 5.8(b)(xi)(C).

 



 

B. If in connection with a Partnership Event the Common Units are converted in
whole or in part into other Marketable Securities (such securities the "
_Successor Securities_ " and such event, a " _Public Equity Partnership Event_
"), then, following the Partnership Event Consummation Date, (i) upon the
conversion of the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii),
the redemption of the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to Section
5.8(b)(viii), or the redemption or conversion of the Series A

 



      
 

 



 

Preferred Units pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix), any portion of the Series A
Conversion Consideration, the Series A Redemption Consideration, the
Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration, the Fundamental Change Conversion
Consideration or the Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit Consideration, as
applicable, that would otherwise consist of Common Units pursuant to the terms
of Section 5.8(b)(vii), 5.8(b)(viii) or 5.8(b)(ix), as applicable, shall
instead consist of Successor Securities, (ii) references in Sections
5.8(b)(ii)(B), 5.8(b)(vii), 5.8(b)(viii), 5.8(b)(ix), 6.4(a) and 6.4(b) to
"Common Units" shall refer to the Successor Securities and (iii) the term "
_Trading Price Accretion Percentage_ " shall be modified to mean an amount
equal to (a) the Combined Accretion Multiple less (b) 1.00. The " _Combined
Accretion Multiple"_ shall mean an amount equal to the product of:

 



 

a. a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the VWAP Price of the Common
Units as of the Partnership Event Consummation Date and (ii) the denominator
of which is the VWAP Price of the Common Units as of the Series A Issuance
Date (the " _Pre-Partnership Event Accretion Multiple_ "); multiplied by

 



 

b. a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the VWAP Price of the Successor
Securities as of the Series A Conversion Date, the Series A Redemption Date or
the date of consummation of the Fundamental Change, as applicable and (ii) the
denominator of which is the VWAP Price of the Successor Securities as of the
eleventh Trading Day following the Partnership Event Consummation Date (the "
_Post-Partnership Event Accretion Multiple_ "),

 



 

 _provided_ that, if the foregoing product is less than 1.00, then the
Combined Accretion Multiple shall equal 1.00.

 



 

C. If in connection with a Partnership Event the Common Units do not remain
Outstanding and are converted solely into cash or other assets or securities
that do not constitute Marketable Securities (or any combination thereof),
then following such Partnership Event Consummation Date, upon the conversion
of the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(vii), the
redemption of the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(viii),
or the redemption or conversion of the Series A Preferred Units pursuant to
Section 5.8(b)(ix):

 



 

a. any portion of the Series A Conversion Consideration, the Series A
Redemption Consideration, the Fundamental

 



      
 

 



 

Change Redemption Consideration, the Fundamental Change Conversion
Consideration or the Fundamental Change Elected Common Unit Consideration, as
applicable, that would otherwise consist of Common Units pursuant to the terms
of Section 5.8(b)(vii), 5.8(b)(viii) or 5.8(b)(ix), as applicable, shall
instead be payable solely in cash;

 



 

b. the Series A Conversion Consideration or the Series A Redemption
Consideration, as applicable, shall be an amount equal to the Series A
Liquidation Amount as of the Series A Maturity Date or the Series A Redemption
Date, as applicable, plus:

 



 

i. in the event of a redemption, the greater of (i) the Series A Accretion
Amount as of the Partnership Event Consummation Date and (ii) $10.00; or

 



 

ii. in the event of a conversion, the lesser of (i) the Series A Accretion
Amount as of the Partnership Event Consummation Date and (ii) $10.00;

 



 

c. the term " _Fundamental Change Redemption Consideration Premium_ " shall be
modified to mean an amount in cash equal to the greater of (i) the Series A
Accretion Amount as of the date of the Partnership Event Consummation Date and
(ii) $10.00;

 



 

d. the term " _Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration_ " shall be
modified to mean an amount in cash equal to the Series A Liquidation Value as
of the date of the consummation of the Fundamental Change plus the lesser of
(i) the Series A Accretion Amount as of the Partnership Event Consummation
Date and (ii) $10.00; and

 



 

e. the Partnership will no longer have the option to convert the Series A
Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(ix)(C), but
instead must convert them into the right to receive the Fundamental Change
Elected Cash Consideration.

 



 

(xii) Distributions, Combinations and Subdivisions; Other Adjustments.

 



 

A. If, after the Series A Issuance Date and prior to the earlier of the Series
A Maturity Date and the Series A Redemption Date, the Partnership (a) makes a
distribution on its Common Units in Common Units, (b) subdivides or splits its
Common Units into a greater number of Common Units, (c) combines or
reclassifies its

 



      
 

 



 

Common Units into a smaller number of Common Units, (each of the events
described in clauses (a) through (c), a " _Series A Adjustment Event_") or
(d) makes a distribution on its Common Units in any property other than cash
or Common Units (a " _Special Distribution_ "), then calculation of the Series
A Conversion Consideration and the Series A Redemption Consideration shall be
adjusted as provided in this Section 5.8(b)(xii)(A) and Sections
5.8(b)(xii)(C) and (D).

 



 

a. Solely for the purposes of determining the Trading Price Accretion
Percentage for purposes of Section 5.8(b)(vii)(A) (in the event of a
conversion) or Section 5.8(b)(viii)(A) (in the event of a redemption):

 



 

i. for each Series A Adjustment Event, the VWAP Price as of the Series A
Maturity Date or the Series A Redemption Date, as applicable, shall be
adjusted by multiplying such VWAP Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of
which shall be the number of Common Units Outstanding immediately following
such Series A Adjustment Event and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the
number of Common Units Outstanding immediately prior to such Series A
Adjustment Event; and

 



 

ii. for each Special Distribution, the VWAP Price as of the Series A Maturity
Date or the Series A Redemption Date, as applicable, shall be adjusted by
adding to such VWAP Price the Fair Market Value of the property distributed on
a Common Unit in such Special Distribution.

 



 

b. Solely for the purposes of determining the Trading Price Accretion
Percentage for purposes of Section 5.8(b)(xi)(C) (in the event of conversion
or redemption following a Partnership Event Consummation Date) and determining
the Pre-Partnership Event Accretion Multiple pursuant to Section
5.8(b)(xi)(B)(a):

 



 

i. for each Series A Adjustment Event prior to the Partnership Event
Consummation Date, the VWAP Price as of the Partnership Event Consummation
Date shall be adjusted by multiplying such VWAP Price by a fraction, (i) the
numerator of which shall be the number of Common Units Outstanding immediately
following such Series A Adjustment Event and (ii) the denominator of which
shall be the

 



      
 

 



 

number of Common Units Outstanding immediately prior to such Series A
Adjustment Event; and

 



 

ii. for each Special Distribution prior to the Partnership Event Consummation
Date, the VWAP Price as of the Partnership Event Consummation Date shall be
adjusted by adding to such VWAP Price the Fair Market Value of the property
distributed on a Common Unit in such Special Distribution.

 



 

c. Solely for the purposes of determining the Post-Partnership Event Accretion
Multiple pursuant to Section 5.8(b)(xi)(B)(b):

 



 

i. for each Series A Adjustment Event following the Partnership Event
Consummation Date, the VWAP Price as of the Series A Maturity Date or the
Series A Redemption Date, as applicable, shall be adjusted by multiplying such
VWAP Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Successor Securities outstanding immediately following such Series A
Adjustment Event and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of
shares of Successor Securities outstanding immediately prior to such Series A
Adjustment Event; and

 



 

ii. for each Special Distribution following the Partnership Event Consummation
Date, the VWAP Price as of the Series A Maturity Date or the Series A
Redemption Date, as applicable, shall be adjusted by adding to such VWAP Price
the Fair Market Value of the property distributed on a share of Successor
Securities in such Special Distribution.

 



 

For purposes of this Section 5.8(b)(ix)(A)(c), references to "Common Units" in
the definitions of "Series A Adjustment Event" and "Special Distribution" set
forth in Section 5.8(b)(ix)(A) shall refer to Successor Securities.

 



 

B. If, after the Series A Issuance Date and prior to the date of the
consummation of a Fundamental Change, a Series A Adjustment Event or a Special
Distribution occurs, then the calculation of the Fundamental Change Redemption
Consideration or the Fundamental Change Conversion Consideration shall be
adjusted as provided in this Section 5.8(b)(xii)(B) and Sections

 



      
 

 



 

5.8(b)(xii)(C) and (D). Solely for the purposes of determining the Trading
Price Accretion Percentage for purposes of calculating the "Fundamental Change
Conversion Consideration" (in the event of a conversion) or the "Fundamental
Change Redemption Consideration" (in the event of a redemption):

 



 

a. for each Series A Adjustment Event, the VWAP Price as of the date of the
consummation of a Fundamental Change shall be adjusted by multiplying such
VWAP Price by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of
Common Units Outstanding immediately following such Series A Adjustment Event
and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Units
Outstanding immediately prior to such Series A Adjustment Event; and

 



 

b. for each Special Distribution, the VWAP Price as of the date of the
consummation of a Fundamental Change shall be adjusted by adding to such VWAP
Price the Fair Market Value of the property distributed on a Common Unit in
such Special Distribution.

 



 

C. Subsequent adjustments to the applicable VWAP Price shall be made
successively in the order of occurrence of any Series A Adjustment Event or
Special Distribution whenever more than one Series A Adjustment Event or
Special Distribution occurs during an applicable period.

 



 

D. If a Partnership Event, a Series A Adjustment Event or a Special
Distribution occurs during a ten Trading Day period used for purposes of
calculating a VWAP Price as of any particular date under any provision of this
Agreement, the Partnership shall make appropriate adjustments to the VWAP
Price to insure that the VWAP Price properly reflects the value of the Common
Units or Successor Securities, as applicable, as of any particular date.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Establishment of Series B Units._

 



 

(a) _General._ The General Partner hereby designates and creates a series of
Units to be designated as "Series B Units" and consisting of a total of
Series B Units, having the same rights, preferences and privileges, and
subject to the same duties and obligations, as the Common Units, except as set
forth in this Section 5.9 and in Section 5.3(d)(i), Section 6.5 and Section
12.10. The class of Series B Units shall be closed immediately following the
Series B Issuance Date and thereafter no additional Series B Units shall be
designated, created or issued without the prior written approval of the
General Partner and the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series B
Units.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Rights of Series B Units. _The Series B Units shall have the following
rights, preferences and privileges and shall be subject to the following
duties and obligations:

 



 

(i) _Allocations_. Items of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall
be allocated to the Series B Units for each taxable year (or portion thereof)
in the manner set forth in Section 6.1(e).

 



 

(ii) _Distributions_.

 



 

A. Commencing on the Series B Issuance Date, the holders of the Series B Units
as of an applicable Record Date shall accrue and be entitled (except as
provided in subclause (V) below) to receive cash distributions, Ratably, with
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, in an amount equal to the
Series B Distribution Rate on each Outstanding Series B Unit. All such
distributions shall be paid Quarterly within 50 days after the end of each
Quarter (a " _Series B Distribution Payment Date_"). If the Partnership fails
to pay in full in cash any distribution (or portion thereof) which any holder
of Series B Units is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
5.9(b)(ii)(A), then (I) the Partnership shall not make any distribution on
Common Units or any other Series B Junior Security with respect to the Quarter
for which the Partnership has so failed to pay such distribution on the Series
B Units, (II) the amount of such accrued and unpaid distributions per Series B
Unit will accumulate and be added to the Series B Liquidation Value, (III) the
Partnership shall not be permitted to, and shall not, increase the per Unit
distributions payable on the Common Units for any Quarter above the per Unit
distributions paid on the Common Units for the most recent Quarter prior to
such non-payment on the Series B Units for so long as such accrued and unpaid
distributions on Series B Units remain unpaid, (IV) the Partnership shall not
be permitted to, and shall not, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any
Series A Preferred Units, any Series B Parity Securities or any Series B
Junior Securities, and (V) in any subsequent Quarter as to which the
Partnership has Available Cash remaining after taking into account the amount
of distributions to be paid with respect to the Series A Preferred Units at
the Series A Distribution Rate, the Series B Units at the Series B
Distribution Rate and the Common Units at the per Unit distribution amount
paid on the Common Units for the most recent Quarter prior to such non-payment
on the Series B Units, then the Partnership shall distribute such remaining
Available Cash with respect to the Series B Units until all cumulative unpaid
amounts on the Series B Units have been paid, and any distributions so made
with respect to the Series B Units shall reduce the Series B Liquidation Value
by the amount of the cash distribution per Series B Unit made pursuant to this
clause (V).

 



      
 

 



 

B. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.9(b)(ii) to the contrary, with
respect to Series B Units that are converted into or exchanged for Common
Units or MLP Common Units, as the case may be, the holder thereof shall not be
entitled to a Series B Unit distribution and a Common Unit or MLP Common Unit
distribution with respect to the same period, but shall be entitled only to
the distribution to be paid based upon the class of units held as of the close
of business on the Record Date for the distribution in respect of such period.

 



 

(iii) _Issuance of Series B Units_. The Series B Units shall be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Sigma Merger
Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Liquidation Value_. The rights, preferences and privileges of the Series
B Units in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Partnership, either voluntary or involuntary, are set forth in Section 12.10.

 



 

(v) _Voting Rights_.

 



 

A. In addition to the class vote of Series B Units provided in Section
5.9(b)(xii), the Series B Units shall vote as Common Units on an "as if"
converted basis.

 



 

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights
granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the Outstanding Series B Units, voting separately as a class with one vote per
Series B Unit, shall be necessary to amend this Agreement in any manner, by
merger or otherwise, that (i) alters or changes the rights, preferences or
privileges or duties and obligations of the Series B Units, (ii) increases or
decreases the authorized number of Series B Units (including without
limitation any issuance of additional Series B Units), or (iii) otherwise
adversely affects the Series B Units in any material respect, including
without limitation the creation or issuance (by reclassification or otherwise)
of any class of Series B Senior Securities (or amending the provisions of any
existing class of Partnership Securities to make such class of Partnership
Securities a class of Series B Senior Securities) unless permitted to do so by
Section 5.9(b)(xii); _provided, however_ , that, except as provided in Section
5.9(b)(v)(A), the Partnership may, without the consent or approval of the
holders of the Series B Units (a) create (by reclassification or otherwise)
and issue Series B Junior Securities (including by amending the provisions of
any existing class of Partnership Securities to make such class of Partnership
Securities a class of Series B Junior Securities) in an unlimited amount and
(b) consummate any Fundamental Change provided

 



      
 

 



 

that in connection with such Fundamental Change, to the extent applicable, the
holders of the Series B Units are entitled to the rights provided in the last
sentence of Section 5.9(b)(xii).

 



 

(vi) _Certificates; Book-Entry_. The Series B Units shall be evidenced by
certificates in such form as the General Partner may approve and, subject to
the satisfaction of any applicable legal, regulatory and contractual
requirements, may be assigned or transferred in a manner identical to the
assignment and transfer of other Units; unless and until the General Partner
determines to assign the responsibility to another Person, the General Partner
will act as the registrar and transfer agent for the Series B Units. The
certificates evidencing Series B Units shall be separately identified and
shall not bear the same CUSIP number as the certificates evidencing Common
Units. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Series B
Units, provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the DepositoryÂ’s Fast
Automated Securities Transfer program, upon request of the holder, the
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series B Units to the holder, by
crediting the account of the holderÂ’s prime broker with the Depository through
its DWAC system. The holders of Series B Units and the Partnership agree to
coordinate with the Depository to accomplish this objective.

 



 

(vii) _Conversion and Exchange_.

 



 

A. The holder of an Outstanding Series B Unit may, at its option, convert its
Series B Units under any one or more of the following clauses (1), (2) or (3),
to the extent applicable, on and subject to the terms set forth in this
Section 5.9(b)(vii):

 



 

(1) If, at any time, the Partnership proposes to make a Common Unit
distribution in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) greater than the average
of the quarterly Common Unit distributions made during the preceding four
calendar quarters (an "Extraordinary Distribution"), then (i) the Partnership
shall notify holders of Series B Units 30 days prior to the Record Date for
such Extraordinary Distribution and (ii) such holders shall have the option to
convert their Series B Units prior to the Record Date for such Extraordinary
Distribution into the number of Common Units determined in accordance with the
last paragraph of this Section 5.9(b)(vii)(A).

 



 

(2) From and after the first anniversary of the Series B Issuance Date, the
holder of an Outstanding Series B Unit may convert (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(viii)(E) in connection with an issuance
of a Series B Redemption Notice to such holder), upon the satisfaction of the
terms and conditions of this Section 5.9(b)(vii), the Series B Units held by
such holder into the

 



      
 

 



 

number of Common Units determined in accordance with the last paragraph of
this Section 5.9(b)(vii)(A).

 



 

(3) The holder of an Outstanding Series B Unit may convert, pursuant to
Section 5.9(b)(viii)(E) in connection with an issuance of a Series B
Redemption Notice to such holder, the Series B Units held by such holder that
would otherwise be subject to redemption pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(viii) into
the number of MLP Common Units determined in accordance with the last
paragraph of this Section 5.9(b)(vii)(A).

 



 

Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 5.9(b)(ix) and (x), the number
of Common Units or MLP Common Units, as applicable, issuable pursuant to a
conversion of Series B Units shall equal the product of (A) the number of
Series B Units to be converted, and (B) the Series B Conversion Rate
determined as of the Series B Conversion Notice Date. The consideration to be
received by the holder of a Series B Unit upon the conversion of such Series B
Unit as provided in this Section 5.9(b)(vii)(A) is referred to as the "
_Series B Conversion Consideration._"

 



 

B. Any Common Units or MLP Common Units received by a holder of Series B Units
as the Series B Conversion Consideration shall be fully paid, validly issued
and non-assessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act). All
Series B Units that have converted into the right to receive the Series B
Conversion Consideration shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist unless held by an Affiliate of the Partnership, in which case such units
shall remain Outstanding. The holders of converted Series B Units shall cease
to have any rights with respect to Series B Units that have converted into the
right to receive the Series B Conversion Consideration other than the right to
receive the Series B Conversion Consideration. Upon such conversion, any
certificates representing Series B Units shall thereafter represent solely the
right to receive the Series B Conversion Consideration.

 



 

C. The conversion rights of a holder of Series B Units under this Section
5.9(b)(vii) are exercisable by sending written notice in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit C_ (a " _Series B Conversion Notice_ **"** ) to the
Partnership setting forth the election of such holder to convert its Series B
Units into Common Units or MLP Common Units (as applicable). Within five
Business Days following the Series B Conversion Notice Date, the Partnership
shall send a written notice to such converting holder stating:

 



      
 

 



 

a. the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the Series B Conversion Consideration to
be paid in respect of each Series B Unit pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(vii)(A)
(including, in each case, any adjustments pursuant to Sections 5.9(b)(ix) and
(x)), including the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the Series B Liquidation
Value and, if applicable, the VWAP Price of MLP Common Units; and

 



 

b. that the holder must surrender the certificate or certificates representing
any Series B Units held by such holder to the Partnership, and provide such
other documentation as reasonably requested by the General Partner (the "
_Series B Conversion Documentation_"), in order to receive the Series B
Conversion Consideration.

 



 

D. As promptly as practicable following the Series B Conversion Notice Date
and subject to the book-entry provisions set forth in Section 5.9(b)(vi), the
holders of Series B Units shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing the Series B Units being converted, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Partnership or, if requested by the Partnership, at the offices of any
Transfer Agent, together with the Series B Conversion Documentation. As
promptly as practicable following the receipt of such certificate or
certificates (or a lost unit affidavit reasonably acceptable to the
Partnership in the event of a lost certificate) representing the Series B
Units and the Series B Conversion Documentation by the Partnership or the
Transfer Agent as provided in the immediately preceding sentence (but in any
event no later than five Business Days thereafter), the Partnership shall
provide to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of Common
Units or MLP Common Units to which such holder shall be entitled under Section
5.9(b)(vii)(A) (with the number of and denomination of such certificates
designated by such holder). In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Units or MLP Common Units upon conversion of Series B
Units, provided the Transfer Agent is participating in the DepositoryÂ’s Fast
Automated Securities Transfer program, upon request of the holder, the
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Common Units or MLP Common Units
issuable upon conversion to the holder, by crediting the account of the
holderÂ’s prime broker with the Depository through its DWAC system. The holders
of Series B Units and the Partnership agree to coordinate with the Depository
to accomplish this objective. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the
Common Units or MLP Common Units upon such conversion shall be treated for all
purposes as the Record Holder or

 



      
 

 



 

Holders of such Common Units or MLP Common Units at the close of business on
the Series B Conversion Notice Date.

 



 

E. If the Partnership is required to pay Series B Fractional Unit Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(vii)(G), then, as promptly as
practicable following the receipt of such certificate or certificates (or a
lost unit certificate affidavit reasonably acceptable to the Partnership in
the event of a lost certificate) representing the Series B Units and the
Series B Conversion Documentation by the Partnership or the Transfer Agent as
provided in the first sentence of Section 5.9(b)(vii)(D) (but in any event
within five Business Days thereafter), the Partnership shall remit the Series
B Fractional Unit Cash Consideration to the holder surrendering such
certificate or certificates (or a lost unit affidavit reasonably acceptable to
the Partnership in the event of a lost certificate) representing Series B
Units by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
by such holder in writing.

 



 

F. The Partnership shall pay any and all issue, documentary, stamp and other
taxes, excluding any income, franchise or similar taxes, that may be payable
in respect of any issue or delivery of Common Units or MLP Common Units on
conversion of, or payment of distributions on, Series B Units pursuant hereto.
However, the holder of any Series B Units shall pay any tax that is due
because the Common Units or MLP Common Units received upon conversion thereof
or distribution payment thereon are issued in a name other than such holderÂ’s
name.

 



 

G. No fractional Common Units or MLP Common Units shall be delivered upon the
conversion of any Series B Units. All Common Units or MLP Common Units
(including fractions thereof) payable upon conversion of more than one Series
B Unit by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional unit.
If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the
delivery of a fraction of a Common Unit or MLP Common Unit, the Partnership
shall, in lieu of delivering any fractional unit, either round up the number
of units to the next highest whole number or, at the PartnershipÂ’s option, pay
the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to such
fraction multiplied by the VWAP Price of Common Units or of MLP Common Units,
as applicable, as of the Series B Conversion Notice Date. The consideration
payable in lieu of fractional Common Units or MLP Common Units pursuant to
this Section 5.9(b)(vii)(G) is referred to as " _Series B Fractional Unit
Cash Consideration_."

 



      
 

 



 

H. The Partnership may impose such procedures and requirements as are, in the
reasonable judgment of the General Partner, reasonably necessary to effectuate
and administer any conversion of Series B Units as provided herein.

 



 

I. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the effect that Series B
Units rank _pari passu_ with any other Partnership Security, no such provision
shall limit or otherwise diminish the rights of the holders of Series B Units
to convert to Common Units or MLP Common Units under this Section 5.9(b)(vii).

 



 

(viii) _Optional Redemption_.

 



 

A. Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 5.9(b)(ix) and (x), at any
time following the Series B Issuance Date, the Partnership may, at its option
and from time to time, cause all or a portion of the Series B Units to be
redeemed by the Partnership for cash in an amount per Outstanding Series B
Unit equal to the Series B Liquidation Value on the Series B Redemption Date
(such cash amount, the " _Series B Redemption Consideration_").

 



 

B. To redeem Series B Units pursuant to this Section 5.9(b)(viii), the
Partnership shall:

 



 

a. no earlier than 60 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Series B
Redemption Date, send a written notice (the " _Series B Redemption Notice_")
to each holder of record of Outstanding Series B Units as of the date of such
notice stating (i) that Series B Units will be redeemed, either in whole or in
part, pursuant to this Section 5.9(b)(viii) effective as of the date set forth
in the Series B Redemption Notice (the " _Series B Redemption Date_"), (ii)
if less than all of the Outstanding Series B Units will be redeemed by the
Partnership (a " _Series B Partial Redemption_"), each holder of record of
Outstanding Series B Units shall have the option of tendering all or a portion
of its Outstanding Series B Units in such redemption by providing written
notice to the Partnership not later than 15 days prior to the Series B
Redemption Date (the " _Series B Redemption Election Notice_"), and (iii) if
a holder of Series B Units elects to receive MLP Common Units pursuant to
Section 5.9(b)(viii)(E), the source of the MLP Common Units to be delivered to
such holder (which source may be MLP Common Units held by the Partnership,
newly issued MLP Common Units, or any other source, as determined by the
General Partner in its sole discretion); and

 



      
 

 



 

b. as promptly as practicable following the Series B Redemption Date, send a
written notice (a " _Series B Redemption Confirmation_") to each holder of
record of Outstanding Series B Units as of the Series B Redemption Date
stating: (i) that the Series B Units have been redeemed pursuant to this
Section 5.9(b)(viii) effective as of the Series B Redemption Date; (ii) the
PartnershipÂ’s computation of the amount of Series B Redemption Consideration
to be paid in respect of each Series B Unit pursuant to Section
5.9(b)(viii)(A) (including any adjustments pursuant to Sections 5.9(b)(ix) and
(x)), including the PartnershipÂ’s computation of the Series B Liquidation
Value as of the Series B Redemption Date; and (iii) that such holder must
surrender the certificate or certificates representing any Series B Units held
by such holder to the Partnership and provide such other documentation as
reasonably requested by the General Partner, including wire transfer
instructions in respect of the Series B Redemption Consideration (the "
_Series B Redemption Documentation_"), in order to receive the Series B
Redemption Consideration. In addition to delivery in accordance with the
general notice provisions contained in Section 16.1, the Series B Redemption
Notice and/or a Series B Redemption Confirmation shall be deemed properly
delivered on the date the Partnership issues a press release distributed
through a widely circulated news or wire service as would satisfy the
requirements of Regulation FD, containing the information required to be
included in the Series B Redemption Notice pursuant to this Section
5.9(b)(viii)(B).

 



 

C. As promptly as practicable following the Series B Redemption Date, the
holders of Series B Units shall surrender the certificate or certificates
representing the Series B Units being redeemed, duly endorsed, at the office
of the Partnership or, if identified in the Series B Redemption Notice to such
holder by the Partnership, at the offices of any Transfer Agent for such
Units, together with the Series B Redemption Documentation. As promptly as
practicable following the receipt of such certificate or certificates (or a
lost unit affidavit reasonably acceptable to the Partnership in the event of a
lost certificate) representing the Series B Units and the Series B Redemption
Documentation by the Partnership or the Transfer Agent as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence (but in any event no later than five Business
Days thereafter), the Partnership shall remit the Series B Redemption
Consideration to the holder surrendering such certificate or certificates
representing Series B Units by wire transfer of immediately available funds to

 



      
 

 



 

an account specified by such holder in writing. The redemption pursuant to
this Section 5.9(b)(viii) shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior
to the close of business on the Series B Redemption Date.

 



 

D. In the event of a Series B Partial Redemption, and the number of
Outstanding Series B Units tendered into the redemption exceeds the number of
Outstanding Series B Units being redeemed by the Partnership pursuant to the
Series B Redemption Notice, then the number of Outstanding Series B Units
being redeemed from each participating holder thereof will be reduced pro rata
based on the number of Outstanding Series B Units being tendered by each such
holder. In the event of a Series B Partial Redemption, and the number of
Outstanding Series B Units tendered into the redemption is less than the
number of Outstanding Series B Units being redeemed by the Partnership
pursuant to the Series B Redemption Notice (the " _Series B_ _Redemption
Deficit_ "), then the number of Outstanding Series B Units being redeemed from
each participating holder thereof will be equal to the number set forth for
such holder in the Series B Redemption Election Notice and Series B Redemption
Deficit shall be satisfied by Pro Rata redemption from all holders of Series B
Units after giving effect to the number of Outstanding Series B Units
previously tendered for redemption pursuant to the Series B Redemption
Election Notice.

 



 

E. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.9(b)(viii) to the contrary, if
the Partnership elects to exercise its rights under this Section 5.9(b)(viii):

 



 

(1) after the Series B Issuance Date and before the first anniversary of the
Series B Issuance Date, then holders of Series B Units may convert Series B
Units subject to redemption under this Section 5.9(b)(viii) into MLP Common
Units (but not Common Units) by following the procedures set forth in Section
5.9(b)(vii); _provided_ , that the Series B Conversion Notice must be received
by the Partnership no later than 15 days prior to the Series B Redemption
Date; and

 



 

(2) after the first anniversary of the Series B Issuance Date, the holders of
Series B Units may convert Series B Units subject to redemption under this
Section 5.9(b)(viii) into either Common Units or MLP Common Units by following
the procedures set forth in Section 5.9(b)(vii); _provided_ , that the Series
B Conversion Notice must be received by the Partnership not later than 15 days
prior to the Series B Redemption Date.

 



      
 

 



 

F. If at any time on or after the date that is 30 days prior to the beginning
of the Series B Conversion Election Period, a holder of Series B Units
requests in writing that the Partnership indicate the source of MLP Common
Units that would be transferred to such holder if such holder were to elect to
convert to MLP Common Units pursuant to this Section 5.9(b)(viii) (an " _MLP
Common Unit Source Request_ "), the Partnership shall notify such holder of
such source in writing within five Business Days following receipt of the MLP
Common Unit Source Request and shall be bound to deliver MLP Common Units from
such source if such holder delivers a Series B Conversion Notice within 30
days following such MLP Common Unit Source Request electing to convert Series
B Units held by such holder to MLP Common Units. Subject to the preceding
sentence, the source of such MLP Common Units may be MLP Common Units held by
the Partnership, newly issued MLP Common Units, or any other source.

 



 

(ix) _Extraordinary Partnership Transactions_.

 



 

A. Prior to a Partnership Event, the Partnership shall make appropriate
provision to ensure that the holders of Series B Units receive in such
Partnership Event a preferred security, issued by the Person surviving or
resulting from such Partnership Event and containing provisions substantially
equivalent to the provisions set forth in this Section 5.9 without
abridgement, including, without limitation, the same powers, preferences,
rights to distributions, rights to accumulation upon failure to pay
distributions, and relative participating, optional or other special rights
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series B
Units had immediately prior to such Partnership Event, subject to the
adjustments described in Section 5.9(b)(ix)(B) and Section 5.9(b)(ix)(C).

 



 

B. In the event of a Public Equity Partnership Event or an MLP Public Equity
Partnership Event, then, following the Partnership Event Consummation Date or
the MLP Event Consummation Date, as applicable, (i) upon the conversion of the
Series B Units pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(vii) or the redemption of the Series
B Units pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(viii), any portion of the Series B
Conversion Consideration or the Series B Redemption Consideration, as
applicable, that would otherwise consist of Common Units or MLP Common Units
pursuant to the terms of Section 5.9(b)(vii) or 5.9(b)(viii), as applicable,
shall instead consist of Successor Securities or MLP Successor Securities, as
applicable, and (ii) references in Sections 5.9(b)(ii)(B), 5.9(b)(vii),
5.9(b)(viii) and 6.5(a) to "Common Units" or "MLP Common

 



       
 

 



 

Units" shall refer to the Successor Securities or MLP Successor Securities, as
applicable.

 



 

C. If in connection with a Partnership Event or an MLP Event the Common Units
or the MLP Common Units do not remain Outstanding and are converted solely
into cash or other assets or securities that do not constitute Marketable
Securities (or any combination thereof), then following such Partnership Event
Consummation Date or the MLP Event Consummation Date, as applicable, upon the
conversion of the Series B Units pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(vii), any portion
of the Series B Conversion Consideration that would otherwise consist of
Common Units or MLP Common Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.9(b)(vii)
shall instead be payable solely in cash in an amount equal to the Series B
Liquidation Value.

 



 

(x) _Distributions, Combinations and Subdivisions; Other Adjustments_. If,
after the Series B Issuance Date and prior to the earlier of the Series B
Conversion Date and the Series B Redemption Date, the Partnership (a) makes a
distribution on its Common Units in Common Units, (b) subdivides or splits its
Common Units into a greater number of Common Units, (c) combines or
reclassifies its Common Units into a smaller number of Common Units, or (d)
makes a Special Distribution, then calculation of the Series B Conversion
Consideration (with respect to Common Units issuable upon conversion of the
Series B Units) and the Series B Redemption Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 



 

(xi) _Assignment_. The Partnership shall have the right to assign its rights
to redeem Series B Units under this Section 5.9 and its obligations under this
Section 5.9 to deliver MLP Common Units to one or more of its Affiliates,
provided that any such assignment shall not relieve the Partnership from its
obligations under this Section 5.9.

 



 

(xii) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, without
the approval of holders of a majority of the Outstanding Series B Units, for
so long as at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the Series B Units issued on
the Series B Issuance Date remain Outstanding (the "Series B Ownership
Threshold"), the General Partner shall not cause or permit the Partnership or
any member of the Partnership Group to create (by merger, reclassification or
otherwise) or issue Series B Senior Securities or Series B Parity Securities
(including by amending the provisions of any existing class of Partnership
Securities to make such class of Partnership Securities a class of Series B
Senior Securities or Series B Parity Securities). Once the number of Series B
Units issued on the Series B Issuance Date is less than the Series B Ownership
Threshold, no such approval of the holders of Outstanding Series B Units shall
be required to take the actions set forth in first sentence of this Section
5.9(b)(xii). The Partnership shall not effect a transaction in which the
Series B Units are converted, exchanged or cancelled, or in which the Common
Units are converted, exchanged or cancelled, including any amendment of this
Agreement, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, unless, in connection with such transaction, the
holders of the Series B Units are entitled to receive, in exchange for such
Series B Units, consideration equivalent in value in all material respects to
the Series B Liquidation Value.

 



      
 

 



 

(xiii) _Tax Indemnity_.

 



 

A. If after the Series B Issuance Date and prior to the fifth anniversary of
the Series B Issuance Date, ETE takes or causes to occur any Tax Acceleration
Event that results in the recognition by a Protected Holder of Protected
Holder Tax Gain, such Protected Holder shall be entitled to receive the
Protected Holder Indemnity Amount.

 



 

B. The Partnership shall provide written notification to each potentially
Protected Holder upon the occurrence of any action that could reasonably be
expected to lead to or result in a Tax Acceleration Event within 90 days of
the close of the calendar year in which such Tax Acceleration Event occurs.
Any potentially Protected Holder shall then have 60 days to return to the
Partnership proof that the holder is a Protected Holder together with such
other materials as the General Partner may reasonably require, including,
without limitation, evidence that such holder received Series B Units pursuant
to the terms of the Sigma Merger Agreement or otherwise satisfies the
definition of a Protected Holder. Upon the General PartnerÂ’s determination
that such proof is adequate to establish the holder as a Protected Holder, the
Partnership shall have 60 days to deliver to the Protected Holder its good
faith written notice of the Protected Holder Indemnity Amount. Receipt of any
such notice setting out the Protected Holder Indemnity Amount shall be
conclusive against the Protected Holder in all respects 20 days after receipt
by the Protected Holder of such notices and the Partnership shall promptly pay
the Protected Holder the Protected Holder Indemnity Amount, unless within such
20-day period the Protected Holder sends the Partnership a notice disputing
the amount of such claim. Such notice of dispute shall describe the basis for
any objection and the nature and amount of all errors the Protected Holder
believes exist in the PartnershipÂ’s calculation of the Protected Holder
Indemnity Amount. Upon receipt of any such notice of objection, both the
Partnership and the Protected Holder shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate
and arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution of such dispute with 30 days.
If a mutually acceptable resolution cannot be reached between the Partnership
and the Protected Holder within such 30-day period, the matter shall be
referred to a CPA Mediator. Within 30 days after the date of such referral,
the CPA Mediator shall render its decision with respect to the differences,
and such decision shall be final and binding on the Partnership and the
Protected Holder.

 



 

C. Section 5.9(b)(xiii)(A) shall have no further force and effect if the sum
of (a) the total number of Series B Units held by Protected

 



      
 

 



 

Holders and (b) the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the total number of
Common Units held by Protected Holders that were issued upon conversion of
Series B Units pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(vii) by (ii) the Series B Conversion
Rate with respect to Common Units, is less than the product of (x) twenty-five
percent (25%) and (y) the excess of (i) the total number of Series B Units
issued at the time of the closing of the transactions set forth in the Sigma
Merger Agreement over (ii) the total number of Series B Units redeemed
pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(viii).

 



 

D. Section 5.9(b)(xiii)(A) shall have no further force and effect upon the
occurrence of (a) a Partnership Event, including a Public Equity Partnership
Event, or (b) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership to a non-Affiliate (together with (a), collectively, a "Tax
Indemnity Event") with respect to a holder of Series B Units (including, for
this purpose, a holder of Common Units received upon conversion of such Series
B Units pursuant to Section 5.9(b)(vii)) who approves or consents to such Tax
Indemnity Event. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.9(xiii)(b)(D) to
the contrary, the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, waive the
application of this Section 5.9(xiii)(b)(D) with respect to a Tax Indemnity
Event.

 



 

E. All payments made to a Protected Holder of any Protected Holder Indemnity
Amounts shall be made in other than such Protected HolderÂ’s capacity as a
Limited Partner within the meaning of Code section 707.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_.

 



 

For purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of
the Partners among themselves, the PartnershipÂ’s items of income, gain, loss
and deduction (computed in accordance with Section 5.3(b)) shall be allocated
(subject to Section 6.1(e)) among the Partners in each taxable year (or
portion thereof) as provided herein below.

 



 

(a) _Net Income_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 6.1(d), Net Income for each taxable year and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income for such
taxable year shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests.

 



 

(b) _Net Losses_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 6.1(d), Net Losses for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and

 



      
 

 



 

deduction taken into account in computing Net Losses for such taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests; _provided_ that Net Losses shall not be allocated
pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) to the extent that such allocation would cause
any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at
the end of such taxable year (or increase any existing deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account), instead any such Net Losses shall be allocated to
Partners with positive Adjusted Capital Account balances in accordance with
their Percentage Interests until such positive Adjusted Capital Accounts are
reduced to zero, and thereafter to the General Partner.

 



 

(c) _Net Termination Gains and Losses_. After giving effect to the special
allocations set forth in Section 6.1(d), all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain or Net
Termination Loss for such taxable period shall be allocated in the same manner
as such Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss is allocated hereunder.
All allocations under this Section 6.1(c) shall be made after Capital Account
balances have been adjusted by all other allocations provided under this
Section 6.1 and after all distributions of Available Cash provided under
Section 6.3 have been made; _provided_ , _however_ , that solely for purposes
of this Section 6.1(c), Capital Accounts shall not be adjusted for
distributions made pursuant to Section 12.4.

 



 

(i) If a Net Termination Gain is recognized (or deemed recognized pursuant to
Section 5.3(d)), such Net Termination Gain shall be allocated among the
Partners in the following manner (and the Capital Accounts of the Partners
shall be increased by the amount so allocated in each of the following
subclauses, in the order listed, before an allocation is made pursuant to the
next succeeding subclause):

 



 

A. First, to each Partner having a deficit balance in its Capital Account, in
the proportion that such deficit balance bears to the total deficit balances
in the Capital Accounts of all Partners, until each such Partner has been
allocated Net Termination Gain equal to any such deficit balance in its
Capital Account; and

 



 

B. Second, to all Unitholders and to the General Partner, in accordance with
their relative Percentage Interests.

 



 

(ii) If a Net Termination Loss is recognized (or deemed recognized pursuant to
Section 5.3(d)), such Net Termination Loss shall be allocated among the
Partners in the following manner:

 



 

A. First, 100% to all Partners, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in respect
of each Unit then Outstanding has been reduced to zero; and

 



 

B. Second, the balance, if any, to the General Partner.

 



 

(d) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable period:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.
For purposes of this Section 6.1(d), each PartnerÂ’s Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required
hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations
pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) with respect to such taxable period (other
than an allocation pursuant to Sections 6.1(d)(v) and 6.1(d)(vi)). This
Section 6.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain
chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

(ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(d)(i)),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a
net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this Section 6.1(d), each PartnerÂ’s Adjusted Capital Account balance shall
be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall
be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to
this Section 6.1(d), other than Section 6.1(d)(i) and other than an allocation
pursuant to Sections 6.1(d)(v) and 6.1(d)(vi), with respect to such taxable
period. This Section 6.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of
items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

(iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly
receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible unless such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated
pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i) or (ii).

 



 

(iv) _Gross Income Allocations_. In the event any Partner has a deficit
balance in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable period in
excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner
is deemed obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items
of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such

 



      
 

 



 

excess as quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to
this Section 6.1(d)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent that such
Partner would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account as adjusted after
all other allocations provided for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively
made as if this Section 6.1(d)(iv) were not in this Agreement.

 



 

(v) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests. If the General Partner determines that the PartnershipÂ’s
Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the
safe harbor requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is authorized, upon notice to the
other Partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest
ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

 



 

(vi) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

 



 

(vii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among
the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

 



 

(viii) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(ix) _Redemption of Series A Preferred Units and/or Series B Units_.

 



 

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 6.1 (other than the Required
Allocations), with respect to any taxable period during which Series A
Preferred Units are redeemed pursuant to the terms of Section 5.8(b), each
Partner holding redeemed Series A Preferred Units shall be allocated items of
income, gain, loss and deduction in a manner that results as closely as
possible in the

 



      
 

 



 

Capital Account balance of each such Partner attributable to its redeemed
Series A Preferred Units immediately prior to such redemption (and after
taking into account any applicable Regulatory Allocations) to equal (i) the
amount of cash paid to such Partner in redemption of such Series A Preferred
Units, and (ii) the product of the number of Common Units received in the
redemption and the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit
(but only to the extent not otherwise achieved by operation of Section
5.3(d)(ii)).

 



 

B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 6.1 (other than the Required
Allocations), with respect to any taxable period during which Series B Units
are redeemed pursuant to the terms of Section 5.9(b), each Partner holding
redeemed Series B Units shall be allocated items of income, gain, loss and
deduction in a manner that results as closely as possible in the Capital
Account balance of each such Partner attributable to its redeemed Series B
Units immediately prior to such redemption (and after taking into account any
applicable Regulatory Allocations) to equal (i) the amount of cash paid to
such Partner in redemption of such Series B Units, and (ii) the product of the
number of Common Units received in the redemption and the Per Unit Capital
Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (but only to the extent not
otherwise achieved by operation of Section 5.3(d)).

 



 

(x) _Curative Allocation_.

 



 

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the
Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in
making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount
of items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner
pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated
to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations
and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this
Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations
relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except
to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and
(2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to
the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain. Allocations pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

this Section 6.1(d)(x)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required
Allocations to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations
will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.
Further, allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(x)(A) shall be deferred
with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the
extent the General Partner determines that such allocations are likely to be
offset by subsequent Required Allocations.

 



 

B. The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(x)(A) in whatever order is most likely to
minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(x)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such
economic distortions.

 



 

(xi) _Corrective Allocations_. In the event of any allocation of Additional
Book Basis Derivative Items or any Book-Down Event or any recognition of a Net
Termination _Loss_ , the following rules shall apply:

 



 

A. In the case of any negative adjustments to the Capital Accounts of the
Partners resulting from a Book-Down Event or from the recognition of a Net
Termination Loss, such negative adjustment (1) shall first be allocated, to
the extent of the Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments, in such a
manner, as determined by the General Partner, that to the extent possible the
aggregate Capital Accounts of the Partners will equal the amount that would
have been the Capital Account balance of the Partners if no prior Book-Up
Events had occurred, and (2) any negative adjustment in excess of the
Aggregate Remaining Net Positive Adjustments shall be allocated pursuant to
Section 6.1(c) hereof.

 



 

B. In making the allocations required under this Section 6.1(d)(xi), the
General Partner may apply whatever conventions or other methodology it
determines will satisfy the purpose of this Section 6.1(d)(xi).

 



 

(e) _Allocations to Series A Preferred Units and Series B Units_.

 



 

(i) Prior to making any allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(a), but after
giving effect to any special allocations required by Section 6.1(d), items of
gross income shall be allocated to all holders of Series A Preferred Units and
Series B Units, in proportion to the relative sum of the distributions to
which they become entitled during the taxable year (or portion thereof) under
Section 5.8(b)(ii) and Section 5.9(b)(ii), respectively, whether or not
actually distributed during such taxable year (or portion thereof), until the
Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each Outstanding Series A Preferred
Unit and Series B Unit is equal to the Series A Liquidation Value and Series B
Liquidation Value, respectively. No allocations of Net Income shall be made to
the holders of Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units pursuant to Section
6.1(a).

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.1(b), holders of
Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units shall not receive any allocation
pursuant to Section

 



      
 

 



 

6.1(b) unless and until the Adjusted Capital Accounts of all other Partners
have been reduced to zero, in which case, prior to allocating any remaining
Net Losses to the General Partner, Net Losses shall be allocated among the
Series A Preferred Units, as a class, and the Series B Units, as a class, in
the same ratio that the Series A Preferred Net Negative Termination Amount, if
any, bears to the Series B Net Negative Termination Amount, if any, until the
Adjusted Capital Accounts of the Series A Preferred Units and the Series B
Units have been reduced to their respective Liquidation Values, and,
thereafter, in such manner as to cause such respective Adjusted Capital
Account balances to continue to be in proportion to their respective
Liquidation Values until the Adjusted Capital Account balances of the holders
in respect of each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit and the Series B Unit
have been reduced to zero.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.1(c)(i), (x)
holders of Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units shall be allocated Net
Termination Gain in accordance with Section 6.1(c)(i)(A), but shall not
receive any allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i)(B) with respect to their
Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units, as applicable, and (y) following
any allocation made pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i)(A), and prior to any
allocation made pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(i)(B), any remaining Net
Termination Gain shall be allocated among the Series A Preferred Units, as a
class, and the Series B Units, as a class, in the same ratio that the Series A
Preferred Net Positive Termination Amount, if any, bears to the Series B Net
Positive Termination Amount, if any, until the Adjusted Capital Account in
respect of each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit or Series B Unit is equal
to its respective Liquidation Value.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.1(c)(ii), (x)
holders of Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units shall not receive any
allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(A) with respect to their Series A
Preferred Units or Series B Units, as applicable, and (y) following any
allocation made pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(A), and prior to any allocation
made pursuant to Section 6.1(c)(ii)(B), any remaining Net Termination Loss
shall be allocated among the Series A Preferred Units, as a class, and the
Series B Units, as a class, in the same ratio that the Series A Preferred Net
Negative Termination Amount, if any, bears to the Series B Net Negative
Termination Amount, if any, until the Adjusted Capital Accounts of the Series
A Preferred Units and the Series B Units have been reduced to their respective
Liquidation Values, and, thereafter, in such manner as to cause such
respective Adjusted Capital Account balances to continue to be in proportion
to their respective Liquidation Amounts until the Adjusted Capital Account
balances of the holders in respect of each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit
and the Series B Unit have been reduced to zero.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners
in the same manner as its correlative item of " _book_ " income, gain, loss or
deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.

 



 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) (A) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto
shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under Section
704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between the Agreed
Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and
(B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of " _book_ " gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section
6.1.

 



 

(ii) (A) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (1) first, be
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof
pursuant to Section 5.3(d)(i) or Section 5.3(d)(ii), and (2) second, in the
event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among
the Partners in a manner consistent with Section 6.2(b)(i)(A); and (B) any
item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted Property
shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative
item of " _book_ " gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.

 



 

(iii) The General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-3(d) to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities, except as otherwise
determined by the General Partner with respect to goodwill.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 5.3(a) and Section 5.3(d), for the proper
administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of
the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General
Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in
determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery
deductions; (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of
income (including, without limitation, gross income) or deductions; and (iii)
amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the
proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or
Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity
of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The
General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make
such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.1(c) only if
such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse
effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner
Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations
are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

 



 

(d) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of
an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized
appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-
Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the PartnershipÂ’s common basis
of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.167(c)-1(a)(6) or any successor regulations thereto. If
the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably
be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization
conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in
the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based
upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in
the PartnershipÂ’s property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such
aggregate

 



       
 

 



 

method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and amortization
conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of
any Limited Partner Interests, so long as such conventions would not have a
material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any
class or classes of Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(e) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and
to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have
been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

 



 

(f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the
Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that such allocations, once made, shall
be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into
account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the
Code.

 



 

(g) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, shall for
federal income tax purposes, be determined on an annual basis and prorated on
a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of
the National Securities Exchange on which the Units are then traded on the
first Business Day of each month; _provided_ , _however_ , that gain or loss
on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the Partnership or any other
extraordinary item of income or loss realized and recognized other than in the
ordinary course of business, as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the
National Securities Exchange on the first Business Day of the month in which
such gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General
Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation to
the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and the
regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of
Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee
has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with
Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by the General
Partner.

 



 

(i) If Capital Account balances are reallocated between the Partners in
accordance with Section 5.3(d)(i) hereof and Proposed Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4), beginning with the year of reallocation and
continuing until the allocations required are fully taken into account, the
Partnership shall make corrective allocations (allocations of items of gross
income or gain or loss or deduction for federal income tax purposes that do
not have a corresponding book allocation) to take into account the Capital
Account reallocation, as provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.3 _ __Requirement and Characterization of Distributions;
Distributions to Record Holders_.

 



 

(a) Within 50 days following the end of each Quarter commencing with the
Quarter ending on February 28, 2006, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash
with respect to such Quarter (other than cash distributed with respect to the
Series A Units and Series B Units) shall, subject to Section 17-607 of the
Delaware Act, be distributed in accordance with this Article VI by the
Partnership to the holders of Common Units in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests as of the Record Date selected by the General Partner.
All distributions required to be made under this Agreement shall be made
subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the
Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and distributed
solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section
12.4.

 



 

(c) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of,
or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners, as
a distribution of Available Cash to such Partners.

 



 

(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the PartnershipÂ’s liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Series A Preferred
Units._

 



 

(a) A Unitholder holding a Series A Preferred Unit that has converted into a
Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.8 shall be required to provide notice to the
General Partner of the transfer of the converted Series A Preferred Unit
within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following such transfer and (ii)
the last Business Day of the calendar year during which such transfer
occurred, unless (x) the transfer is to an Affiliate of the holder or (y) by
virtue of the application of Section 5.3(d)(i), the General Partner has
previously determined, based on advice of counsel, that the converted Series A
Preferred Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic
and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In
connection with the condition imposed by this Section 6.4, the General Partner
shall take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to the
converted Series A Preferred Unit in preparation for a transfer of such Units;
_provided, however_ , that no such steps may be taken that would have a
material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units represented by
Common Unit Certificates (for this purpose the allocations of income, gain,
loss and deductions with respect to Series A Preferred Units or Common Units
will be deemed not to have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders
holding Common Units).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) A Unitholder holding a Series A Preferred Unit that has converted into a
Common Unit pursuant to Section 5.8 shall not be permitted to transfer, by
assignment or otherwise, any such Common Unit until after 32 calendar days
have elapsed from the date that the Series A Preferred Unit was converted into
such Common Unit.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Series A Preferred Units (a) shall (i) possess the rights,
preferences and privileges and the duties and obligations provided in this
Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner pursuant to Article III and
Article VII and (ii) have a Capital Account as a Partner pursuant to Section
5.3 and all other provisions related thereto and (b) shall not (i) be entitled
to vote on any matters requiring the approval or vote of the holders of
Outstanding Units, except as provided in Section 5.8, (ii) be entitled to any
distributions other than as provided in Section 5.8, ARTICLE VI or ARTICLE VII
or (iii) be allocated items of income, gain, loss or deduction other than as
specified in Section 5.8 or Article VI.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Series B Units._

 



 

(a) A Unitholder holding a Series B Unit that has converted into a Common Unit
pursuant to Section 5.9 shall be required to provide notice to the General
Partner of the transfer of the converted Series B Unit within the earlier of
(i) thirty (30) days following such transfer and (ii) the last Business Day of
the calendar year during which such transfer occurred, unless (x) the transfer
is to an Affiliate of the holder or (y) by virtue of the application of
Section 5.3(d)(i), the General Partner has previously determined, based on
advice of counsel, that the converted Series B Unit should have, as a
substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax
characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. For the avoidance of doubt, the
General Partner acknowledges that by virtue of the application of Section
5.3(a) and Section 5.3(d), the requirements of this Section 6.5 should
generally be satisfied except in the case of a change in applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the condition imposed by
this Section 6.5, the General Partner shall take whatever steps are required,
based on advice of counsel, to provide economic uniformity to the converted
Series B Unit in preparation for a transfer of such Unit; _provided, however_
, that no such steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on
the Unitholders holding Common Units represented by Common Unit Certificates
(for this purpose the allocations of income, gain, loss and deductions with
respect to Series B Units or Common Units will be deemed not to have a
material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Series B Units (a) shall (i) possess the rights, preferences
and privileges and the duties and obligations provided in this Agreement with
respect to a Limited Partner pursuant to Article III and Article VII and (ii)
have a Capital Account as a Partner pursuant to Section 5.3 and all other
provisions related thereto and (b) shall not (i) be entitled to any
distributions other than as provided in Section 5.9, ARTICLE VI or ARTICLE VII
or (ii) be allocated items of income, gain, loss or deduction other than as
specified in Section 5.9 or Article VI.

pursuant to Article XV), shall not constitute a breach by the General Partner
of any duty that the General Partner may owe the Partnership or the Limited
Partners or any other Persons under this Agreement (or any other agreements)
or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Certificate of Limited Partnership_.

 



 

The General Partner has caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the
Delaware Act and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such
other certificates or documents that the General Partner determines to be
necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and
operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited
partners have limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state
in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the
extent the General Partner determines such action to be necessary or
appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of
the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain the
Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership or other entity in
which the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State
of Delaware or of any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do
business or own property. Subject to the terms of Section 3.4(a), the General
Partner shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a
copy of the Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification document or
any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.

 



 

Section 7.3 _ __Restrictions on General Partner Â’s Authority_.

 



 

Except as provided in Articles XII and XIV, the General Partner may not sell,
exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership Group, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions (including by way of merger, consolidation or other
combination) without the approval of holders of a Unit Majority; provided
however that this provision shall not preclude or limit the General PartnerÂ’s
ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all
or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership Group and shall not
apply to any forced sale of any or all of the assets of the Partnership Group
pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such
encumbrance. Without the approval of holders of a majority of Outstanding
Units, the General Partner shall not, on behalf of the Partnership except as
permitted under Sections 4.6, 11.1 and 11.2, elect or cause the Partnership to
elect a successor general partner of the Partnership. The General Partner
shall not cause or permit the Partnership or any member of the Partnership
Group to take any action set forth in Section 5.9(b)(xii) without the approval

Section 7.4 _Reimbursement of the General Partner_.

the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as general
partner or managing member of any Group Member.

 



 

(b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other
reasonable basis as the General Partner may determine, for (i) all direct and
indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership
(including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to any
Person) including Affiliates of the General Partner to perform services for
the Partnership or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to
the Partnership and, in the event the Partnership owns or operates, either
directly or through any Subsidiary, any pipelines subject to rate regulation
by FERC, including overhead allocated to the Partnership by Affiliates of the
General Partner for its allocable share of actual overhead expenses consistent
with then applicable accounting and allocation methodologies generally
permitted by FERC for rate making purposes (or in the absence of then
applicable methodologies permitted by FERC, consistent with the most recently
applicable methodologies) and past business practices, and (ii) all other
expenses allocable to the Partnership or otherwise incurred by the General
Partner in connection with operating the PartnershipÂ’s business (including
expenses allocated to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The General
Partner shall determine the expenses that are allocable to the Partnership.
Reimbursements pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be in addition to any
reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.7. The allocation of overhead to the Partnership by Affiliates of
the General Partner for its allocable share of actual overhead expenses
consistent with then applicable accounting and allocation methodologies
generally permitted by FERC for rate making purposes (or in the absence of
then applicable methodologies permitted by FERC, consistent with the most
recently applicable methodologies) and past business practices shall be deemed
to be fair and reasonable to the Partnership.

 



 

(c) The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who
shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans, employee programs and
employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
issuance of Partnership Securities or options to purchase or rights, warrants
or appreciation rights relating to **** Partnership Securities), or cause the
Partnership to issue Partnership Securities in connection with, or pursuant
to, any employee benefit plan, employee program or employee practice
maintained or sponsored by the General Partner or any one of its Affiliates,
in each case for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, any Group
Member or any Affiliate, or any of them, in respect of services performed,
directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership Group. The
Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates any Partnership Securities that the General Partner or such
Affiliate is obligated to provide to any employees pursuant to any such
employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices. Expenses
incurred by the General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs
and practices (including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliate
of Partnership Securities purchased by the General Partner or such Affiliate
from the Partnership to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs
and practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with Section 7.4(b). Any and
all obligations of the General Partner under any employee benefit plans,
employee programs or employee practices

 



      
 

 



 

adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this Section 7.4(c) shall
constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and shall be assumed
by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 or
the transferee of or successor to all of the General PartnerÂ’s General Partner
Interest pursuant to Section 4.6.

 



 

Section 7.5 _ __Outside Activities_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner, for so long as it is the general partner of the
Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as the general
partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any
other partnership or limited liability company of which the Partnership is,
directly or indirectly, a partner or managing member and to undertake
activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited
partner in the Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business or
activity or incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or
incidental to (A) its performance as general partner or managing member of one
or more Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statement, (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt or equity securities
in any Group Member; provided, however, that neither clause (i) or clause (ii)
shall prohibit the General Partner from owning, directly or indirectly,
limited partner interests or limited liability company interests in another
Person.

 



 

(b) Except as specifically restricted by Section 7.5(a), each Group Member and
Indemnitee shall have the right to engage in businesses of every type and
description and other activities for profit and to engage in and possess an
interest in other business ventures of any and every type or description,
whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in by any Group
Member, independently or with others, including business interests and
activities in direct competition with the business and activities of any Group
Member, and none of the same shall constitute a breach of this Agreement or
any duty expressed or implied by law to any Group Member or any Partner.
Neither any Group Member, any Limited Partner nor any other Person shall have
any rights by virtue of this Agreement, the MLP Agreement or the partnership
relationship established hereby or thereby in any business ventures of any
Group Member or any Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms of Sections 7.5(a) and 7.5(b), but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging
in competitive activities by any Group Member or any Indemnitee in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 7.5 is hereby approved by the Partnership
and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to be a breach of any fiduciary
duties or any other obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner
for any Group Member or any Indemnitee to engage in such business interests
and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the Partnership and
(iii) none of the General Partner, any Group Member nor any Indemnitee shall
have any obligation hereunder or as a result of any duty expressed or implied
by law to present business opportunities to the Partnership, any other Group
Member or any Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) The General Partner and any of its Affiliates may acquire Units or other
Partnership Securities and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a General Partner or Limited
Partner, as applicable, relating to such Units or Partnership Securities.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The term " _Affiliates_ " when used in Section 7.5(d) with respect to the
General Partner shall not include any Group Member or any Subsidiary of the
Group Member.

 



 

(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent
that any provision of this Agreement purports or is interpreted to have the
effect of limiting or restricting the fiduciary duties that might otherwise,
as a result of Delaware or other applicable law, be owed by the General
Partner, its Board of Directors or any committee thereof to the Partnership
and its Limited Partners, each Limited Partner consents to such limitations
and restrictions related to such fiduciary duties to the maximum extent that
such consent is permitted under Delaware or other applicable law.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership; Contracts with Affiliates; Certain Restrictions on the General
Partner_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may, but shall be under no
obligation to, lend to any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the
Group Member for such periods of time and in such amounts as the General
Partner may determine. Any loan made to a Group Member by the General Partner
or any of its Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and reasonable to the
Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements of this Section
7.6(a) shall be deemed satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by Special
Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to
the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from
unrelated third parties or (iii) any transaction that, taking into account the
totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other
transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the
Partnership), is equitable to the Partnership. The borrowing party shall
reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than any additional interest
costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the borrowing of such
funds. For purposes of Sections 7.6(a) and 7.6(b), the term " _Group Member_ "
shall include any Affiliate of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group
Member. No Group Member may lend funds to the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates (other than another Group Member).

 



 

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
determined by the General Partner provided, however, that the Partnership may
not charge the Group Member interest at a rate less than the rate that would
be charged to the Group Member (without reference to the General PartnerÂ’s
financial abilities or guarantees) by unrelated lenders on comparable loans.
The foregoing authority shall be exercised by the General Partner in its sole
discretion and shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Group
Member or any other Person.

 



 

(c) No borrowing by any Group Member or the approval thereof by the General
Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty, expressed or
implied, of the General Partner or its Affiliates to the Partnership or the
Limited Partners by reason of the fact that the purpose or effect of such
borrowing is directly or indirectly to (i) enable distributions to the General
Partner or its Affiliates (including in their capacities as Limited Partners)
to exceed the General PartnerÂ’s Percentage Interest of the total amount
distributed to all partners.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an agreement with any of
its Affiliates to, render services to a Group Member or to the General Partner
in the discharge of its duties as general partner of the Partnership. Any
services rendered to a Group Member by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements of this Section 7.6(d) shall be
deemed satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii)
any transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership
than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third
parties or (iii) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is
equitable to the Partnership. The provisions of Section 7.4 shall apply to the
rendering of services described in this Section 7.6(d).

 



 

(e) The Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, other partnerships,
corporations, limited liability companies or other business entities in which
it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such
conditions as are consistent with this Agreement and applicable law.

 



 

(f) Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer
or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are fair and
reasonable to the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements
of this Section 7.7(f) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to (i) any
transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii) any transaction, the terms of
which are no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally being
provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or (iii) any
transaction that, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be
particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable to
the Partnership. With respect to any contribution of assets to the Partnership
in exchange for Partnership Securities, the Conflicts Committee, in
determining whether the appropriate number of Partnership Securities are being
issued, may take into account, among other things, the fair market value of
the assets, the liquidated and contingent liabilities assumed, the tax basis
in the assets, the extent to which tax-only allocations to the transferor will
protect the existing partners of the Partnership against a low tax basis, and
such other factors as the Conflicts Committee deems relevant under the
circumstances.

 



 

(g) The General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation to permit
any Group Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and
its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time
to time specifically dealing with such use, nor shall there be any obligation
on the part of the General Partner or its Affiliates to enter into such
contracts.

 



 

(h) Without limitation of Sections 7.6(a) through 7.6(g), and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the existence of the conflicts of
interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby approved by all
Partners.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.7 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) To the maximum extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any
Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; _provided_ , that the
Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Indemnitee acted in bad
faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct, or in the case of a criminal
matter, acted with knowledge that the IndemniteeÂ’s conduct was unlawful. Any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not
be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to
contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to
effectuate such indemnification.

 



 

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section
7.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from
time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a determination that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership
of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if
it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
as authorized in this Section 7.7.

 



 

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests
entitled to vote on such matter, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to
actions in the IndemniteeÂ’s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any
other capacity, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve
in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors,
assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that
may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the PartnershipÂ’s
activities or such PersonÂ’s activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute " _fines"_ within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken
or omitted by it with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

any employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose
reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is in the
best interests of the Partnership.

 



 

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to
create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

 



 

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision
hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past,
present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the
obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Liability of Indemnitees_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, the Assignees or any other Persons who have acquired
interests in the Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has
been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the
Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in
the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the IndemniteeÂ’s
conduct was criminal.

 



 

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 7.1(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to
it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder
either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not
be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

 



 

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the PartnershipÂ’s business or affairs shall not be
liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted, and provided such Person became an
Indemnitee hereunder prior to such amendment, modification or repeal.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and
Modification of Duties_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whenever a
potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member,
any Partner or any Assignee, on the other, any resolution or course of action
by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such conflict of
interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or of any agreement contemplated herein
or therein, or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the
resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i)
approved by Special Approval, (ii) approved by the vote of a majority of the
Common Units (excluding Common Units owned by the General Partner and its
Affiliates), (iii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those
generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iv)
fair and reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of
the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions
that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The
General Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its
resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval of such
resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of
action that has not received Special Approval. If Special Approval is not
sought and the Board of Directors of the General Partner determines that the
resolution or course of action taken with respect to a conflict of interest
satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above,
then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of Directors
acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by any Limited Partner or
Assignee or by or on behalf of such Limited Partner or Assignee or any other
Limited Partner or Assignee or the Partnership challenging such approval, the
Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of
overcoming such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of
the conflicts of interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby
approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to
take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its
capacity as the general partner of the Partnership as opposed to in its
individual capacity, whether under this Agreement, or any other agreement
contemplated hereby or otherwise, then unless another express standard is
provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, or such Affiliates
causing it to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take
such other action in good faith and shall not be subject to any other or
different standards imposed by this Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation or at equity. In order for a determination or other action to be in
" _good faith_ " for purposes of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

the Person or Persons (including the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof acting on behalf of the General Partner) making such determination or
taking or declining to take such other action must believe that the
determination or other action is in the best interests of the Partnership.

 



 

(c) Whenever the General Partner (including the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof acting on behalf of the General Partner) makes a
determination or takes or declines to take any other action, or any of its
Affiliates causes it to do so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its
capacity as a general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General
Partner (including the Board of Directors or any committee thereof acting on
behalf of the General Partner), or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are
entitled to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other
action free of any fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership,
any Limited Partner or Assignee, and the General Partner (including the Board
of Directors or any committee thereof acting on behalf of the General
Partner), or such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not be required to act
in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any
other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other
law, rule or regulation or at equity. By way of illustration and not of
limitation, whenever the phrase, " _at the option of the General Partner_ ,"
or some variation of that phrase, is used in this Agreement, it indicates that
the General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of
doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Units, or refrains
from voting or transferring its Units, it shall be acting in its individual
capacity. The General PartnerÂ’s organizational documents may provide that
determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather
than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if
the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the
General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the
General PartnerÂ’s general partner, if the General Partner is a limited
partnership.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
General Partner and its Affiliates, nor the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof, shall have any duty or obligation, express or implied, to
(i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership Group other than
in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group Member to use any
facilities or assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may
be provided in contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing
with such use. Any determination by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be at its option.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, none of the General
Partner, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors nor
any other Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary
duties, to the Partnership or any Limited Partner or Assignee. The provisions
of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict, eliminate or otherwise
modify the duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of the General
Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are
agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of the
General Partner, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of
Directors or such other Indemnitee.

 



 

(f) The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the
Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve of actions by
the general

 



      
 

 



 

partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to those actions
permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 7.9.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner (including the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof acting on behalf of the General Partner) may rely and shall be
protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 



 

(b) The General Partner (including the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof acting on behalf of the General Partner) may consult with legal
counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers
and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken in reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of
Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner (including the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof acting on behalf of the General
Partner) reasonably believes to be within such PersonÂ’s professional or expert
competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good
faith and in accordance with such opinion.

 



 

(c) The General Partner (including the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof acting on behalf of the General Partner) shall have the right, in
respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of
its duly authorized officers, a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact
or the duly authorized officers of the Partnership. Each such attorney shall,
to the extent provided by the General Partner (including the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof acting on behalf of the General Partner) in
the power of attorney, have full power and authority to do and perform each
and every act and duty that is permitted or required to be done by the General
Partner (including the Board of Directors or any committee thereof acting on
behalf of the General Partner) hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities_.

 



 

The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire
Partnership Securities, which shall be held by the Partnership as treasury
securities unless they are expressly canceled by action of an appropriate
officer of the General Partner. As long as Partnership Securities are held by
any Group Member, such Partnership Securities shall not be considered
Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein. The General
Partner or any of its Affiliates may also purchase or otherwise acquire and
sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership Securities for their own account,
subject to the provisions of Articles IV and X.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates_.

 



 

(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
(including for purposes of this Section 7.12, any Person that is an Affiliate
of the General Partner at the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later
cease to be an Affiliate of the General Partner) holds Partnership Securities
that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any
successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from
registration is not available

 



      
 

 



 

to enable such holder of Partnership Securities (the " _Holder_ ") to dispose
of the number of Partnership Securities it desires to sell at the time it
desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act, then at the
option and upon the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall file with the
Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain
effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective
date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all Partnership Securities
covered by such registration statement have been sold, a registration
statement under the Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the
number of Partnership Securities specified by the Holder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership shall not be required to effect more than
three registrations pursuant to this Section 7.12(a) and Section 7.12(b); and
provided further, however, that if the Conflicts Committee determines in good
faith that the requested registration would be materially detrimental to the
Partnership and its Partners because such registration would (x) materially
interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar
transaction involving the Partnership, (y) require premature disclosure of
material information that the Partnership has a bona fide business purpose for
preserving as confidential or (z) render the Partnership unable to comply with
requirements under applicable securities laws, then the Partnership shall have
the right to postpone such requested registration for a period of not more
than six months after receipt of the HolderÂ’s request, such right pursuant to
this Section 7.12(a) or Section 7.12(b) not to be utilized more than once in
any twelve-month period. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
Partnership shall be deemed not to have used all reasonable efforts to keep
the registration statement effective during the applicable period if it
voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Partnership
Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Partnership
Securities at any time during such period, unless such action is required by
applicable law. In connection with any registration pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Partnership shall (i) promptly prepare and
file (A) such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the
securities subject to such registration under the securities laws of such
states as the Holder shall reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
thereof, the Partnership would become subject to general service of process or
to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or
partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such
registration, and (B) such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing
or to list the Partnership Securities subject to such registration on such
National Securities Exchange as the Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii)
do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or appropriate to
enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of such Partnership Securities
in such states. Except as set forth in Section 7.12(d), all costs and expenses
of any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts
and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by
the Holder.

 



 

(b) If any Holder holds Partnership Securities that it desires to sell and
Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule
144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such
Holder to dispose of the number of Partnership Securities it desires to sell
at the time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act,
then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall
file with the Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such
request, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become
effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months
following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when
all

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership Securities covered by such shelf registration statement have been
sold, a " _shelf_ " registration statement covering the Partnership Securities
specified by the Holder on an appropriate form under Rule 415 under the
Securities Act, or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall not be required to effect
more than three registrations pursuant to Section 7.12(a) and this Section
7.12(b); and provided further, however, that if the Audit and Conflicts
Committee determines in good faith that any offering under, or the use of any
prospectus forming a part of, the shelf registration statement would be
materially detrimental to the Partnership and its Partners because such
offering or use would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition,
reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Partnership, (y)
require premature disclosure of material information that the Partnership has
a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render the
Partnership unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities
laws, then the Partnership shall have the right to suspend such offering or
use for a period of not more than six months after receipt of the HolderÂ’s
request, such right pursuant to Section 7.12(a) or this Section 7.12(b) not to
be utilized more than once in any twelve-month period. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence, the Partnership shall be deemed not to have used all
commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement
effective during the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that
would result in Holders of Partnership Securities covered thereby not being
able to offer and sell such Partnership Securities at any time during such
period, unless such action is required by applicable law. In connection with
any shelf registration pursuant to this Section 7.12(b), the Partnership shall
(i) promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to
register or qualify the securities subject to such shelf registration under
the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such qualification shall be required in any
jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject
to general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business
as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction
solely as a result of such shelf registration, and (B) such documents as may
be necessary to apply for listing or to list the Partnership Securities
subject to such shelf registration on such National Securities Exchange as the
Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii) do any and all other acts and things
that may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a
public sale of such Partnership Securities in such states. Except as set forth
in Section 7.12(d), all costs and expenses of any such shelf registration and
offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid
by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

 



 

(c) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of the
Partnership for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee
benefit plan), the Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to include such number or amount of securities held by any Holder in such
registration statement as the Holder shall request; provided, that the
Partnership is not required to make any effort or take an action to so include
the securities of the Holder once the registration statement becomes or is
declared effective by the Commission, including any registration statement
providing for the offering from time to time of securities pursuant to Rule
415 of the Securities Act. If the proposed offering pursuant to this Section
7.12(c) shall be an underwritten offering, then, in the event that the
managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering advise the
Partnership and the Holder in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of
all or some of the HolderÂ’s Partnership Securities would adversely and
materially

 



      
 

 



 

affect the success of the offering, the Partnership shall include in such
offering only that number or amount, if any, of securities held by the Holder
that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters,
will not so adversely and materially affect the offering. Except as set forth
in Section 7.12(d), all costs and expenses of any such registration and
offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid
by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

 



 

(d) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this Section 7.12, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
in addition to and not in limitation of the PartnershipÂ’s obligation under
Section 7.7, the Partnership shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each
Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and
any agent thereof (collectively, " _Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act
or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this Section 7.12(d) as a " _claim_ "
and in the plural as " _claims_ ") based upon, arising out of or resulting
from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any registration statement under which any Partnership Securities
were registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or Blue Sky
laws, in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of
such registration statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Partnership is
required to keep the registration statement current), or arising out of, based
upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person to the extent that
any such claim arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such registration statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or
such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

 



 

(e) The provisions of Sections 7.12(a), 7.12(b) and 7.12(c) shall continue to
be applicable with respect to the General Partner (and any of the General
PartnerÂ’s Affiliates) after it ceases to be a general partner of the
Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of
such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the Holder to
sell all of the Partnership Securities with respect to which it has requested
during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise
filed or that a registration statement be filed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Partnership shall not be required to file successive registration
statements covering the same Partnership Securities for which registration was
demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of Section 7.12(d) shall
continue in effect thereafter.

 



 

(f) The rights to cause the Partnership to register Partnership Securities
pursuant to this Section 7.12 may be assigned (but only with all related
obligations) by a Holder

 



      
 

 



 

to a transferee or assignee of such Partnership Securities, provided (i) the
Partnership is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with
written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the
Partnership Securities with respect to which such registration rights are
being assigned; and (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be
bound by and subject to the terms set forth in this Section 7.12.

 



 

(g) Any request to register Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section
7.12 shall (i) specify the Partnership Securities intended to be offered and
sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such PersonÂ’s present
intent to offer such Partnership Securities for distribution, (iii) describe
the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale of Partnership Securities,
and (iv) contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such
information and materials and take all action as may be required in order to
permit the Partnership to comply with all applicable requirements in
connection with the registration of such Partnership Securities.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Reliance by Third Parties_.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner and
any officer of the General Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on
behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has full power and authority to
encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the
Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the
Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner or any such officer as if it were the PartnershipÂ’s sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives
any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such
Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or
any such officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any
Person dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of the Agreement have
been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act
or action of the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives.
Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of
the Partnership by the General Partner or any such officer or its
representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution
and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was
in full force and effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such
certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so
for and on behalf of the Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or
instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

accordance with this Section 10.1(a) or the issuance of any Limited Partner
Interests in a merger or consolidation pursuant to Article XIV, and except as
provided in Section 10.1(b), each transferee of a Limited Partner Interest
(including any nominee holder or an agent or representative acquiring such
Limited Partner Interests for the account of another Person) (i) shall be
admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited
Partner Interests so transferred to such Person when any such transfer or
admission is reflected in the books and records of the Partnership, with or
without execution of this Agreement, (ii) shall become bound by the terms of,
and shall be deemed to have executed, this Agreement, (iii) shall become the
Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interests so transferred, (iv) represents

Agreement, (v) grants the powers of attorney set forth in this Agreement and
(vi) makes the consents and waivers contained in this Agreement. The transfer
of any Limited Partner Interests and the admission of any new Limited Partner
shall not constitute and amendment to this Agreement. Except as provided in
Section 10.1(b), a Person may become a Record Holder of a Limited Partner
Interest without the consent or approval of any of the Partners. A Person may
not become a Limited Partner without acquiring a Limited Partner Interest and
until such Person is reflected in the books and records of the Partnership as
the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interest. The rights and obligations
of a Person who is an Ineligible Assignee shall be determined in accordance
with Section 10.1(b).

 



 

(b) Following a FERC Notice, (i) clause (i) of Section 10.1(a) shall no longer
be applicable, (ii) the transferor of a Limited Partner Interest made in

right to seek admission as a Substituted Limited Partner subject to the
conditions of, and in the manner permitted under, this Agreement and (iii) a
transferor of a Certificate representing a Limited Partner Interest shall only
have the authority to convey to a purchaser or other transferee who does not

the right to request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner to such
purchaser or other transferee in respect of the transferred Limited Partner
Interests. No transferor of a Limited Partnership Interest or other Person
shall have any obligation or responsibility to provide a Transfer Application
to a transferee or assist or participate in any way with respect to the
completion or delivery thereof. Following a FERC Notice, each transferee of a
Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee holder or an agent acquiring
such Limited Partner Interest for the account of another Person) who executes
and delivers a properly completed Transfer Application, containing a properly
completed and executed Taxation Certification, shall, by virtue of such
execution and delivery, be an Assignee. Such Assignee shall automatically be
admitted to the Partnership as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to
the Limited Partner Interests so transferred to such Person at such time as
such transfer is recorded in the books and records of the Partnership, and
until so recorded, such transferee shall be an Assignee. The General Partner
shall periodically, but no less frequently than on the first Business Day of
each calendar quarter, cause any unrecorded transfers of Limited Partner

 



      
 

 



 

Interests with respect to which a properly completed, duly executed Transfer
Application, including the accompanying Taxation Certification, has been
received to be recorded in the books and records of the Partnership. An
Assignee shall have an interest in the Partnership equivalent to that of a
Limited Partner with respect to allocations and distributions, including
liquidating distributions, of the Partnership. With respect to voting rights
attributable to Limited Partner Interests that are held by Assignees, the
General Partner shall be deemed to be the Limited Partner with respect thereto
and shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Limited Partner
Interests on any matter, vote such Limited Partner Interests at the written
direction of the Assignee who is the Record Holder of such Limited Partner
Interests. If no such written direction is received, such Limited Partner
Interests will not be voted. An Assignee shall have no other rights of a
Limited Partner.

 



 

Section 10.2 _ __Admission of Successor General Partner_.

immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor or
transferring General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 or the transfer
of such General PartnerÂ’s General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 4.6;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such successor shall be admitted to the
Partnership until compliance with the terms of Section 4.6 has occurred and
such successor has executed and delivered such other documents or instruments
as may be required to effect such admission. Any such successor shall, subject
to the terms hereof, carry on the business of the Partnership without
dissolution.

 



 

Section 10.3 _ __Admission of Additional Limited Partners_.

 



 

(a) A Person (other than the General Partner or a Substituted Limited Partner)
who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this
Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited

General Partner. The admission of any Person as an Additional Limited Partner

recorded as such in the books and records of the Partnership, following the
consent of the General Partner to such admission.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.4 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership_.

by law, the General Partner shall prepare and file an amendment to the
Certificate of Limited Partnership, and the General Partner may for this
purpose, among others, exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to

properties;

 



 

(v) a final and non-appealable order of relief under Chapter 7 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code is entered by a court with appropriate jurisdiction
pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary petition by or against the General
Partner; or

 



 

(vi) (A) in the event the General Partner is a corporation, a certificate of

charter without a reinstatement of its charter, under the laws of its state of
incorporation; (B) in the event the General Partner is a partnership or a
limited liability company, the dissolution and commencement of winding up of

termination of the General Partner.

 



      
 

 



 

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi)(A),
(B), (C) or (E) occurs, the withdrawing General Partner shall give notice to
the Limited Partners within 30 days after such occurrence. The Partners hereby
agree that only the Events of Withdrawal described in this Section 11.1 shall
result in the withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership.

 



 

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence
of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
under the following circumstances: (i) at any time prior to 12:00 midnight,
Central Standard Time, on December 31, 2015, the General Partner voluntarily
withdraws by giving at least 90 daysÂ’ advance notice of its intention to
withdraw to the Limited Partners; provided that prior to the effective date of
such withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a
majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the
General Partner and its Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the
Partnership an Opinion of Counsel (" _Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel_ ") that
such withdrawal (following the selection of the successor General Partner)
would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner
or any Group Member or cause any Group Member to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes (to the extent not previously treated or taxed as such);
(ii) at any time after 12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, on December 31,

time that the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90
daysÂ’ advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners,
such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the
time such notice is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control
at least 50% of the Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner
from the Partnership upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also
constitute the withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner or
managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members. If the
General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i),
the holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The Person so elected as
successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general
partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member. If, prior to the effective date of the General PartnerÂ’s withdrawal
pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), a successor is not selected by the Unitholders
as provided herein or the Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of
Counsel, the Partnership shall be dissolved in accordance with Section 12.1.
Any successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this
Section 11.1 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.2 _Removal of the General Partner_.

 



 

The General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the
Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units
held by the General Partner and its Affiliates). Any such action by such
holders for removal of the General Partner must also provide for the election
of a successor General Partner by the Unitholders holding a majority of
Outstanding Units (including Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates). Such removal shall be effective immediately following the
admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to Section 10.2. The removal
of the General Partner shall also automatically constitute the removal of the
General Partner as general partner or managing member, to the extent
applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner is a
general partner or a managing member. If a Person is elected as a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2, such Person
shall, upon admission pursuant to Section 10.2, automatically become a
successor general partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the
other Group Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a
managing member. The right of the holders of Outstanding Units to remove the
General Partner shall not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has
received an opinion opining as to the matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion
of Counsel. Any successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms
of this Section 11.2 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

 



 

Section 11.3 _Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General
Partner_.

 



 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the
General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where
Cause does not exist, if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance
with the terms of Section 11.1 or 11.2, the Departing General Partner shall
have the option exercisable prior to the effective date of the departure of
such Departing General Partner to require its successor to purchase (x) its
General Partner Interest and (y) its general partner interest (or equivalent
interest), if any, in the other Group Members ((x) and (y) collectively, the "
_Combined Interest_ ") in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair
market value of such Combined Interest, such amount to be determined and
payable as of the effective date of its departure or, if there is not
agreement as to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, within 10
days after such agreement is reached. If the General Partner is removed by the
Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner
withdraws under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement,
and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the successor General Partner is not
the former General Partner), such successor shall have the option, exercisable
prior to the effective date of the departure of such Departing General Partner
(or, in the event the business of the Partnership is continued, prior to the
date the business of the Partnership is continued), to purchase the Combined
Interest of the Departing General Partner for such fair market value of such
Combined Interest of the Departing General Partner. In either event, the
Departing General Partner shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due
such Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 7.4, including any
employee-related liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in
connection with the termination of any employees

 



      
 

 



 

employed by the Departing General Partner for the benefit of the Partnership
or the other Group Members.

 



 

For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of a Departing
General PartnerÂ’s Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between
the Departing General Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within
30 days after the effective date of such Departing General PartnerÂ’s
departure, by an independent investment banking firm or other independent
expert selected by the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in
turn, may rely on other experts, and the determination of which shall be
conclusive as to such matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one
independent investment banking firm or other independent expert within 45 days
after the effective date of such departure, then the Departing General Partner
shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent
expert, the Departing General PartnerÂ’s successor shall designate an
independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such
firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment banking
firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm or
other independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined
Interest of the Departing General Partner. In making its determination, such
third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert may
consider the then current trading price of Units on any National Securities
Exchange on which Units are then listed or admitted for trading, the value of
the PartnershipÂ’s assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing General
Partner and other factors it may deem relevant.

 



 

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
Section 11.3(a), the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) shall
become a Limited Partner and its Combined Interest shall be converted into
Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or
other independent expert selected pursuant to Section 11.3(a), without
reduction in such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution
by reason of the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner
shall indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) as to all
debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which
the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner.
For purposes of this Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the
Departing General Partner to Common Units will be characterized as if such
General Partner (or its transferee) contributed its Combined Interest to the
Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Common Units.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners_.

 



 

No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;
_provided_ , _however_ , that when a transferee of a Limited PartnerÂ’s Limited
Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so
transferred, such transferring Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited
Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION**

 



 

Section 12.1 _Dissolution_.

 



 

The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Additional Limited
Partners or by the admission of a successor General Partner in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Upon the removal or withdrawal of the General
Partner, if a successor General Partner is elected pursuant to Section 11.1 or
Section 11.2, the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such successor
General Partner shall continue the business of the Partnership. The
Partnership shall dissolve, and (subject to Section 12.2) its affairs shall be
wound up, upon:

 



 

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in Section
11.1(a) (other than Section 11.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is elected and an
Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in Section 11.1(b) or Section 11.2
and such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 10.2;

 



 

(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is
approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

 



 

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or

 



 

(d) at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the Partnership is
continued without dissolution in accordance with the Delaware Act.

 



 

Section 12.2 _Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution_.

 



 

Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of Withdrawal
caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as provided in
Section 11.1(a)(i) or (iii) and the failure of the Partners to select a
successor to such Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 11.1 or
Section 11.2, then within 90 days thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the
Partnership upon an event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in
Section 11.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi), then, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, within 180 days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to
continue the business of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement by appointing as a successor General Partner a Person
approved by the holders of a majority of Outstanding Units. Unless such an
election is made within the applicable time period as set forth above, the
Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If
such an election is so made, then:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier
dissolved in accordance with this Article XII;

 



 

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then
the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner
provided in Section 11.3; and

 



 

(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as
General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in
writing to be bound by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the right of the
holders of a majority of Outstanding Units to approve a successor General
Partner and to reconstitute and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited

 



      
 

 



 

liability of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the Partnership nor the MLP
would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise be
taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such
right to continue (to the extent not already so treated or taxed).

 



 

Section 12.3 _Liquidator_.

 



 

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership is continued
pursuant to Section 12.2, the General Partner shall select one or more Persons
to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall
be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as may be approved
by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units voting as a
single class. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree
not to resign at any time without 15 daysÂ’ prior notice and may be removed at
any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of
at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units voting as a single class.
Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and
substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and
duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved
by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units voting as a
single class. The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the
manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or
substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as
expressly provided in this Article XII, the Liquidator approved in the manner
provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further authorization or
consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the
General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but subject to all of the
applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon the exercise of such
powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in Section 7.3) necessary
or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator
hereunder for and during the period of time required to complete the winding
up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Liquidation_.

 



 

The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership,
discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner
and over such period as the Liquidator determines to be in the best interest
of the Partners, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the
following:

 



 

(a) _Disposition of Assets_. The assets may be disposed of by public or
private sale or by distribution in kind to one or more Partners on such terms
as the Liquidator and such Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is
distributed in kind, the Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for
purposes of Section 12.4(c) to have received cash equal to its fair market
value; and contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be
made to the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or
distribution of the PartnershipÂ’s assets for a reasonable time if it
determines that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the
PartnershipÂ’s assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners. The Liquidator may distribute the PartnershipÂ’s assets, in whole or
in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would
cause undue loss to the Partners.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Discharge of Liabilities_. Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts
owed to the Liquidator as compensation for serving in such capacity (subject
to the terms of Section 12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in
respect of their distribution rights under Article VI. With respect to any
liability that is contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet
due and payable, the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount
as it thinks appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to
provide for its payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be
distributed as additional liquidation proceeds.

 



 

(c) _Liquidation Distributions_. Subject to Section 12.10, all property and
all cash in excess of that required to discharge liabilities as provided in
Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with, and
to the extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts,
as determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments (other
than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this Section 12.4(c))
for the taxable year of the Partnership during which the liquidation of the
Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being determined pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall
be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after
said date of such occurrence).

 



 

Section 12.5 _ __Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_.

 



 

Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as
provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of
the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than
the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

 



 

Section 12.6 _ __Return of Contributions_.

 



 

The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to
enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the
Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

 



 

Section 12.7 _ __Waiver of Partition_.

 



 

To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right
to partition of the Partnership property.

 



 

Section 12.8 _ __Capital Account Restoration_.

 



 

No Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance in its
Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership.

 



 

Section 12.9 _ __Certain Prohibited Acts_.

 



 

Without obtaining Special Approval, the General Partner shall not take any
action to cause the Partnership or the MLP to (i) make or consent to a general
assignment for the benefit

 



      
 

 



 

of the PartnershipÂ’s or the MLPÂ’s creditors; (ii) file or consent to the
filing of any bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization petition for relief
under the United States Bankruptcy Code naming the Partnership or the MLP or
otherwise seek, with respect to the Partnership or the MLP, relief from debts
or protection from creditors generally; (iii) file or consent to the filing of
a petition or answer seeking for the Partnership or the MLP a liquidation,
dissolution, arrangement, or similar relief under any law; (iv) file an answer
or other pleading admitting or failing to contest the material allegations of
a petition filed against the Partnership or the MLP in a proceeding of the
type described in clauses (i) Â— (iii) of this Section 12.9; (v) seek, consent
to or acquiesce in the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, conservator,
assignee, trustee, sequestrator, custodian or any similar official for the
Partnership or the MLP or for all or any substantial portion of its
properties; (vi) sell all or substantially all of its assets, except in
accordance with Section 7.3(b); (vii) dissolve or liquidate, except in
accordance with Article XII; or (viii) merge or consolidate, except in
accordance with Article XIV.

 



 

Section 12.10 _Series A Liquidation Value and Series B Liquidation Value._

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the
event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, either
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the Series A Preferred Units and
Series B Units, on a _pari passu_ basis, shall be entitled to receive, out of
the assets of the Partnership available for distribution to Partners, prior
and in preference to any distribution of any assets of the Partnership to the
holders of any other class or series of Partnership Securities, the positive
value in each such holderÂ’s Capital Account in respect of such Series A
Preferred Units and Series B Units. If, in the year of such liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up, any such holderÂ’s Adjusted Capital Account in
respect of such Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units is less than the
aggregate Series A Liquidation Value of such holderÂ’s Series A Preferred Units
or the aggregate Series B Liquidation Value of such holderÂ’s Series B Units,
as the case may be, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, and prior to any other allocation pursuant to this
Agreement and to any distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, items of
gross income and gain for such year shall be allocated, among all holders as
to whose Adjusted Capital Account such is the case, proportionately to the
relative amounts by which each such holderÂ’s Adjusted Capital Account in
respect of such Series A Preferred Units or Series B Units is less than the
aggregate Series A Liquidation Value of such holderÂ’s Series A Preferred Units
or the aggregate Series B Liquidation Value of such holderÂ’s Series B Units,
as the case may be, until the Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each
Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit and each Outstanding Series B Unit is as
nearly as possible equal to the Series A Liquidation Value or the Series B
Liquidation Value, as the case may be (and no other allocation pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made to reverse the effect of such allocation). If in
the year of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up any such holderÂ’s
Adjusted Capital Account in respect of such Series A Preferred Units or Series
B Units is less than the aggregate Series A Liquidation Value of such Series A
Preferred Units or the aggregate Series B Liquidation Value of such Series B
Units, in each case after the application of the preceding sentence, then to
the extent permitted by law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, items of gross income and gain for any preceding
taxable period(s) with respect to which Schedule K-1s have not been filed by
the Partnership shall be reallocated, among all holders as to whose Adjusted
Capital Account such is the case, proportionately to the relative amounts by
which each such holderÂ’s Adjusted Capital Account in respect of such Series A
Preferred Units or Series B Units is less than the aggregate

 



      
 

 



 

Series A Liquidation Value of such holderÂ’s Series A Preferred Units or the
aggregate Series B Liquidation Value of such holderÂ’s Series B Units, as the
case may be, until the Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each Outstanding
Series A Preferred Unit and each Outstanding Series B Unit is as nearly as
possible equal to the Series A Liquidation Value or the Series B Liquidation
Value, as the case may be (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made to reverse the effect of such allocation).

respect, (ii) to be necessary or appropriate to (A) satisfy any requirements,
conditions or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or

Section 13.2 _ __Amendment Procedures_.

 



 

Except as provided in Sections 13.1 and 13.3, all amendments to this Agreement
shall be made in accordance with the following requirements. Amendments to
this Agreement may be proposed only by the General Partner; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to
propose any amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so free of any
fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership or any Limited
Partner and, in declining to propose an amendment to the maximum extent
permitted by law, shall not be required to act in good faith or pursuant to
any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at
equity. A proposed amendment shall be effective upon its approval by the
General Partner and the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a greater or
different percentage is required under this Agreement or by Delaware law. Each
proposed amendment that requires the approval of the holders of a specified
percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains
the text of the proposed amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the
General Partner shall seek the written approval of the requisite percentage of
Outstanding Units

 



      
 

 



 

or call a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed
amendment. The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final
adoption of any such proposed amendments. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no amendment of (i) the definitions of " _Conflicts
Committee_ ," " _Special Approval_ ", (ii) Section 2.9, (iii) Section 4.6,
(iv) Section 7.3(b), (v) Section 7.9(a), (vi) Section 12.9; (vii) Section
14.2, or (viii) any other provision of this Agreement requiring that Special
Approval be obtained as a condition to any action, shall be effective without
first obtaining Special Approval.

 



 

Section 13.3 _ __Amendment Requirements_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no provision of
this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units (including
Units deemed owned by the General Partner) required to take any action shall
be amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would
have the effect of reducing such voting percentage unless such amendment is
approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of holders of
Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than
the voting requirement sought to be reduced.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 13.1 and 13.2, no amendment to
this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited Partner without
its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of an
amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c) or (ii) enlarge the obligations
of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the
amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which consent may be
given or withheld at its option.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3, and without limitation of the General
PartnerÂ’s authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval
of any Partners as contemplated in Section 13.1, any amendment that would have
a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any class of
Partnership Interests in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests
must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Partnership Interests of the class affected.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by
Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of
the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single class
unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner under
applicable law.

 



 

(e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be
amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding
Units.

 



 

Section 13.4 _ __Special Meetings_.

 



 

All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be
taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. Special meetings of the
Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners
owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Partnership

 



      
 

 



 

Securities of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited
Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the General Partner one
or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to
call a special meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for
which the special meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of
such a call from Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be
reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules,
regulations, listing agreements or similar requirements governing the holding
of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the
General Partner shall send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners
either directly or indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be
held at a time and place determined by the General Partner on a date not less
than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the mailing of notice of the meeting.
Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the Limited
Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the
business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited
PartnersÂ’ limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other
state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

 



 

Section 13.5 _ __Notice of a Meeting_.

 



 

Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall be given to the
Record Holders of the class or classes of Limited Partner Interests for which
a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of written
communication in accordance with Section 16.1. The notice shall be deemed to
have been given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means
of written communication.

 



 

Section 13.6 _ __Record Date_.

 



 

For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a
meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the General Partner may set a Record
Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a) the
date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Limited Partner Interests are listed or admitted for trading, in
which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such National
Securities Exchange shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are
sought without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners are requested in
writing by the General Partner to give such approvals.

 



 

Section 13.7 _ __Adjournment_.

 



 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 13.8 _ __Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes_.

 



 

The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and
noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a
meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present,
either in person or by proxy. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited
Partner attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a
meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of
matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting, but not so
included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the meeting

 



 

Section 13.9 _ __Quorum_.

 



 

The holders of a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Securities of the
class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Limited
Partner Interests deemed owned by the General Partner) represented in person
or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such
class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners requires
approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Limited Partner Interests,
in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of
the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at
which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding Outstanding
Partnership Securities that in the aggregate represent a majority of the
Outstanding Partnership Securities entitled to vote and be present in person
or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all
Limited Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required with
respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which case
the act of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Partnership Securities
that in the aggregate represent at least such greater or different percentage
shall be required. The Limited Partners present at a duly called or held
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by the required percentage of Outstanding Partnership Securities
specified in this Agreement (including Outstanding Partnership Securities
deemed owned by the General Partner). In the absence of a quorum any meeting
of Limited Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote
of holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Securities
entitled to vote at such meeting (including Outstanding Partnership Securities
deemed owned by the General Partner) represented either in person or by proxy,
but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.

 



 

Section 13.10 _ __Conduct of a Meeting_.

 



 

The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the manner
of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals
in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote, the
existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 13.4,
the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and the
determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection
with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall designate a
Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a
Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the
records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General
Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and
this Agreement as it

 



      
 

 



 

may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited
Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in
regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors
of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other
evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in writing.

 



 

Section 13.11 _ __Action Without a Meeting_.

 



 

If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an approval
in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by Limited Partners
owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests (including Limited Partner Interests deemed owned by the General
Partner) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting
at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such
provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any
National Securities Exchange on which the Limited Partner Interests are listed
or admitted for trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice
of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited
Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify
that any written ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of
taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership
within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the
General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of
the Limited Partner Interests held by the Limited Partners, the Partnership
shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Limited Partner
Interests that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the
Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the
General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and effect unless
and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of the General
Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of
a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are
deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to
the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right and the
action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not
cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management

The Partnership may merge or consolidate with one or more corporations,
limited liability companies, statutory trusts or associations, real estate
investment trusts, common law trusts or unincorporated businesses, including a
partnership (whether general or limited (including a limited liability

Section 14.2 _ __Procedure for Merger, Consolidation or Conversion_.

 



 

(a) Merger, consolidation or conversion of the Partnership pursuant to this
Article XIV requires the prior consent of the General Partner, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the General Partner
shall have no duty or obligation to consent to any merger, consolidation or
conversion of the Partnership and may decline to do so free of any fiduciary
duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner and, in
declining to consent to a merger, consolidation or conversion, shall not be
required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware
Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity.

 



 

(b) If the General Partner shall determine to consent to the merger or
consolidation, the General Partner shall approve the Merger Agreement, which
shall set forth:

 



 

(i) the names and jurisdictions of formation or organization of each of the
business entities proposing to merge or consolidate;

 



 

(ii) the name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of the business
entity that is to survive the proposed merger or consolidation (the "

(iii) the terms and conditions of the proposed merger or consolidation;

 



 

(iv) the manner and basis of exchanging or converting the equity securities of
each constituent business entity for, or into, cash, property or interests,
rights, securities or obligations of the Surviving Business Entity; and (i) if
any general or limited partner interests, securities or rights of any
constituent business entity are not to be exchanged or

 



      
 

 



 

converted solely for, or into, cash, property or general or limited partner
interests, rights, securities or obligations of the Surviving Business Entity,
the cash, property or interests, rights, securities or obligations of any
general or limited partnership, corporation, trust, limited liability company,
unincorporated business or other entity (other than the Surviving Business
Entity) which the holders of such general or limited partner interests,
securities or rights are to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of
their interests, securities or rights, and (ii) in the case of securities
represented by certificates, upon the surrender of such certificates, which
cash, property or general or limited partner interests, rights, securities or
obligations of the Surviving Business Entity or any general or limited
partnership, corporation, trust, limited liability company, unincorporated
business or other entity (other than the Surviving Business Entity), or
evidences thereof, are to be delivered;

 



 

(v) a statement of any changes in the constituent documents or the adoption of
new constituent documents (the articles or certificate of incorporation,
articles of trust, declaration of trust, certificate or agreement of limited
partnership, operating agreement or other similar charter or governing
document) of the Surviving Business Entity to be effected by such merger or
consolidation;

 



 

(vi) the effective time of the merger, which may be the date of the filing of
the certificate of merger pursuant to Section 14.4 or a later date specified
in or determinable in accordance with the Merger Agreement ( _provided_ , that
if the effective time of the merger is to be later than the date of the filing
of such certificate of merger, the effective time shall be fixed at a date or
time certain at or prior to the time of the filing of such certificate of
merger and stated therein); and

 



 

(vii) such other provisions with respect to the proposed merger or
consolidation that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate.

 



 

(c) If the General Partner shall determine to consent to the conversion, the
General Partner may approve and adopt a Plan of Conversion containing such
terms and conditions that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate.

 



 

Section 14.3 _ __Approval by Limited Partners_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), the General Partner, upon its
approval of the Merger Agreement or Plan of Conversion, as the case may be,
shall direct that the Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as
applicable, be submitted to a vote of Limited Partners, whether at a special
meeting or by written consent, in either case in accordance with the
requirements of Article XIII. A copy or a summary of the Merger Agreement or
the Plan of Conversion, as applicable, shall be included in or enclosed with
the notice of a special meeting or the written consent.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), the Merger Agreement or the Plan of
Conversion, as applicable, shall be approved upon receiving the affirmative
vote or consent of the holders of a Unit Majority.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3(d), after such approval by vote or
consent of the Limited Partners, and at any time prior to the filing of the
certificate of merger or

 



   

     
 

 



 

a certificate of conversion pursuant to Section 14.4, the merger,
consolidation or conversion may be abandoned pursuant to provisions therefor,
if any, set forth in the Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the
case may be.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article XIV or in this
Agreement, the General Partner is permitted without Limited Partner approval,
to convert the Partnership or any Group Member into a new limited liability
entity, to merge the Partnership or any Group Member into, or convey all of
the PartnershipÂ’s assets to, another limited liability entity which shall be
newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or operations at the time
of such conversion, merger or conveyance other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an
Opinion of Counsel that the merger or conveyance, as the case may be, would
not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner or
cause the Partnership or the MLP to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax
purposes (to the extent not previously treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose
of such conversion, merger or conveyance is to effect a mere change in the
legal form of the Partnership into another limited liability entity and (iii)
the governing instruments of the new entity provide the Limited Partners and
the General Partner with the same rights and obligations as are herein
contained.

 



 

(e) Additionally, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article XIV
or in this Agreement, the General Partner is permitted, without Limited
Partner approval, to merge or consolidate the Partnership with or into another
entity if (A) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the
merger or consolidation, as the case may be, would not result in the loss of
the limited liability of any Limited Partner or cause the Partnership to be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously
treated as such), (B) the merger or consolidation would not result in an
amendment to the Partnership Agreement, other than any amendments that could
be adopted pursuant to Section 13.1, (C) the Partnership is the Surviving
Business Entity in such merger or consolidation, (D) each Partnership Unit
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger or
consolidation is to be an identical Partnership Unit of the Partnership after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation, and (E) the number of
Partnership Securities to be issued by the Partnership in such merger or
consolidation do not exceed 20% of the Partnership Securities Outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of such merger or consolidation.

 



 

Section 14.4 _ __Certificate of Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the required approval, if any, by the General Partner and the
Unitholders of a Merger Agreement or a Plan of Conversion, as the case may be,
a certificate of merger or certificate of conversion, as applicable, shall be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
conformity with the requirements of the Delaware Act.

 



 

(b) At the effective time of the certificate of merger:

 



 

(i) all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the business entities
that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and
causes of action belonging to each

 



      
 

 



 

of those business entities, shall be vested in the Surviving Business Entity
and after the merger or consolidation shall be the property of the Surviving
Business Entity to the extent they were of each constituent business entity;

 



 

(ii) the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in any of
those constituent business entities shall not revert and is not in any way
impaired because of the merger or consolidation;

 



 

(iii) all rights of creditors and all liens on or security interests in
property of any of those constituent business entities shall be preserved
unimpaired; and

 



 

(iv) all debts, liabilities and duties of those constituent business entities
shall attach to the Surviving Business Entity and may be enforced against it
to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred
or contracted by it.

 



 

(c) At the effective time of the certificate of conversion:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall continue to exist, without interruption, but in the
organizational form of the converted entity rather than in its prior
organizational form;

 



 

(ii) all rights, title, and interests to all real estate and other property
owned by the Partnership shall continue to be owned by the converted entity in
its new organizational form without reversion or impairment, without further
act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but
subject to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon;

 



 

(iii) all liabilities and obligations of the Partnership shall continue to be
liabilities and obligations of the converted entity in its new organizational
form without impairment or diminution by reason of the conversion;

 



 

(iv) all rights of creditors or other parties with respect to or against the
prior interest holders or other owners of the Partnership in their capacities
as such in existence as of the effective time of the conversion will continue
in existence as to those liabilities and obligations and may be pursued by
such creditors and obligees as if the conversion did not occur;

 



 

(v) a proceeding pending by or against the Partnership or by or against any of
Partners in their capacities as such may be continued by or against the
converted entity in its new organizational form and by or against the prior
partners without any need for substitution of parties; and

 



 

(vi) the Partnership Securities that are to be converted into partnership
interests, shares, evidences of ownership, or other securities in the
converted entity as provided in the Plan of Conversion or certificate of
conversion shall be so converted, and Partners shall be entitled only to the
rights provided in the Plan of Conversion or certificate of conversion.

 



 

(d) A merger, consolidation or conversion effected pursuant to this Article
shall not be deemed to result in a transfer or assignment of assets or
liabilities from one entity to another.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 14.5 _ __Amendment of Partnership Agreement_.

 



 

Pursuant to Section 17-211(g) of the Delaware Act, an agreement of merger or
consolidation approved in accordance with Section 17-211(b) of the Delaware
Act may (a) effect any amendment to this Agreement or (b) effect the adoption
of a new partnership agreement for a limited partnership if it is the
Surviving Business Entity. Any such amendment or adoption made pursuant to
this Section 14.5 shall be effective at the effective time or date of the
merger or consolidation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XV 
RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 15.1 _ __Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time 90%
or more of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding
is held by the General Partner and its Affiliates, the General Partner shall
then have the right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in
part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable
at its option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Limited Partner
Interests of such class then Outstanding held by Persons other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market
Price as of the date three days prior to the date that the notice described in
Section 15 is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by a General Partner or
any of its Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such class
purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date that the notice
described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed. As used in this Agreement, (i) "
_Current Market Price,_ " as of any date of any class of Limited Partner
Interests listed or admitted to trading on any National Securities Exchange,
means the average of the daily Closing Prices (as hereinafter defined) per
limited partner interest of such class for the 20 consecutive Trading Days (as
hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; (ii) " _Closing Price_ "
for any day means the last sale price on such day, regular way, or in case no
such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices on such day, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal
consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or
admitted for trading on the principal National Securities Exchange on which
such Limited Partner Interests of such class are listed or admitted to trading
or, if such Limited Partner Interests of such class are not listed or admitted
to trading on any National Securities Exchange, the last quoted price on such
day or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices on
such day in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the Nasdaq or any
other system then in use, or, if on any such day such Limited Partner
Interests of such class are not quoted by any such organization, the average

market maker making a market in such Limited Partner Interests of such class
selected by the General Partner, or if on any such day no market maker is

value of such Limited Partner Interests on such day as determined by the
General Partner; and (iii) " _Trading Day_ " means a day on which the
principal National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests
of any class are listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of
business or, if Limited Partner Interests of a class are not listed or

banking institutions in New York City generally are open.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests
granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the General Partner shall deliver to the
Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the " _Notice of Election
to Purchase_ ") and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such
Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited Partner
Interests of such class or classes (as of a Record Date selected by the
General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, days prior to the Purchase
Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be published for a period
of at least three consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers of general
circulation printed in the English language and published in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the
Purchase Date and the price (determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at
which Limited Partner Interests will be purchased and state that the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, elects to
purchase such Limited Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates
representing such Limited Partner Interests in exchange for payment, at such
office or offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or
as may be required by any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited
Partner Interests are listed or admitted for trading. Any such Notice of
Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at
his address as reflected in the records of the Transfer Agent shall be
conclusively presumed to have been given regardless of whether the owner
receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the General Partner,
its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall deposit with the
Transfer Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase
price of all of such Limited Partner Interests to be purchased in accordance
with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been
duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on
or prior to the Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding sentence
has been made for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests
subject to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase Date,
notwithstanding that any Certificate shall not have been surrendered for
purchase, all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner Interests
(including any rights pursuant to Articles IV, V, VI, and XII) shall thereupon
cease, except the right to receive the purchase price (determined in
accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for Limited Partner Interests therefor,
without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates
representing such Limited Partner Interests, and such Limited Partner
Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General Partner,
its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record books of
the Transfer Agent and the Partnership, and the General Partner or any
Affiliate of the General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests from and
after the Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such Limited
Partner Interests (including all rights as owner of such Limited Partner
Interests pursuant to Articles IV, V, VI and XII).

 



 

(c) At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding
Limited Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1
may surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the
Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in Section
15.1(a), therefor, without interest thereon.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Article XIII to the contrary, this Article
cannot be amended without the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than
90% of the Outstanding Units.

or the Partnership of a change in his address) if they are available for the
Partner or Assignee at the principal office of the Partnership for a period of
one year from the date of the giving or making of such notice, payment or
report to the other Partners and Assignees. Any notice to the Partnership
shall be deemed given if received by the General Partner at the principal

document from a Partner or Assignee or other Person if believed by it to be
genuine.

Each Partner hereby expressly consents and agrees that, whenever in this
Agreement it is specified that an action may be taken upon the affirmative

relationship, other than this Agreement, that obligates it to vote, acquire or

creation of any Lien (other than under this Agreement) upon any of the

Shares) owned by such Stockholder under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
contract, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation of any kind to
which such Stockholder is a party or by which it or any of its respective
properties, rights or assets may be bound, (ii) violate any Law applicable to
such Stockholder or any of its properties, rights or assets, or (iii) result
in a violation or breach of or conflict with its organizational and governing
documents, except in the case of clause (i) as would not reasonably be

character except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (WITHOUT REFERENCE TO SUCH STATEÂ’S
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW). THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY (AND IF THE
DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY SHALL BE UNAVAILABLE, ANY DELAWARE STATE COURT AND
THE FEDERAL COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE) WILL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN
THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE AGREEMENTS, INSTRUMENTS AND DOCUMENTS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO ITS EXECUTION,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY
CONSENTS TO AND AGREES TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND
COMPLAINT AND ANY OTHER PROCESS IN ANY OTHER ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO
THE

PROPERTY, BY DELIVERY IN ANY METHOD CONTEMPLATED BY _SECTION 6.4_ HEREOF OR
IN ANY OTHER MANNER AUTHORIZED BY LAW, AND HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO
ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY CLAIM THAT (i) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF
SUCH COURTS, (ii) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYÂ’S PROPERTY IS IMMUNE FROM ANY
LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS OR (iii) ANY LITIGATION COMMENCED IN SUCH
COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 



 

(b) THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY
RIGHT WHICH ANY PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING,
LITIGATION OR COUNTERCLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS
(WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
ANY LAWSUIT IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY
TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PRESENT AS A NON-COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY SUCH
LAWSUIT ANY CLAIM BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK TO
CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Amendment; Waiver_. The obligations of any Stockholder hereunder
may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
Parent and by each Stockholder with respect to which such modification or
amendment will be effective. Each party may waive any right of such party
hereunder by an instrument in writing signed by such party and delivered to
the party benefiting from such waiver. No amendment or waiver shall be
permitted or effective without the prior written consent of the Company.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that money damages would not
be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is hereby agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1_ hereof, the parties hereto shall be
entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a
remedy for any such breach, to prevent breaches of this Agreement, and to
specifically enforce compliance with this Agreement. In connection with any
request for specific performance or equitable relief, each of the parties
hereto hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond
in connection with such remedy. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all
other remedies available at law or equity to such party. The parties further
agree that, by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 6.10_, no
party hereto shall in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including monetary
damages in the event that this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this _Section 6.10_ are not available or otherwise are not granted.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Severability_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any term
or provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is illegal,
void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any illegal, void, invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is legal, valid
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
illegal, void, invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement
shall be enforceable as so modified. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
in the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto shall replace such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve,
to the extent possible, the original economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in
the Merger Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the actions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties; __provided__ , __however__ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may transfer or assign their rights and obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or in part or from time to time in part, to one
or more of their Affiliates at any time. Any assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b) Other than the Company with respect to _Section 6.3_ hereof, this
Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto) any rights or remedies hereunder.
