Except as set forth in the corresponding schedule to the disclosure letter
delivered to Buyer by Seller on or prior to the date hereof (the " _Seller
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
schedule to the Seller Disclosure Letter shall also be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other Section of this _Article III_ to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent; _provided_ that no such disclosure shall be
deemed to qualify or limit the representations and warranties of Seller and
the Company set forth in _Section 3.6(b)_ of this Agreement unless expressly
set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter), each of
Seller and the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as set forth in
this _Article III_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor the
Company is making any representations or warranties in this Agreement with
respect to (a) the existence of any product Liability arising from the
research, development, manufacture, sale, advertising, distribution,
consuming, marketing or use of cigars or pipe tobacco products or (b) that

the Business Entities is listed on _Schedule 3.1(a)_ to the Seller
Disclosure Letter. Each Business Entity is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.
Each of the Business Entities (i) has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted and (ii) is in good standing and is duly qualified to
transact business in each other jurisdiction in which the nature of property
owned or leased by it or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except where the failure to be in good standing or to be duly
qualified to transact business would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.
Seller is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
the State of Delaware.



 

-11- (b) Each of Seller and the Company has the requisite corporate power to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery by Seller and the Company of this Agreement, the performance by
Seller and the Company of their respective obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Seller and the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by the respective Boards of Directors of
Seller and the Company, by the stockholders of Seller and by Seller in its
capacity as sole stockholder of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Seller or the Company, their respective Boards of
Directors or stockholders are necessary therefor. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller and the Company.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(c)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter
and, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), subject to obtaining the
consents set forth thereon, the execution, delivery and performance by Seller

Sellers or any Business Entitys respective certificate of incorporation or
by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents), (ii) violate in any material
respect any provision of, or be an event that is (or with the passage of time
will result in) a violation in any material respect by Seller or the Company
of, or result in the acceleration of or entitle any party to accelerate or
exercise (whether after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both) any
material right or obligation of the Seller or any Business Entity, under, or
result in the imposition of any Lien upon or the creation of a security
interest in any of the Shares or any Business Entitys assets or properties
pursuant to, any material agreement, instrument, order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Seller or any Business Entity is a party or by
which any of them is bound, or (iii) violate or conflict in any material
respect with any Law to which Seller or any Business Entity is subject.
Assuming the due execution of this Agreement by Buyer, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of Seller and the
Company, enforceable against Seller and the Company in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally
and to general principles of equity. At the Closing, the Escrow Agreement will
be duly executed and delivered by Seller, and, assuming the due execution and
delivery thereof by the other parties thereto, at the Closing the Escrow
Agreement will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general
principles of equity. Seller has provided to Buyer true and correct copies of

material real and personal property acquired by any Business Entity since the
date of the Business Balance Sheet that would, had it been acquired prior to

material leases and subleases (including all material amendments,
modifications and side letters thereto, and all notices of default and other
material notices thereunder) relating to the Business Real Property material
to the Business to which any of the Business Entities is a party, and all such

Seller Disclosure Letter, it being understood that for purposes of this
sentence, "material" shall mean any lease or sublease with total future
payments in excess of $1,000,000. There are no pending or, to Sellers or the
Companys knowledge, threatened condemnation proceedings relating to any of
the Business Real Property material to the Business. Except as disclosed on
_Schedule 3.5(a)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, none of the Business Real
Property material to the Business or any properties owned or leased by Seller
or any Continuing Affiliate is shared by any Business Entity, on the one hand,
and Seller or a Continuing Affiliate, on the other hand. 

(b) Immediately following the Closing, the Business Entities will own, lease
or have a valid license to use all of the assets, properties and rights
necessary to operate the Business as heretofore conducted and such assets,
properties and rights are sufficient in all material respects to operate the
Business in the manner heretofore operated, including all assets and
properties reflected on the Business Balance Sheet and assets and properties
acquired since the date of the Business Balance Sheet in the conduct of the
Business (except for properties disposed of in the ordinary course of business
since the date of the Business Balance Sheet). Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.5(b)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, following the Closing
neither Seller nor any Continuing Affiliate will have any ownership interest
in or right to use any asset described in the preceding sentence.

Section 3.6. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2006 through the
date hereof, (a) except as set forth on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ to the Seller
Disclosure Letter, the Business Entities have conducted the Business in the
ordinary course of business, (b) except as set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)_ to
the Seller Disclosure Letter there has been no change or development in or
effect on the Business that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have,
a Business Material Adverse Effect and (c) except as set forth on _Schedule
3.6(c)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, there has been no action taken by
Seller or any Business Entity prior to the date hereof which, if taken from
the date hereof through the Closing Date, would require the consent of Buyer
under any of the provisions of subsection (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi),
(ix) or (xiv) of _Section 5.4_; _provided_ , that, solely for this purpose,
each reference in clauses (v) and (vi) of _Section 5.4_ to $1 million and
$2 million, respectively, shall be deemed to be a reference to $5 million and
the proviso in _Section 5.4(v)(B)_ shall be disregarded.



 

-14- Section 3.7. _Litigation; Orders_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.7_ to
the Seller Disclosure Letter, there are no lawsuits, actions, administrative
or arbitration or other proceedings or (to the knowledge of the Seller or the
Company) governmental investigations pending or, to Sellers or the Companys
knowledge, threatened against any Business Entity that, if determined
adversely to the Business Entities, would, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Stock Purchase. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.7_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, there are no
material judgments or material outstanding orders, injunctions, decrees,
stipulations or awards (whether rendered by a court or administrative agency,
or by arbitration) against any Business Entity or any of their respective
properties or businesses.

Section 3.8. _Intellectual Property_. The Business Entities own, or are
validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all material Business
Intellectual Property Rights necessary for the conduct of the Business. No
Business Intellectual Property Right is subject to any outstanding judgment,
injunction, order or decree restricting the use thereof by the Business
Entities or restricting the licensing thereof by the Business Entities to any
Person, or any agreement so restricting in any material respect the use or
licensing thereof. To the knowledge of Seller and the Company, no Business
Entity is infringing in any material respect on any other Persons
Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge of Seller and the Company, no
Person is in infringing in any material respect on any Business Intellectual
Property Rights. No Business Entity is a defendant in any action, suit, or
proceeding relating to, or otherwise was notified of, any alleged material
claim of infringement of any Business Intellectual Property Right, and the
Business Entities have no outstanding material actions or suits for any
continuing infringement by any other Person of any Business Intellectual
Property Rights.  _Schedule 3.8_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of all United States and foreign patents and patent applications,
invention disclosure, trademark registrations and applications therefor,
registered copyrights and applications therefor included in the Business
Intellectual Property Rights and trade names of any of the Business Entities
that are material to the Business.

Section 3.9. _Licenses, Approvals, Other Authorizations, Consents, Reports,
etc_. (a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.9(a)_ to the Seller Disclosure
Letter, the Business Entities possess or have been granted all licenses,
permits, franchises, registrations and other authorizations of any
Governmental Authority (" _Licenses_ ") necessary to entitle them presently to
conduct the Business in the manner in which it is presently being
conducted, except those whose failure to possess or have been granted would
not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. All
Licenses possessed by or granted to any of the Business Entities and material
to the Business are in all material respects in full force and effect. No
proceeding is pending or, to Sellers or the Companys knowledge, threatened
seeking the revocation or limitation of any such material License.

(b) _Schedule 3.9(b)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a list of all
registrations, filings, applications, notices, consents, approvals, orders,
qualifications and waivers required to be made, filed, given or obtained by
Seller, its Subsidiaries or any Business Entity with, to or from any Persons
in connection with the consummation of the Stock Purchase and the other  



 

-15-  transactions required by this Agreement, except for those the failure of
which to make, file, give or obtain would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Stock Purchase.

Section 3.10. _Labor Matters_. None of the Business Entities is party to any
agreement with any labor unions or associations representing employees of any
of the Business Entities. No labor organization or group of employees of the
Business Entities has a pending demand for recognition or certification, and

a representation proceeding presently pending or, to the knowledge of the
Seller or the Company, threatened to be brought or filed, with the National
Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority. None
of the Business Entities is involved in or, to Sellers or the Companys
knowledge, threatened with any work stoppage, labor dispute, arbitration,
lawsuit or administrative proceeding relating to labor matters involving the
employees of any Business Entity (excluding routine workers compensation and
unemployment compensation claims) that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Business Entities is in compliance with all applicable
Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health, except for any
failure to be in compliance that would not individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 3.11. _Compliance with Laws_. The conduct by the Business Entities of
the Business complies in all material respects with all Laws applicable to
the Business Entities, it being understood that nothing set forth in this
_Section 3.11_ is intended to address compliance with any law that is the
subject of any other representation or warranty set forth in  _Section 3.9_,
_3.10_ , _3.15_ or _3.16_ or in _Article VII_.

Section 3.12. _Insurance_.  _Schedule 3.12_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter
lists all material insurance policies relating to fire and casualty, liability
and other forms of property and casualty insurance in effect as of the date
hereof and all such historic occurrence based policies written in the last
five years which cover any Business Entity or the Business Real Property to be

number and coverage limits. All such insurance policies are in full force and
effect (other than such historic occurrence based policies written in the last
five years), are valid and enforceable, and all premiums due thereunder have
been paid. In the last two (2) years, neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries (with respect to the Business) nor any Business Entity has
received written notice of cancellation or termination, other than in
connection with normal renewals, of any such insurance policy, and no claim is
pending as of the date of this Agreement under any such insurance policy

which any properties or assets of any of the Business Entities are subject; or
(h) other contract or agreement, entered into other than in the ordinary
course of business, requiring total future payments in excess of $1,000,000 or
which is otherwise material to the Business. The contracts required to be so
listed on _Schedule 3.13_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter are referred to
herein as " _Business Material Contracts_." With respect to all Business
Material Contracts, (i) none of the Business Entities, Seller or any
Continuing Affiliate, nor, except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ to the
Seller Disclosure Letter, to Sellers or the Companys knowledge, any other
party to any such Business Material Contract is in breach thereof or default
thereunder, and (ii) there does not exist any event that, with the giving
of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or
default by any Business Entity, Seller or any Continuing Affiliate, except for
such breaches, defaults and events which in the case of clauses (i) and (ii)
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date hereof, Seller
and the Company have made available to Buyer true and correct copies of all
Business Material Contracts. 

Section 3.14. _Brokers, Finders, etc_. Except for the services of the Seller
Financial Advisor, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finders or other similar fee, commission or expenses in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Seller, any Continuing Affiliate or any Business
Entity. Seller is solely responsible for such fees and expenses of the Seller
Financial Advisor.

Section 3.15.  _Environmental Compliance_. (a) Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, each Business Entity has
obtained all permits, licenses and other authorizations which are required
with respect to the operation of the Business Entities as presently conducted
under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to pollution or
protection of human health or the environment, including laws relating to
emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases or discharges of
hazardous, toxic or other pollutants, contaminants, chemicals or industrial
materials, including petroleum and petroleum-based products (hereinafter
referred to as " _Hazardous Materials_ ") into the environment (including,
without limitation, ambient air, surface water, ground water, land surface or
subsurface strata) or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing,
distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling
of Hazardous Materials; _provided_ , _however_ , that any applicable product
Liability laws governing the research, development, manufacture, sale,
advertising, distribution, consuming, marketing or use of cigars or pipe
tobacco products shall not be deemed to be an Environmental Law (the "
_Environmental Laws_ "), except where the failure to have obtained such
permits, licenses and other authorizations would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect.



 

-17- (b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter,
each of the Business Entities is presently conducting its business in
compliance with all terms and conditions of the permits, licenses and
authorizations required by the Environmental Laws, and is in compliance with
all other applicable limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards,
prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and timetables contained in
the Environmental Laws or contained in any regulation, code, plan, order,
decree, judgment, injunction, notice or demand letter issued,
entered, promulgated or approved thereunder applicable to the Business
Entities, except for such noncompliance which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material
Adverse Effect. There is no civil, criminal or administrative action, suit,
written demand, notice of violation, investigation known to Seller or the
Company, proceeding, written notice or demand letter pending relating to the
Business Real Property or business of any Business Entity or, to the
knowledge of Seller and the Company, threatened against the business or
Business Real Property of any Business Entity under Environmental Laws or any
code, plan, order, or decree, judgment, injunction, written notice or demand
letter issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder applicable to the
Business Entities, in each case that would, individually or in the aggregate,
have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

(c) To the knowledge of Seller and the Company and except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, with regard to any of
the Business Real Property, there are no past or present events, conditions,
circumstances, or future events, conditions or circumstances as to which
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has written notice, which would interfere
with or prevent, or would be reasonably likely to interfere with or prevent,
any Business Entity, based on the operation of the Business as presently
conducted, from complying in all material respects with Environmental Laws, or
which otherwise would be reasonably likely to form the basis of any material
claim, action, demand, proceeding or notice of violation, based on or related
to the emission, discharge, release or threatened release into the environment
of any Hazardous Material. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Business Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, none of the
Business Entities nor, to the knowledge of the Seller or the Company, any
other Person has buried, released, emitted, discharged, dumped or disposed of
any Hazardous Materials into the environment in quantities that would give
rise to material liability on the part of any Business Entity or require
cleanup by any Business Entity under Environmental Laws based on the operation
of the Business as presently conducted.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter and
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of
Seller and the Company, no cleanup has occurred at any Business Real Property,
which would result or reasonably be expected to result in the creation of a
Lien on such property by any Governmental Authority with respect thereto,
nor has any such assertion of a Lien been made by any Governmental Authority
with respect thereto.

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter,
and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries (with respect to  



 

-18-  the Business) nor any of the Business Entities has received any written
notice from any Governmental Authority or private or public entity or
individual requesting information in connection with a possible violation of
Environmental Laws or advising it that it is in non-compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws, or responsible for, or potentially responsible for, costs
with respect to a release, a threatened release or clean-up of Hazardous
Materials generated, stored, treated, disposed of or transported by any
Business Entity, and (ii) no Business Entity has entered into any agreement
for the clean-up of any Hazardous Materials. 

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, to
the knowledge of Seller and the Company, none of the Business Real Property
material to the Business includes any equipment, machinery, device, or other
apparatus that contains polychlorinated biphenyls that is now or ever has been
leaking in any material respect that requires removal or remediation based on
continued operation of the Business Entities as presently conducted; any
asbestos or asbestos-containing material that requires removal, remediation or
abatement based on continued operation of the Business Entities as presently
conducted; any "waters of the United States" determined by Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Governmental Authority to be subject to any legal
requirement or restriction under Environmental Laws related to wetlands,
wetlands buffer, stream buffer or transition areas or open waters; or any
underground storage tank, unregistered above ground storage tank, surface
impoundment, septic tank, pit, swamp or lagoon in which Hazardous Materials
are being or have been treated, stored, or disposed of in violation of
applicable Environmental Laws, in each case that would give rise to any
material liability on the part of any Business Entity.

Section 3.16. _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) _Schedule 3.16(a)_ to the Seller
Disclosure Letter contains a list (under appropriate headings) of each
material Employee Plan and Business Material Employment Arrangement and
designates each of which is an Employee Plan, Company Plan, Seller Plan (as
defined in _Section 6.1(g)_) and Business Material Employment Arrangement.
With respect to each material Employee Plan and Business Material Employment
Arrangement, Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer a true, correct
and complete copy of: (i) each such Employee Plan or Business Material
Employment Arrangement document (or a summary of any unwritten Employee
Plan or Business Material Employment Arrangement), trust agreement and
insurance contract or other funding vehicle; (ii) the most recent Annual
Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the current
summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if any (in
each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (iv) the most
recent annual financial report, if any; (v) the most recent actuarial report,
if any; and (vi) the most recent determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), if any. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company has any commitment or obligation to establish or
adopt any, or enter into any, new or additional Employee Plans or Business
Material Employment Agreement or to increase the benefits under any existing
Employee Plan, other than the Severance Plan (as defined in _Section 6.1(e)_)
and the bonus and retention arrangement (as described on _Schedule 5.4(viii)_
to the Seller Disclosure Letter) (" _Bonus Plan_ ").

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(b)_ to the Seller Disclosure
Letter, none of the Business Entities, any predecessor of any of the Business
Entities sponsors or any of their ERISA Affiliates, maintains or contributes
to, or has in the past six years sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any
Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (a  



 

-19-  " _Title IV Plan_"). No Company Plan is a Title IV Plan. With respect to
any Title IV Plan, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of such
Title IV Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued
benefits under such Title IV Plan (whether or not vested) on an accumulated
benefits obligation basis (consistent with FAS No. 35 as amended) based on the
most recent actuarial report for each such plan; and (iii) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the
consummation of the Stock Purchase will not result in the occurrence of any
such reportable event. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(b)_ , no
Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by any Business Entity nor do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in Controlled
Group Liability for any of the Business Entities following the Closing by
reason of such Business Entities having been an ERISA Affiliate of Seller (or
of any other ERISA Affiliate of Seller) prior to the Closing. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all
liabilities (i) under Section 302(f) or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Sections
412(n) or 4971 of the Code and (iv) for a material violation of the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code or the group health requirements of Sections 9801 et
seq. of the Code and Sections 701 et seq. of ERISA.

(c) None of the Company, any predecessor of any of the Business Entities nor
any of their ERISA Affiliates contributes to or is obligated to contribute to,
or has in the past six years contributed to, or has been obligated to
contribute to, any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA
(each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") and no Employee Plan is a Multiemployer
Plan. None of the Business Entities or any of their ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in
Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, that has not been satisfied in
full. With respect to each such Multiemployer Plan, none of the Business
Entities has received any written notification, nor, to the knowledge of
Seller and the Company, has any reason to believe, that any such Multiemployer
Plan is in reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent, or may
reasonably be expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be
terminated.

(d) Except as set forth on  _Schedule 3.16(d)_ to the Seller Disclosure
Letter, each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received the most recently available favorable
determination letter (under the "GUST" or "EGTRAA" round of filings), or has
pending an application for such determination from the IRS, and Seller and the
Company have no knowledge as to why any such determination letter should be
revoked or not be reissued. The Seller shall take, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all reasonably actions to preserve the qualification of
each Employee Plan, which has heretofore been intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, with Section 401(a) of the Code. No Employee Plan
or related funding vehicle from which the Employee Plan benefits are paid is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Each
Employee Plan and each Employment Agreement has been maintained in compliance
in all material respects with its terms and with the requirements prescribed
by all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code,
which are applicable to such Employee Plan or Employment Agreement. All
contributions required to be made to any Employee Plan by applicable Law or by
any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or
payable with  



 

-20-  respect to insurance policies funding any Employee Plan, have been timely
made or accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP and applicable U.S. Department
of Labor Regulations or if there has been any failure to make such
contribution, such failure or failures shall not, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect. No events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in payment or assessment by or against any
Business Entity of any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976,
4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E, 4980F or 5000 of the Code. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of Seller and the Company, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits,
investigations, audits or arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted
against any one or more of the Employee Plans, any, to the knowledge of
Seller and the Company, fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to
the Employee Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Employee Plans, which would reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of any Business Entity to the PBGC, the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any Employee Plan, any participant in
an Employee Plan or any other party.

(e) _Schedule 3.16(e)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list of all material funded and material unfunded non-qualified deferred
compensation arrangements payable now or in the future to each current and
former employee or director of any Business Entity, or any other Person with
respect to which any Business Entity has any current liability or may have
Liability prior to or immediately following the consummation of the Stock
Purchase (collectively, the " _Deferred Compensation Arrangements_ "), which
schedule shall include the name and title or position of each such Person, the
amount payable to such Person, the payment terms applicable thereto, and
whether funded or unfunded and, if funded, a brief description of such
funding. The Liability associated with each Deferred Compensation Arrangement
has been properly accrued and accounted for on the Business Financial
Statements. Each Employee Plan is either exempt from or has been operated and
maintained in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Each
Deferred Compensation Arrangement that is subject to Section 409A of the Code
has been amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code to the extent
required by applicable guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury and
Internal Revenue Service to avoid taxes under Section 409A of the Code
presently and in the future (based on the law in effect and guidance provided
on or before the date hereof), after taking into account any extension to make
any required amendments to comply with Code Section 409A and
applicable regulations. No Business Entity has any Liability for, or
obligation to, indemnify any Person with respect to any Liability that has
been or may be imposed on such Person under Sections 409A or 280G of the Code.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(f)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter
or in the Severance Plan or Bonus Plan, no Business Entity has any current or
projected material Liability in respect of post employment or post retirement
health, medical, life insurance or other welfare benefits for retired, former
or current employees and/or directors of any Business Entity except
as otherwise required by Law.

(g) There are no Employee Plans that are subject to the Laws of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States. 



 

-21- (h) Seller has made available to Buyer a true and complete list, as of October
31, 2007, of each Business Key Person, his or her current rate of annual base
salary or current wages, 2007 bonus target, job title, employment status, work
location and credited service date, fiscal year 2006 bonus, fiscal year 2005
bonus and date of hire. No Business Key Person has given notice to terminate
employment. Upon request, Seller shall make available to the Buyer information
concerning other employees of the Business Entities other than Business Key
Persons that is comparable to the information described above with respect to
Business Key Persons.

(i) _Schedule 3.16(i)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of each Employee Plan under which the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Stock Purchase or actions or transactions
required by the Agreement will result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
funding or delivery of, or materially increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit (including the forgiveness of indebtedness) to any
employee, officer, Individual Consultant or director of any Business Entity,
or could limit the right of any Business Entity to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any Employee Plan or related trust or any
Business Material Employment Arrangement or related trust.

Section 3.17. _Non-Reliance_. Seller acknowledges that the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article IV_ , and the representations and warranties
of Buyer set forth in Article 13 of the Escrow Agreement and the Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive

the transactions contemplated hereby, and Seller acknowledges and agrees that
Buyer is not making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or the Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement. Seller further
acknowledges and agrees that (a) except and solely to the extent of the
representations and warranties in _Article IV_, Buyer has made no
representation or warranty either express or implied as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Buyer and its Affiliates furnished
or made available to Seller, the Company and/or their respective

and warranties in _Article IV_, Seller shall have no claim or right to
indemnification pursuant to _Articles VII_ or _IX_ with respect to any
information, documents or materials furnished by Buyer, any of its Affiliates
or any of its representatives to Seller or the Company in any materials or
information furnished in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.17_, nothing
herein is intended to or shall limit or otherwise restrict any claim by or
right of Seller with respect to or arising from any intentional
misrepresentation or fraud.

ARTICLE IV __

_Representations and Warranties of Buyer_

Except as set forth in the corresponding schedule to the disclosure letter
delivered to Seller by Buyer on or prior to the date hereof (the " _Buyer
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any

business in each other jurisdiction in which the nature of property owned or
leased by it or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified,
except where the failure to be in good standing or to be duly qualified to

Buyer to consummate the Stock Purchase or would otherwise prevent the
performance of the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement (a " _Buyer
Material Adverse Effect_ ").

(b) Buyer has the requisite corporate power to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by Buyer of this

violate any provision of Buyers certificate of incorporation or by-laws, (ii)
violate any provision of, or be an event that is (or with the passage of time
will result in) a violation of, or result in the acceleration of or entitle
any party to accelerate or exercise (whether after the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both) any obligation or right under, or result in the
imposition of any Lien upon or the creation of a security interest in any
shares of capital stock of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or any of Buyers assets
or properties pursuant to, any agreement, instrument, order, arbitration
award, judgment or decree to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is

ARTICLE V

_Covenants of the Parties_  

Section 5.1. _Investigation of Business; Access to Properties and Records_.
(a) From the date hereof through the Closing, Seller and the Company shall,
and shall cause the Business Entities to, afford to Buyer and Buyers
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during
regular business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the
offices, plants, properties, books and records and to employees of the
Business Entities and, to the extent related to the Business, Seller and its
Subsidiaries, and their respective agents and consultants, in order that Buyer
may make reasonable investigations of the affairs of the Business and the
Business Entities. The foregoing shall not require Seller, the Company or any
Seller Subsidiary to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Person is reasonably
likely to (i) result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege (it being
understood that Seller and its Subsidiaries will enter into one or more
appropriate joint defense agreements or similar protective arrangements if
such agreements or arrangements would permit such inspection or disclosure
without waiver of such privilege), the disclosure of any trade secrets or the
violation of any Law or (ii) violate any of their obligations owed to any
third party with respect to confidentiality if Seller, the Company or any
Seller Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure. The Seller and the Company shall not be required, nor shall
Seller nor the Company be required to cause the Business Entities or any
Seller Subsidiary, to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.1(a)_
beyond commercially reasonable efforts or that would unreasonably disrupt
their respective normal operations.

(b) Any information provided to Buyer or its representatives pursuant to
_Section 5.1(a)_ prior to the Closing shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement dated January 9, 2007 between Buyer and Seller (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer will cooperate to identify, and
will reasonably agree upon a plan pursuant to which Seller will deliver (or
will deliver control with respect to), the Books and Records to the Business
Entities, it being understood that a portion of the Books and Records will be
so delivered as of the Closing Date and a portion of the Books and Records
will be so delivered as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date.

(d) Following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
(i) afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access during regular business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, to any books and records retained by Seller or its Subsidiaries that
relate in part to the operations of the Business Entities (but that are not
Books and Records that must be delivered to Buyer on or before the Closing),
but such access  



 

-25-  need be given only with respect to the portion of such books and records as
are related to the operations, or the financial, accounting, tax or
legal condition, of the Business Entities or the Business, provided that such
access to such books and records shall not unreasonably interfere with the
Sellers or its Subsidiaries business operations and provided that the
foregoing shall not require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to permit any
access that in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Person is reasonably
likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or the
violation of any applicable Law and (ii) maintain such books and records (and
make available for examination and copying by the Buyer at the Buyers
expense) for a period of not less than five years following the Closing Date.
Upon Buyers request and at Buyers expense, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, provide Buyer with copies of the portions of such books
and records that relate to the operations of the Business Entities.

(e) Following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Business Entities
to, (i) allow the Seller and its Subsidiaries, upon reasonable prior notice
and during regular business hours, through their employees and
representatives, to examine and make copies (at the Sellers or such
Subsidiaries expense) of the Books and Records transferred to the Buyer at
the Closing or created prior to Closing and in the possession of the Business
Entities for any reasonable business purpose relating to their respective
businesses, including the preparation or examination of Tax Returns,
regulatory filings and financial statements, compliance with any applicable
Law or their obligations under this Agreement and the conduct of any
litigation or the conduct of any regulatory, contract holder, participant or
other dispute resolution whether pending or threatened, provided that such
access to such Books and Records shall not unreasonably interfere with the
Business Entities or their Affiliates business operations and provided that
the foregoing shall not require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to permit
any access that in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Person is
reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege or
the violation of any applicable Law and (ii) maintain such books and records
(and make available for examination and copying by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries at the Sellers or such Subsidiaries expense) for a period of

information which would be considered "Information" pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement) or (ii) waive any provision of any confidentiality
agreement to which it is a party to the extent it relates to the Business or
the Business Entities. Effective as of the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate automatically and shall thereafter be of no
further force and effect. From and after the Closing, neither Buyer nor any

Section 5.2. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) Each of the parties
hereto agrees to cooperate and use (and to cause their respective

as practicable to (i) take or cause to be taken all action, and to do or cause
to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and any applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Stock

submissions, and to obtain as promptly as is practicable all consents,
approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, authorizations, registrations,
qualifications, decisions, determinations or other permissions or actions
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority or any
other Person in order to consummate the Stock Purchase (including to
obtain expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or
any clearance as may be required under such other Law for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (ii) provide all such
information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries and its officers,
directors, employees, partners and Affiliates as may be necessary or
reasonably requested in connection with any of the foregoing; (iii) avoid the
issuance or entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order,
injunction, judgment, decision or determination that would, in whole or in
part, restrain, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Stock
Purchase; and (iv) enter into such agreements with any Governmental Authority
to divest assets as may be necessary to obtain approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not
be required to take any such action or actions specified in clause (i), (iii)
or (iv) that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact
the Business or the businesses of Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
and _provided_ _further_ that Seller shall not, nor shall it cause or permit
any of the Business Entities to, divest or dispose of any plants, assets or
businesses pursuant to the obligations of _Section 5.2(a)(iv)_ without the
prior consent of Buyer. Filing fees required in connection with any filings
under the HSR Act or with any Governmental Authority under any other
applicable competition law shall be borne by Buyer.

(b) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable to consult with the other parties on, all the information relating
to the Business Entities or Buyer, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Stock Purchase and any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as is practicable.

(c) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall keep the
other parties reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by such parties or any of their respective Affiliates from any third Person
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

-27- (d) Seller shall, and shall cause Shareholder to, enter into the Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement on the Closing Date.

Section 5.3. _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, the parties hereto
agree that, from time to time, each of them will execute and deliver such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as
may be necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree
that:

(a) Following the Closing, to the extent any assets or rights of the Business
have been retained by Seller and the Continuing Affiliates, Seller shall and
shall cause the Continuing Affiliates to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to convey such assets or rights to the Business Entities as promptly
as practicable (and pending such conveyance to provide the Business Entities
with the benefit of such assets).

(b) To the extent any real property or other assets or facilities, or any
rights or services (including but not limited to Sellers letter of credit
facility for workers compensation coverage for employees of the Business
Entities and the Seller and its Subsidiaries or their predecessors), are
shared or used jointly by the Business Entities, on the one hand, and the
Seller and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to reach equitable arrangements under which such real
property, assets, facilities, rights and services will cease to be shared at
or prior to the Closing. To the extent this is not possible, the parties will
mutually agree in good faith on reasonable transition arrangements that will
allow such sharing to cease as soon as practicable following the Closing.
Seller agrees to cause the Sellers Subsidiaries to provide such transition
services as may reasonably be requested by Buyer for mutually agreed
compensation, for a reasonable period, in order to assist in the smooth
transition of the Business (such services to be of a scope no more extensive
than the services provided by such Sellers Subsidiaries to the Business
Entities as of the date hereof).

Section 5.4. _Conduct of Business_. Each of Seller and the Company agrees, as
to each of the Business Entities, that, from the date hereof until the
Closing, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4_ to the Seller Disclosure

taken pursuant to _Section 5.2_, (ii) transactions contemplated by  _Section
5.12_ or (iii) as required by applicable Law), or as otherwise agreed to in
writing by those representatives of Buyer set forth on _Schedule 5.4_ to the
Buyer Disclosure Letter (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), the Business Entities shall conduct the Business in the ordinary
course of business and, to the extent consistent therewith (and subject to the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4_), the Business Entities
will use their commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and maintain in
all material respects existing relations and goodwill with employees,
customers, brokers, suppliers and other Persons with which the Business
Entities have significant business relations. Without limiting the foregoing,
from the date hereof until the Closing, except as set forth on _Schedule 5.4_

unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company shall not and shall cause the
other Business Entities not to, and Seller shall cause each of the Business
Entities not to, directly or indirectly do, or commit or agree to do, any of
the following:

any share of its capital stock other than dividends and other distributions

agreements and letters of comfort given by Seller or any of its Continuing
Affiliates for the sole benefit of the Business Entities, which guaranties,
performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnification agreements and letters
of comfort are set forth on _Schedule 5.6(b)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter
(each a " _Seller Guaranty_ "). Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause itself or one or more of the Continuing Affiliates to be
substituted in all respects for any Business Entity, effective as of the
Closing, in respect of all obligations of any Business Entity under
each guaranty, bonding arrangement, letter of credit and letter of comfort
given by any of the Business Entities for the benefit of Seller or any of the

efforts (and to cause its Affiliates to use their commercially reasonable
efforts) to maintain each such Seller Guaranty or Non-Business Guaranty, as
the case may be, in place until the expiration of the then-current term of the

Guaranty or Non-Business Guaranty in accordance with its terms (it being
understood that after each such expiration, Seller and its Affiliates shall
have no obligation to renew any such Seller Guaranty and Buyer and
its Affiliates shall have no obligation to renew any such Non-Business
Guaranty).

Section 5.7. _No Solicitation_. (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not, and shall
cause the Business Entities and its other Affiliates and its and their
employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Seller Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate, entertain,
consider, encourage, accept or otherwise facilitate any inquiries (including
by way of furnishing any non-public information or otherwise) or the making of
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person which constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal (or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " means any direct or indirect inquiry, proposal or
offer (or any improvement, restatement, amendment, renewal or reiteration
thereof) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any
capital stock of or other equity interest in, or any significant portion of
the businesses of, any of the Business Entities or a merger, consolidation or
other business combination transaction involving the Business Entities or a
sale of any significant portion of the assets (other than sales of products in

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or requested by Buyer in
connection with any actions taken pursuant to _Section 5.2_.

Section 5.8. _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. Seller or the Company shall
promptly (but in any event within one Business Day) notify Buyer orally and
in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry regarding the making of
any Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name

and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

Section 5.9. _Insurance_. (a) From the date hereof to the Closing, Buyer and
Seller will cooperate reasonably to facilitate Buyers development and
implementation of a transition plan with respect to insurance coverage for the
Business Entities, including, without limitation, the provision by the
Company, Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, of information
reasonably requested by Buyer regarding historical coverage and claims with
respect to the Business Entities and the Business.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts,
subject to the terms of the Seller Insurance Policies, to retain the right
to make claims and receive recoveries for the benefit of the Business
Entities under any property and casualty insurance policies maintained at any
time prior to the Closing by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or the
predecessors  



 

-32-  of any of them that provide coverage on an "occurrence" rather than a
"claims made" basis (collectively, the " _Seller Insurance Policies_ "),
covering any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense relating to the assets,
business, operations, conduct, products and employees (including former
employees) of any of the Business Entities and their respective
predecessors (in each case, in so far as they cover or otherwise relate to
the Business or otherwise relate to losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses as to which any of the Business Entities could have responsibility)
that relates to or arises out of occurrences prior to or at the Closing (an "
_Insurance Claim_ ").

(c) Buyer or the applicable Business Entity will pay, incur and bear all
amounts relating to any self-retention or deductible and any gaps in or limits
on coverage applicable to an Insurance Claim asserted at any time with respect
to the applicable Seller Insurance Policy and the coverage available with
respect to any Insurance Claim shall be the actual coverage available under
such Seller Insurance Policy at the time the Insurance Claim is made, taking
into account the effect of any prior claim payments on any self-retention or
deductible or in causing any gap or limits on coverage under the terms of
such Seller Insurance Policy, whether or not the applicable Seller Insurance
Policy solely covers claims of the Business Entities or covers claims of both
Seller and its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Business Entities on the
other hand. In the event that any legal action, arbitration, negotiation or
other proceedings are required for coverage to be asserted against any insurer
for an Insurance Claim to be perfected under the Seller Insurance Policies,
in each case on behalf of any of the Business Entities, (i) Buyer shall, to
the extent possible, do so at its own expense or at the expense of the
applicable Business Entity or (ii) if Buyer is not permitted to assert
coverage or perfect an Insurance Claim, Seller or one of its Subsidiaries
shall do so, and, in either event, Buyer or the applicable Business Entity
shall reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries for any reasonable costs and
expenses that they may incur because of such action (other than the
incurrence of normal internal administrative expenses).

(d) Each of Seller, Buyer and the Business Entities shall use its reasonable
best efforts (i) to cooperate fully and to cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate
fully with the others in submitting good faith Insurance Claims on behalf of
the Business Entities under the Seller Insurance Policies and (ii) to pay
promptly over to Buyer (or, at Buyers request, to the applicable Business
Entities) any and all amounts received by Seller or its Subsidiaries under the
Seller Insurance Policies with respect to Insurance Claims.

(e) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall retain custody for at least five years
from the Closing Date of the Seller Insurance Policies and any and all
service contracts, claim settlements and all other insurance records relating
thereto; and Buyer and the Business Entities shall have access to and the
right to make copies of all such documents and records upon reasonable
request to Seller or the Continuing Affiliates.

Section 5.10. _Indebtedness; Working Capital; Related Matters_. (a) Seller
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Closing Date, the
Business Entities shall not have any Indebtedness except as contemplated by
_Section 5.6(c)_ or as set forth on _Schedule 5.10_ to the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

(b) Seller covenants and agrees that (i) the Working Capital as of the Closing
(" _Closing Working Capital_ ") shall be no less than $32.4 million and (ii)
as of the Closing the  



 

-33-  Business Entities shall have freely available cash, in excess of any cash
required to satisfy Sellers obligations pursuant to the foregoing clause
(i), in an amount (the " _Closing Date Cash_ ") equal to the sum of (A) the
product of (x) $4.75 million and (y) a ratio, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days up to but not including the Closing Date which shall
have elapsed in the calendar year in which the Closing occurs and the
denominator of which is 365, plus (B) if the Closing occurs after December 31,
2007 and before payment of employee profit sharing bonuses with respect to
2007, $4.75 million.

(c) Following the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement, certified by the
chief financial officer of the Company, of the estimated Closing Working
Capital and the Closing Date Cash, which statement of estimated Closing
Working Capital and Closing Date Cash shall contain no less detail than
reflected on _Schedule 1.3_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter. Following receipt
of such statement, Seller shall, and shall cause its advisors to, consult with
Buyer and its advisors on the calculation of Closing Working Capital and
Closing Date Cash and shall provide or cause to be provided to Buyer
information reasonably requested to support the basis on which the statement
was prepared. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to resolve any disputes as to
such calculation prior to the Closing.

(d) Following Sellers receipt of notice from Buyer of such amount becoming
due and payable by any of the Business Entities, Seller shall pay to the
Company an amount in cash equal to the amount owing by the Business Entities
for tobacco quota buyout assessments in respect of any pre-Closing periods or
that portion of any such amount owing that relates to the pre-Closing portion
of any period. Seller shall make such payment promptly, but in any event not
later than five Business Days prior to the date any such amount becomes due
and payable, by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account
specified in such notice.

Section 5.11. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Related Matters_.

(a) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.11(a)_, from and after
the Closing Date for a period of six years, the provisions of
the certificates or articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Business
Entities concerning the elimination of liability and indemnification of
directors and officers shall not be amended in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any person who is, as of the date hereof or
as of the Closing Date, a current or former officer or director of any
Business Entity. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.11(a)_, from
and after the Closing Date for a period of six years, each of the Business
Entities and Buyer (the " _D andO Indemnitors_") shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Person who is, or as of the Closing Date will be, a current or
former officer or director of any Business Entity (the " _D andO Indemnitees_")
against all Covered Losses arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions
(or alleged acts or omissions) of the DandO Indemnitees, or any of them, in
their capacities as such to the maximum extent permitted by the Law
applicable to the relevant Business Entity, subject to the DandO Indemnitors
receipt of an undertaking by such DandO Indemnitee to repay such Covered Losses
paid in advance if it is ultimately determined that such DandO Indemnitee is
not entitled to be so indemnified under applicable Law; _provided_ _however_ ,
that the DandO Indemnitors will not in any event be liable for any settlement
effected without the DandO Indemnitors prior written consent and will not in
any event be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(selected by a plurality of the DandO Indemnitees) for all DandO Indemnitees in  



 

-34-  any jurisdiction with respect to a single proceeding, except to the extent
that two or more of such DandO Indemnitees shall have conflicting interests
in the outcome of, or differing defenses available with respect to, such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation that make such joint
representation inadvisable. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section
5.11(a)_, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the
indemnification hereunder shall be mandatory rather than permissive, and each
of the Business Entities, as applicable, shall promptly advance expenses in
connection with such indemnification to the extent permitted under applicable
Law. In the event any Business Entity or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, appropriate provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of any Business Entity, or at the
Buyers option, the Buyer, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.11(a)_. The DandO Indemnitors shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that a DandO Indemnitee may incur in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this _Section
5.11(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.11(a)_,
no indemnification shall be available pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this  _Section 5.11(a)_ for any Covered Losses in respect of or arising from
any claim by any shareholder of a Business Entity that was a shareholder prior
to the Closing, whether such claim is brought directly in such capacity or in
the nature of a derivative action or otherwise.

(b) Effective upon the Closing, Seller, for itself and its successors and
assigns, hereby remises, releases and forever discharges each of the DandO
Indemnitees of and from any and all claims which Seller now has, ever had, or
at the Closing may have, or hereafter can, shall or may have against the DandO
Indemnitees or any of them, for upon or by reason of any matter, cause or
thing whatsoever, from the beginning of time through the Closing Date.

(c) Effective upon the Closing, Buyer and the Business Entities, and each of
their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Releasing
Parties_ "), hereby remises, releases and forever discharges the individuals
set forth on _Schedule 5.11(c)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter (the " _D andO
Released Parties_") of and from any and all claims which the Releasing
Parties, or any of them, now have, ever had, or at the Closing may have, or
hereafter can, shall or may have against the DandO Released Parties or any of
them, for upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever, from the
beginning of time through the Closing Date; _provided_ _however_ , that the
Releasing Parties shall not be deemed to have remised, released or discharged
any DandO Released Party from (x) any breach in any material respect of any
obligations of confidentiality with respect to any proprietary processes or
other significant proprietary information of any Business Entity, however and
whenever arising, or (y) intentional misconduct or fraud.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section 5.11_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each DandO Indemnitee and DandO Released
Party, as applicable, and each such Persons heirs, representatives,
successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.11_, and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other right to indemnification or
contribution that any such DandO Indemnitee or DandO Released Party may have by
contract, bylaw or otherwise.



 

-35- Section 5.12. _Transfer of Limerick Property_. Seller shall cause Atlantic

employees of the Business Entities employed as of the Closing Date who
continue to be employed following the Closing Date (including any
individual(s) on a Company approved leave of absence or currently receiving
workers compensation who have been identified on _Schedule 3.16(d)_ to the
Seller Disclosure Letter) (the " _Employees_ ") with base compensation no less
than the base compensation in effect for such Employee immediately prior to
the Closing. The term " _Employees_ " shall not include any employees or
former employees of the Business Entities who prior to the Closing Date have
retired, or have otherwise terminated employment. For one year following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain employee benefit plans, programs and
policies which provide benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided under the Employee Plans of the Business Entities
in effect on the Closing Date (but excluding equity-based compensation
plans); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall prevent the termination or amendment of any employee benefit plan,
program or policy or limit the right of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
terminate the employment of any employee at any time.

(b) _Service Credit_. To the extent permitted by Law, Employees shall be given
credit under each employee benefit plan, compensation program, policy or
arrangement (including, but not limited to, pension, severance, including
the Severance Plan, vacation, health and welfare, incentive bonus and equity-
based plans) of Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which the Employees are
eligible to participate for all service with any Business Entity and their
ERISA Affiliates (to the extent such credit was given by the Business Entity
or such ERISA Affiliates applicable employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement) for purposes of eligibility and vesting, provided that no such
service shall be recognized for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit plan or where such service recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits to an Employee (or his or her beneficiaries or
dependents).

(c) _Employee Benefit Transition_. Buyer shall waive pre-existing condition
requirements, evidence of insurability provisions, waiting
period requirements or any similar provisions for any Employees under any
medical, dental, disability or life insurance plan maintained or sponsored by
or contributed to by Buyer for such individuals after the Closing Date, other
than pre-existing conditions and evidence of insurability that would have
been applicable under the Employee Plans. Buyer shall also apply towards any
deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits under such plans any
amounts paid (or accrued) by each Employee under the Business Entitys
comparable benefit plans during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.



 

-36- (d) _COBRA_. Following the Closing Date, Buyer will be responsible for
satisfying obligations under Section 601 _et_ _seq_. of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code (" _COBRA Coverage_ ") and any applicable similar state
laws, to provide such COBRA Coverage to or with respect to any Employee in
accordance with such law with respect to any "qualifying event," and COBRA
coverage with respect to any employee or former employee of a Business Entity
who had a qualifying event prior to Closing with respect to a health claim
incurred on or after the Closing Date; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall be responsible for satisfying any COBRA Coverage
obligations to, or with respect to any Employee or former employee of a
Business Entity, under any health care flexible spending account (without
regard to whether such individuals may receive similar coverage under an
arrangement to maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates.

(e) _Severance_. For at least one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to provide, severance benefits
to all Employees pursuant to a plan or arrangement (the " _Severance Plan_ ")
which shall be substantially in the form and provide severance benefits at
least equal to the level of benefits described on _Schedule 6.1(e)_ to the
Seller Disclosure Letter. Any severance costs which arise under the
Severance Plan shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer.

(f) _No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights_. Except as provided in  _Section
11.4_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall create a third-
party beneficiary relationship or otherwise confer any benefit, entitlement,
or right upon any person or entity other than the parties hereto,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever. Nothing in this Agreement shall
cause duplicate benefits to be paid or provided to or with respect to any
employee under any employee benefit policies, plans, arrangements, programs,
practices, or agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to
any Employee Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose.

(g) _Plans Not Sponsored by Business Entities_. Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall be responsible for all benefits and liabilities under any Employee Plan
that is not a Company Plan (each, a " _Seller Plan_ "). Seller shall take all
actions necessary and appropriate to ensure that as of the Closing Date (i)
all Employees shall cease to accrue benefits under Seller Plans, including
timely providing Employees with any and all notices required by applicable Law
to cause such cessation of benefit accruals, (ii) each Employee shall be fully
vested in his or her benefits under any Plan that is an employee
pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (whether or
not such plan is subject to ERISA), and (iii) the Business Entities shall
withdraw from participation in any Seller Plans. Seller shall take all actions
necessary such that none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have any
Liability with respect to any Seller Plan. Seller shall cause itself or the
applicable Continuing Affiliate to assume and be solely responsible for any
Liability related to severance or other employee payment arising solely as a
result of the consummation of the Stock Purchase under applicable Law or any
Contract with an employee in effect prior to the Closing.

(h) _Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the Buyer to provide, (i) such current
information regarding the Employees and former employees of the Business on an
ongoing basis as may be reasonably necessary to facilitate determinations of
eligibility for, and payments of benefits to, the Employees  



 

-37-  under the employee benefit plans of the Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii)
information regarding the accrued benefit under any Plan that is an
employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA). Subject to such partys
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, each party shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, permit Employees to provide such assistance to the other
party as may be necessary in respect of claims against the Business Entities,
whether asserted or threatened, to the extent that, (a) an employee of such
party or one of its Subsidiaries has knowledge of relevant facts or issues,
or (b) assistance by an employee of such party or one of its Subsidiaries is
reasonably necessary in respect of any such claim.

-39- (ii) any liability for Taxes of Seller and any Subsidiary of Seller allocable

Taxes are taken into account in the Working Capital calculation or otherwise
taken into account under _Section 5.10(b)_, (ii) Taxes that arise from or in

is contested in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.6_,  



 

-40-  payment of the Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority will be considered to
be due no earlier than the date a final determination (a " _Final
Tax Determination_ ") to such effect is made by the appropriate Taxing

payment shall be made to the affected Tax Indemnitee within thirty (30) days
of receiving notification of the Tax Claim (or if later, a Final Tax

(e) From and after the Closing, Seller will retain an amount of net assets
reasonably sufficient, in the good faith judgment of Seller, to satisfy its

Section 7.3. _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. (a) If any of the Business

that day as the last day of a taxable period.

(b) In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of any of the Business
Entities that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, except as
provided in _Section 7.3(c)_, the allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-
Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period shall be made on the basis of an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.

(c) In the case of (i) franchise Taxes based on capitalization, debt or
shares of stock authorized, issued or outstanding and (ii) ad valorem Taxes,
in either case attributable to a Straddle Period (as defined below), the
portion of such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable period, multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in such taxable period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
entire number of calendar days in such taxable period, and the balance of such
Taxes shall be attributable to the Post-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any property, asset or other right of any of the Business Entities
is sold or otherwise transferred prior to the Closing, then ad valorem Taxes
pertaining to such property, asset or other right shall be attributed entirely
to the Pre-Closing Period, and _provided_ _further_ , that in the case of any
Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-term debt)
or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated under this
_Section 7.3(c)_ shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on
the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the past practices of
the Seller and the Business Entities.

to in _Section 5.12_ shall be borne solely by Seller.

Section 7.4. _Refunds and Related Matters_. (a) Any refund or credit of Taxes
(including any interest thereon) that relates to any of the Business Entities
(or their assets or operations) and that is a refund or credit of Taxes with
respect to a Pre-Closing Period shall be the property of Seller or its
designee and shall be retained by Seller or its designee (or promptly
reimbursed to Seller or such designee by the Business Entity if any such
refund or credit (or interest thereon) is received by Buyer, a Business
Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates). Upon the
request of Seller, Buyer shall file, or cause the Business Entity or any of  



 

-41-  their Affiliates to file, a claim for refund of any Taxes, including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns or otherwise, relating to the
Business Entities (or their assets or operations) for any Pre-Closing Period
in such form as Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall, at its own
expense, have the sole right to prosecute such claim for refund. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall make a refund
claim with respect to amounts paid by or on behalf of the Company for the Pre-
Closing Period relating to excise taxes on cigars as soon as reasonably
possible after the Closing and promptly remit such refund to Seller upon
receipt of the refund. Buyer agrees that it will reasonably cooperate, and
cause the Business Entities or their Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, with
Seller and its representatives in connection therewith. Notwithstanding any
other portion of this _Section 7.4(a)_, Buyer shall not be required to file,
or cause the Business Entity or any of their Affiliates to file any claim for
refund in accordance with this _Section 7.4(a)_ if such claim for refund
would likely have a material adverse affect on Buyer, the Business Entities or
their Affiliates (without taking into account the payment of the refund to
Seller).

(b) Any refund or credit of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that
relates to any of the Business Entities and that is a refund or credit of
Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing Period shall be the property of Buyer or
the Business Entity and shall be retained by Buyer or the Business Entity (or
promptly paid by Seller to Buyer or the Business Entity if any such refund or
credit (or interest thereon) is received by Seller or the Continuing
Affiliates). 

(c) In applying _Section 7.4(a)_ and _Section 7.4(b)_, any refund or credit
of Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle Period (as defined
below) shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing
Period in accordance with _Section 7.3_.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 7.4_, Buyer shall
not be required to pay to Seller any refund of Tax to the extent such refund
was included in the Working Capital calculation or otherwise taken into
account under _Section 5.10(b)_.

Section 7.5. _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. (a) Seller shall file
or cause to be filed (i) any Subchapter S Group and any combined, consolidated
or unitary Return that includes both Seller or any Continuing Affiliate and
income or assets of any of the Business Entities and (ii) any other Return of
any of the Business Entities for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date provided that, except as required by applicable Law, all such Tax
Returns specified in clause (ii) of this sentence shall be filed in a manner
consistent with past practice, shall not include any change in method of
accounting and shall not include any Tax election that is inconsistent with
past practice. At least 15 Business Days prior to the due date (giving
effect to any extension thereof) for the filing of a Return described in
clause (i) or (ii) above, Seller shall provide Buyer a copy of such Return (or
a copy of a pro forma separate Return for the Business Entities in the case of
a Return described in clause (i)) for review and comment. Buyer shall provide
any comments to such Returns within 10 Business Days after receiving such
Returns and Seller shall consider any comments of Buyer in good faith. Seller
shall, reasonably promptly after the filing of a Return described in clause
(i) or (ii) above, provide Buyer a copy of such Return (or a copy of a pro
forma separate Return for the Business Entities in the case of a Return
described in clause (i)). Seller shall remit to the relevant Taxing Authority
all Taxes shown by such Returns to be due. Buyer shall cause the Business
Entities to furnish information, records and documents to Seller in connection
with any such Return in accordance with the past procedures, customs and
practices of Seller and the Business Entities or as reasonably requested by
Seller.



 

-42- (b) Except to the extent set forth in _Section 7.5(a)_, Buyer shall timely
file or cause to be timely filed all Returns of, or that include, any of the
Business Entities and shall pay or cause to be paid the Taxes shown to be due
thereon; provided that Seller shall pay its allocable share of any such Taxes
as provided in this _Article VII_.

(c) With respect to any Return of any of the Business Entities for a taxable
period that, with respect to such Business Entity, begins on or before and
ends after the Closing Date (such a Return, a " _Straddle Period Return_ " and
such a taxable period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), Buyer shall deliver a copy of
such Return to Seller at least 30 Business Days prior to the due date (giving
effect to any extension thereof), accompanied by an allocation between the
Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be due on
such Return and any amount the Seller could have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to _Section 7.2_. Such Return shall be prepared in
accordance with past practices of the Seller and the Business Entities. Such
Return and allocation shall be final and binding on Seller, unless, within 15
Business Days after the date of receipt by Seller of such Return and
allocation, Seller delivers to Buyer a written request for explanation of
items on or changes to such Return or allocation. If Seller delivers such a
request, then Buyer and Seller shall undertake in good faith to resolve the
issues raised in such request prior to the due date (including any extension
thereof) for filing such Return. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any
issue within 10 Business Days from the date of receipt by Buyer of the
request for changes, then Seller and Buyer jointly shall engage the Neutral
Accounting Firm to determine the correct treatment of the item or items in
dispute. Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall bear and pay one-half of the
fees and other costs charged by the Neutral Accounting Firm. The determination
of the Neutral Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto. Buyer shall not be entitled to file a Tax Return for any of the
Business Entities for any Pre-Closing Period (or portion of any Straddle
Period properly allocable to the Pre-Closing Period) in any jurisdiction in
which Seller has not filed a Tax Return for itself or the Business Entities
without the Sellers prior written consent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.5_, if the
Closing Date occurs before January 1, 2008, Seller shall, at its expense,
prepare and provide to Buyer, on or before July 15, 2008, a copy of the
RTC-101, Pennsylvania Capital Stock/Foreign Franchise Tax Return, for the
Company for the year ending December 31, 2007, accompanied by an allocation
between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown
to be due on such Return. Buyer will cooperate with Seller, pursuant to
_Section 7.7_, to provide the necessary information to Seller to prepare the
Return. Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed an extension of
time to file this Return after consultation with Seller regarding the
preparation of such extension. Such Return shall be prepared in accordance
with past practices of the Company. Such Return and allocation shall be final
and binding on Buyer and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
such Return as prepared by Seller, unless, within 30 Business Days after the
date of receipt by Buyer of such Return and allocation, Buyer delivers to
Seller a written request for explanation of items on or changes to such Return
or allocation. If Buyer delivers such a request, then Buyer and Seller shall
undertake in good faith to resolve the issues raised in such request prior to
the due date (including the extension thereof) for filing such Return. If
Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any issue within 10 Business Days from
the  



 

-43-  date of receipt by Seller of the request for changes, then Seller and Buyer
jointly shall engage the Neutral Accounting Firm to determine the
correct treatment of the item or items in dispute. Each of the Seller and the
Buyer shall bear and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by the
Neutral Accounting Firm. The determination of the Neutral Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto.

(e) In the case of each Straddle Period Return, not later than two Business
Days before the due date (including any extension thereof) for payment of
Taxes with respect to such Return, Seller shall pay to Buyer or the relevant
Business Entity the portion of the Taxes in connection with such Return for
which Seller is responsible pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(i)_.

Section 7.6. _Tax Contests_. (a) _Notices_. If any Taxing Authority asserts a
Tax Claim, then the party hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim
shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or parties hereto
within 10 Business Days of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure of such party to give such timely notice shall not relieve the other
party of any of its obligations under this _Article VII_ , except to the
extent that the other party is actually prejudiced thereby, and the amount of
reimbursement to which the Tax Indemnitee is entitled shall be reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the applicable Tax liability would have been less had
such notice of Tax Claim been timely delivered. Such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of
the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

(b) _Pre-Closing Taxable Periods_. Seller shall have the right to control, at
its own expense, any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other
proceeding by or against any Taxing Authority (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") in
respect of a Business Entity for any Pre-Closing Period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller (i) shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding and (ii) not settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
of Buyer, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could materially
affect Buyers, any Business Entitys, or their respective Affiliates
liability for Tax with respect to any Post-Closing Period; _provided_
_further_ , that Buyer, at its own expense, may control and contest any Tax
Proceeding for which Seller would otherwise have the right to control
under this _Section 7.6(b)_ if Seller declines to contest such Tax
Proceeding; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if Buyer exercises its
right to control and contest any Tax Proceeding under the preceding clause,
Buyer shall (a) provide Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed account
of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, and (b) not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining Sellers prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) _Straddle Periods_. Buyer shall have the right to control, at its own
expense, any Tax Proceeding in respect of a Business Entity for any Straddle
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer (i) shall provide Seller with a
timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding,
(ii) not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, of Seller, if such settlement, comprise or abandonment
could affect Sellers liability for Taxes under this _Article VII_ ; and (c)
shall consult with Seller in good faith concerning the appropriate strategy
for contesting such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ _further_ , that Seller, at its
own expense,  



 

-44-  may control and contest any Tax Proceeding for which Buyer would otherwise
have the right to control under this _Section 7.6(c)_ if Buyer declines to
control such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that if Seller
exercises its right to control and contest any Tax Proceeding under the
preceding clause, Seller shall (a) provide Buyer with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, and (b) not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, of Buyer, if such settlement, compromise or abandonment could affect
Buyers, any Business Entitys, or their respective Affiliates liability for
Tax with respect to any Post-Closing Period.

(d) _Post-Closing Taxable Periods_. Buyer shall have the right to control any
Tax Proceeding involving any of the Business Entities (other than any Tax
Proceeding which Seller is entitled to control under _Section 7.6(b),_ _(c)_
or _(e)_ ).

(e) _Control of Certain Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller shall have the right to control, at its own expense,
any Tax Proceeding (including Tax submissions) with respect to the matters set
forth on  _Schedule 7.1(d)(2)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter, including
negotiations and settlements with the applicable Taxing Authority, for Pre-
Closing Periods and Straddle Periods and the filing of any Tax Returns or
amended Tax Returns for the Business Entities for Pre-Closing Periods,
_provided_ , that Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of the Tax proceeding involving such matters and shall not
settle or compromise such proceeding, without obtaining Buyers prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller
shall pay any Taxes due in connection with the matters set forth on such
_Schedule 7.1(d)(2)_ allocable to Pre-Closing Periods; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt, any such Tax or Taxes shall be treated as a single
claim for purposes of _Section 7.2(b)(iv)_. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer
shall cause the Business Entities to execute any and all documents in order
for Seller to control and resolve such matters. Buyer shall (and shall cause
the Business Entities to) provide such cooperation, documentation and other
information as Seller may reasonably request and use their reasonable best
efforts to mitigate or reduce any Tax that could be imposed in connection with
such matters.

Section 7.7. _Cooperation_. Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, provide to each of the other parties hereto
such cooperation, documentation and information as any of them reasonably may
request in (i) filing any Return, amended Return or claim for refund, (ii)
determining a liability for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this
_Article VII_ or a right to refund of Taxes, (iii) conducting any Tax
Proceeding, (iv) determining an allocation of Taxes between a Pre-Closing
Period and Post-Closing Period or (v) preparing the schedules, Tax forms or
other materials relating to _Section 7.11_. Such cooperation and information
shall include providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Returns,
together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and
relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Taxing Authorities and relevant records concerning the
ownership and Tax basis of property and other information, which any such
party may possess. Each party will retain all Returns, schedules and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters,
of the Business Entities for Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods until
the later of (x) the expiration of the statute of limitations for the Tax
periods to which the Returns and other documents relate or (y) eight years
following the due  



 

-45-  date (without extension) for such Returns. Thereafter, the party holding
such Returns or other documents may dispose of them, _provided_ that such
party shall give to the other party written notice prior to doing so. Each
party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents or information so
provided. Each party required to file Returns pursuant to this _Article VII_
shall bear all costs of filing such Returns. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to retain
copies of all Tax Returns related to the income or operations of the Business
Entities for all Pre-Closing Periods and information, records and documents
relating to the Taxes and the preparation of Returns for any Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period. The parties further agree to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including, but without limitation to, with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

Section 7.8. _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all
Tax allocation or sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements
relating to Tax matters between any of the Business Entities on the one hand
and Seller or any Continuing Affiliate on the other hand shall be terminated
with respect to each of the Business Entities as of the day before the
Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, the Business Entities shall
not have any rights or obligations thereunder for any past or future period.

Section 7.9. _Buyer Consolidated Returns_. Notwithstanding any other
provision, (a) Buyer shall be entitled to control in all respects, and
neither Seller nor any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any of them shall be
entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with respect to any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes Buyer or any other
member of the Buyer Group and (b) Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
shall not be required to provide any Person with any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return or copy thereof that includes Buyer or any other member of
the Buyer Group ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that to the extent that such Tax
Returns would be required to be delivered but for this _Section 7.9(b)_, the
Person that would be required to deliver such Tax Returns shall instead
deliver pro forma Tax Returns relating solely to the Business Entities).

Section 7.10. _Seller Consolidated Returns_. Notwithstanding any other
provision, (a) except to the extent set forth in _Section 7.6_, Seller shall
be entitled to control in all respects, and neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax
Proceeding with respect to any Subchapter S Return or any consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Return that includes Seller or any Continuing
Affiliate and (b) Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not be
required to provide any Person with any Subchapter S Return or any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return or copy thereof that includes
Seller or any other Continuing Affiliate ( _provided_ , _however_ , that to
the extent that such Tax Returns would be required to be delivered but
for this _Section 7.10(b)_, the Person that would be required to deliver
such Tax Returns shall instead deliver pro forma Tax Returns relating solely
to the Business Entities).



 

-46- Section 7.11. _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Stock Purchase shall be treated as a purchase of all of the assets of
the Business Entities. The parties further agree that where applicable, such
treatment shall apply for state, local, and foreign income tax purposes.

(b) Within eighty (80) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare a
schedule (the " _Draft Allocation_ ") allocating the Purchase Price and any
other consideration paid by Buyer (or deemed to be paid by Buyer) to Seller
among the assets of the Business Entities (the " _Assets_ ") including the
non-competition and non-solicitation covenants set forth in the Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement (" _Covenant_ "). The allocation
shall be done in such a manner so as to comply with the requirements of
Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations. Within
forty-five (45) days of its receipt of such Draft Allocation, Buyer will
provide Seller with a written notice of any proposed changes thereto,
together with a detailed explanation of the basis for such proposed changes.
If Buyer does not provide Seller with any proposed changes within such forty-
five (45) day period, the Draft Allocation shall become final (the " _Final
Allocation_ "). If Buyer timely notifies Seller of any proposed changes to the
Draft Allocation, the parties shall discuss such proposed changes in good
faith and shall attempt to resolve any dispute. If the parties are able to
reach a mutually satisfactory agreement as to any proposed changes, the Draft
Allocation shall be modified to reflect such agreed changes and shall become
the Final Allocation. In the event that the parties cannot agree on an
allocation schedule within twenty-five (25) days after Sellers receipt of
Buyers notice of proposed changes, the dispute shall be resolved by a Neutral
Valuation Firm; _provided_ that if the dispute involves the valuation of the
Covenant, then, at the option of Seller, the disputed allocations to be
resolved by the Neutral Valuation Firm shall not include the valuation of
Covenant, and the parties may rely upon their respective valuations of the
Covenant for Tax purposes, and shall not be bound by the other partys
valuation of the Covenant in filing their Tax Returns and reports required
under Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations. In
such case, the allocation to Goodwill by the Neutral Valuation Firm shall
assume a zero value for the Covenant and the parties would reduce their
allocation to Goodwill by the amount they allocate to the Covenant for
purposes of the allocation under Section 1060 of the Code. If the dispute
involves the valuation of the Covenant and Seller does not exercise its option
not to have the Neutral Valuation Firm value the Covenant, then the dispute
involving the Covenant shall be resolved by the Neutral Valuation Firm along
with other disputed items. Subject to the foregoing, the resolution by such
Neutral Valuation Firm shall be binding on both parties. The Draft Allocation
shall be modified to reflect such resolution (and any other agreed proposed
changes) and shall become the Final Allocation (or if the parties have not
agreed to an allocation with respect to the Covenant (and such valuation is
not determined by a Neutral Valuation Firm), as adjusted by each party to
reflect their allocation to the Covenant, a " _Limited Final Allocation_ ").

(c) If there is an increase or decrease in consideration within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-1(e)(ii)(B) after the parties have
filed the initial IRS Form 8594, the parties shall allocate such increase or
decrease (or if they cannot agree to such an allocation, a Neutral Valuation
Firm shall allocate) the increase or decrease in consideration paid by Buyer
to Seller among the Assets as required by and consistent with Section 1060 and
the applicable Treasury Regulations which shall be the revised
Final Allocation or revised Limited Final Allocation.



 

-47- (d) If there is a Final Allocation, Seller shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) an IRS Form 8594 (including any necessary supplement) consistent
with the allocation set forth in the Final Allocation (or any revision
thereto) and shall timely deliver a copy thereof to Buyer. Seller and Buyer
shall each file such completed IRS Form 8594 (including any necessary
supplement) with the IRS in a timely manner. If there is a Limited Final
Allocation, Seller and Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) an IRS
Form 8594 (including any necessary supplements) consistent with the
Limited Final Allocation (or any revision thereto). Seller and Buyer shall
file such IRS Form 8594 (including any necessary supplement) with the IRS in a
timely manner.

(e) The parties hereto shall make consistent use of and adhere to the Final
Allocation or Limited Final Allocation (or if applicable, the most recent
revised Final Allocation or Limited Final Allocation) for all Tax purposes
and in all filings, declarations and reports with the IRS in respect thereof,
including the reports required to be filed under Section 1060 of the Code and
the applicable Treasury Regulations. The parties shall not take, or cause
or permit to be taken any position on any Tax Return which would be
inconsistent with or prejudice the allocations set forth on the Final
Allocation or Limited Final Allocation (or if applicable, the most recent
revised Final Allocation or Limited Final Allocation). In any action or
proceeding related to the determination of any Tax, neither Buyer nor Seller
(or their respective Affiliates) shall contend or represent that such Final
Allocation or Limited Final Allocation (or if applicable, the most recent
revised Final Allocation or Limited Final Allocation) is not a correct
allocation. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Final
Allocation or Limited Final Allocation shall not be binding for any purpose
other than Tax purposes.

Section 7.12. _Post-Closing Actions which Affect Seller Tax Indemnitee s
Liability for Taxes for Pre-Closing Periods_.

(a) Except as provided elsewhere in this _Article VII_ or as required by law,
none of Buyer, any of the Business Entities or any of their Affiliates shall
make any election, take any action, or amend, re-file or otherwise modify any
Tax Return previously filed with any Taxing Authority, relating in whole or in
part to any Business Entity with respect to any Pre-Closing Period, if doing
so would increase a Seller Tax Indemnitees liability for Taxes for any Pre-
Closing Period (including any indemnification liability of Seller under
_Article VII_ of this Agreement), without the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent should not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided, that the parties agree that filing any Straddle Period or Post-
Closing Period Tax Return (or extension thereof) for the matters set forth on
_Schedule 7.1(d)(2)_ to the Seller Disclosure Letter seven (7) days before
the due date of such Tax Return or later is expressly permitted.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Buyer, a Business Entity nor any of their Affiliates shall waive any statute
of limitations or agree to any extensions thereof in respect to any Pre-
Closing Period without the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent
should not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



 

-48- Section 7.13. _Survival_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the representations, warranties, and obligations (including the
obligations for indemnification) provided in this _Article VII_ shall survive
for thirty (30) days following the termination of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the Tax to which such representation, warranty,
or obligation relate.

Section 7.14. _Characterization of Payments_. Any indemnity payment made to
Seller, Buyer, or any Business Entity pursuant to this _Article VII_ or
_Article IX_ of this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment of the
Purchase Price for all purposes, including Tax purposes, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law.

given with reasonable specificity (in light of the extent of the information
that Seller has or should reasonably have with respect to such claim) to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 9.4_ hereof for such indemnification, the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall continue to have the right to be indemnified with

Section 9.4. _Indemnification Procedures_. (a) Upon obtaining knowledge of any
claim or demand which has given rise to, or is reasonably expected to give
rise to, a claim for indemnification hereunder, Buyer or Seller, as the case

demand to the other. The party giving such Notice of Claim shall furnish to
the other party in reasonable detail such information as the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, may have with
respect to such indemnification claim (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on it and any written
claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the
same). Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 9.2(b)_ and _9.3(b)_
hereof, no failure or delay by Buyer or Seller in the performance of the
foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of Seller or Buyer
(such party the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), respectively, to indemnify and hold
the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties,
respectively, harmless, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall
have been materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(b) If the claim or demand set forth in the Notice of Claim given pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_ hereof is a claim or demand asserted by a third party, the
party receiving such Notice of Claim shall have 20 days after the date on
which Notice of Claim is given to notify the party giving such Notice of Claim
in writing of its election to defend such third party claim or demand on
behalf of the party seeking indemnification. If the party receiving such
Notice of Claim elects, on behalf of the Indemnifying Party , to defend such
third party claim or demand,  



 

-54-  the party seeking indemnification (such party, the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall make available to the Indemnifying Party and its agents
and representatives all records and other materials which are reasonably
required in the defense of such third party claim or demand and shall,
pursuant to the Indemnifying Partys reasonable request, otherwise reasonably
cooperate with, and assist the Indemnifying Party in the defense of, such
third party claim or demand at the Indemnifying Partys expense, and so long
as Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, is defending such third party claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, settle or compromise such
third party claim or demand. In such case, the Indemnifying Party may settle
or compromise such third party claim or demand (i) with the written consent of
Seller or Buyer, on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties or the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (it being understood and agreed that the withholding of
consent with respect to any of the matters referred to in subclause (A), (B)
or (C) in the following clause (ii) shall not be deemed unreasonable), or (ii)
without such consent, so long as such settlement includes (A) an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Parties from all liability in respect of such
claim or litigation, (B) does not subject the Indemnified Parties to any
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (C) does not include an
affirmative statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act
by any Indemnified Party. If the party receiving such Notice of Claim elects
to defend such third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of such third party claim or demand,
at such Indemnified Partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Parties for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of
such claim or demand and as set forth in the next sentence. In the event that
representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both such Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Parties could reasonably be expected to represent a
conflict of interest for such counsel, then the Indemnified Parties may
employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in any such action or
proceeding and the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings, be liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition
to local counsel) in respect of any claim for all Buyer Indemnified Parties or
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be. If the party receiving such
Notice of Claim does not elect to defend such third party claim or demand or
does not defend such third party claim or demand in good faith, the
Indemnified Parties shall have the right, in addition to any other right or
remedy they may have hereunder, at the Indemnifying Parties expense if the
Indemnifying Parties are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for
such third-party claim or demand under _Article IX_ of this Agreement, to
defend such third party claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
such Indemnified Parties shall not have any obligation to participate in the
defense of, or defend, any such third party claim or demand; (ii) such
Indemnified Parties defense of or participation in the defense of any such
third party claim or demand shall not in any way diminish or lessen the
obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under the agreements of
indemnification set forth in this _Article IX_ ; and (iii) such Indemnified
Parties may not settle any claim without the consent of Seller or Buyer,
respectively, on behalf of Seller or Buyer, respectively (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) Subject to the limitations in _Section 9.5_, (i) Seller shall satisfy its
obligations under this  _Article IX_ in respect of a valid claim for
indemnification hereunder which is not contested by Seller (A) at such time as
there are any funds remaining in the Escrow Fund, by delivering a joint notice
along with Buyer to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the  



 

-55-  Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse funds from the
Escrow Fund to Buyer in the amount of the lesser of such obligations or
the remaining amount of funds in the Escrow Fund and (B) at such time as
there are no longer any funds remaining in the Escrow Fund (including with
respect to any obligations only a portion of which is disbursable to Buyer
pursuant to the foregoing clause (A)), within 30 days after the date on which
Notice of Claim is given by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to
the account specified by Buyer and (ii) Buyer shall satisfy its obligations
under this _Article IX_ in respect of a valid claim for indemnification
hereunder which is not contested by Buyer within 30 days after the date on
which Notice of Claim is given by wire transfer, in immediately available
funds, to the account specified by Seller.

 

Section 9.5. _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) Seller shall have no
liability for indemnification pursuant to clause (i) of  _Section 9.2(a)_
(or by reason of any certification in respect of such representations and
warranties) with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder (x) unless such Covered Losses exceed in the aggregate
fourteen million, five hundred thousand dollars ($14,500,000), in which case
Seller shall be liable (subject to clause (y) below) for all such Covered
Losses in excess of such amount or (y) in the aggregate in excess of
one hundred forty-five million dollars ($145,000,000). The Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall look first to the Escrow Fund for any payment of indemnification
claims pursuant to _Section 9.2_.

(b) Buyer shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to clause (i)
of _Section 9.3(a)_ (or by reason of any certification in respect of such
representations and warranties) with respect to Covered Losses for which
indemnification is provided thereunder (x) unless such Covered Losses exceed
in the aggregate fourteen million five hundred thousand dollars
($14,500,000), in which case Buyer shall be liable (subject to clause (y)
below) for all such Covered Losses in excess of such amount or (y) in the
aggregate in excess of one hundred forty-five million dollars ($145,000,000).

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall, in any
event, be liable under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ or _Article VII _ to any other
Person for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive
damages of such other Person, including loss of future revenue, income or
profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach thereof (other than to the extent
the third party has been awarded such in a third party claim).

(d) Neither Seller nor the Buyer shall have Liability under _Sections 9.2_ or
_9.3,_ or to the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties,
as the case may be, in respect of any Covered Losses to the extent (but only
to the extent) that:

(i) the Covered Loss (or any part thereof) in question arises, or is
increased, as a result of a change after the Closing in any accounting
policy, any Tax reporting practice or the length of any accounting period for
Tax purposes of the Business Entities (in the case of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties) or Seller and its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Seller
Indemnified Parties);



 

-56- (ii) in the case of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Covered Loss (or any
part thereof) in question arises from or relates to (a) any product Liability
arising from the research, development, manufacture, sale, advertising,
distribution, consuming, marketing or use of cigar or pipe tobacco products or
(b) the MSA; or 

(iii) the Covered Loss (A) was within the category covered by, and together
with other Covered Losses in such category not exceeding the amount provided
for in, the reserve reflected on the Business Balance Sheet or (B) was
included in the Working Capital calculation or otherwise taken into account
under _Section 5.10(b)_.

(e) The amount of any Covered Losses under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ or _Article
VII_ sustained by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party
shall be reduced by any amount received by such Person (or an Affiliate
thereof) with respect thereto under any insurance coverage (including pursuant
to _Section 5.9(b)_) or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor, and by the amount of any Tax benefit actually realized with respect
to the Covered Loss, in each case net of costs incurred. The Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance
coverage and from such other Person alleged to have responsibility with
respect to the Covered Loss. If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party realizes a Tax benefit or receives an amount under
insurance coverage or from such other Person with respect to Covered Losses
sustained at any time subsequent to any indemnification payment pursuant to
_Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ or _Article VII_ , then such Buyer Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the applicable
Indemnifying Party for any payment made to the Indemnified Party by such
Indemnifying Party up to such amount realized or received by the Buyer
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable.

(f) Upon making any indemnification payment under _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ or
this  _Article VII_ , the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any
third party in respect of the Covered Loss to which the payment relates;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that until the Indemnified Party recovers full
payment of its Covered Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party
against any such third party on account of said payment are hereby made
expressly subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the Indemnified
Partys rights against such third party.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers
indemnification obligation under this _Article IX_ for a breach of _Section
3.15_ (or any certification in respect thereof) is subject to the provisions
of this _Section 9.5(g)_. Seller shall be responsible for the cost of
Remedial Action only to the extent necessary to reasonably comply with the
remediation or compliance standard consistent with the industrial/commercial
use of the property as intended to be used as the Closing Date,
which standard will be reasonable, if acceptable to the applicable Government
Authorities. Seller shall not be responsible for those costs incurred in
connection with a Remedial Action to the extent such costs arise from or are
exacerbated by actions of Buyer or the Business Entities after the Closing.
Further, Seller shall not be responsible for costs incurred in connection with
a Remedial Action unless such Remedial Action is (i) required by a
Governmental Authority acting pursuant to Environmental Law; (ii) required to
respond to a judgment or an order brought by a third party; (iii) required to
respond to a condition discovered in connection with the normal day-to-day
operation of a facility based on the continued  



 

-57-  operation of the Business as presently conducted or a facility expansion,
demolition or closure actually implemented by Buyer where such Remedial Action
is necessary to permit such operation, expansion, demolition or closure; or
(iv) required to respond to a condition which presents a substantial
endangerment to human health; provided that Seller shall have no Liability or
responsibility for any of the matter described in the immediately preceding
clauses (i) through (iv) to the extent that such matter arises from product
Liability due to the research, development, manufacture, sale, advertising,
distribution, consuming, marketing or use of cigars or pipe tobacco products.

(h) Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2_ for a
breach by Seller of its obligations under clause (i) of _Section 5.10(b)_ to
the extent Closing Working Capital is less than $32.4 million unless the
amount of such shortfall exceeds $750,000, in which case the amount of any
such shortfall which Buyer shall be entitled to recover under _Section 9.2_
shall be limited to the amount of such shortfall in excess of $750,000 and
provided that any such claim shall have been made within 90 days following the
Closing Date. 

Section 9.6. _Exclusive Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article IX_ , the above provisions of this _Article IX_
shall not apply to Tax indemnification matters, which matters shall instead be
governed by _Article VII_.

Section 9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _ARTICLE IX_
 AND _ARTICLE VII_ SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT
TO A BREACH OF OR DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OTHER THAN ANY VIOLATION OF A COVENANT IN
_ARTICLE V_ , _VI_  OR _VII_ (OTHER THAN PARAGRAPHS (a) THROUGH (d) of
_SECTION 7.2_ ) WHICH BY ITS TERMS IS TO BE PERFORMED FOLLOWING THE CLOSING,
FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHALL ALSO BE AVAILABLE. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING,
FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONTRACTUAL, STATUTORY,
EQUITABLE OR COMMON LAW RIGHTS OR REMEDIES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTIES OF ANY
NATURE. THIS _SECTION 9.7_ SHALL NOT APPLY IN RESPECT OF CLAIMS FOR FRAUD OR
INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION. 

ARTICLE X __

_Termination_

Section 10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing by: 

(a) Buyer and Seller by mutual written agreement;

(b) either Buyer or Seller if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by the
close of business on May 1, 2008, which date may be extended by up to 120
additional days (in 30-day increments) by either party, if the Closing has not
occurred by the then-  



 

-58-  effective Termination Date due to the failure to satisfy one or more of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (except that a party whose breach
has caused such condition not to be satisfied shall not have the right to so
extend the Termination Date) (as it may be extended, the " _Termination Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to (i)
Buyer, if its failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or
before the Termination Date or (ii) Seller, if its failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before the Termination Date; or

(c) either Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which such party shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as
applicable, in accordance with _Section 5.2_) permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Stock Purchase, and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.

Section 10.2. _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of
termination of this Agreement by either or both of Buyer and Seller pursuant
to _Section 10.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the
terminating party to the other, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate
and become void and have no effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be abandoned without further action by the parties hereto, except that
the provisions of this _Section 10.2_, the Confidentiality Agreement and
_Article XI_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

(b) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated and at such time any
party hereto is in material breach of, or material default under, any term or
provision hereof, such termination shall be without prejudice to, and shall
not affect, any and all rights to damages that the other party may
have hereunder or otherwise under applicable Law.

ARTICLE XI

_Miscellaneous_

Section 11.1. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

Section 11.2. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial_.
(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without reference to the choice of law
principles thereof.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Action with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party
hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom  



 

-59-  within the State of Delaware (or, if the U.S. Federal District Court has
exclusive jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware) (such courts, the " _Subject Courts_ "). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Action. The parties further agree, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, that any final and unappealable judgment
against any of them in any Action contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

(c) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
such party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement.

(d) Each party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement. Each party certifies that it has been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications set forth above in this _Section 11.2_.

Section 11.3. _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Subject Court,
including without limitation, with respect to the parties obligation to
consummate the Closing pursuant to the terms hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in equity.

Section 11.4.  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Exhibits hereto, the Seller Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no agreements,
understandings, representations or warranties between the parties with respect
thereto other than those set forth or referred to herein. Except for _Section
5.11_, which is intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, the DandO
Indemnitees and the DandO Released Parties, as applicable, _Section 7.2_, which
is intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the Buyer Tax Indemnitees
and the Seller Tax Indemnitees,  _Section 9.2_ which is intended to benefit,
and be enforceable by, the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and _Section 9.3_ which
is intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, the Seller Indemnified Parties,
this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person not a party hereto
(and their successors and assigns permitted by _Section 11.7_) any rights or
remedies hereunder.



  

-60- Section 11.5. _Expenses_. Except as set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, whether the Stock Purchase is or is not consummated, all legal,
investment banking and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such costs and expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, any
costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby by Seller and its Subsidiaries (including the Business
Entities) prior to the Closing, including any arrangements referred to in
_Section 3.14_ with respect to the Seller Financial Advisor (including any
indemnity obligations to the Seller Financial Advisor), shall be deemed
incurred by Seller or one or more of its Subsidiaries, and not by any of
the Business Entities.

all purposes hereunder if in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly

another party hereto with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part

participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all parties and no
